sentiments,cleaned_review
neutral,really fills the room with sound for such small device struggles with heavy bass in some hip hop music selections but for every other genre the sound is clean and louder than expected 
neutral,sounds good so far
positive,love it it fits my hand just right only issue is that it came in another language 
positive,it pretty good for the price 
negative,needs to be charged all the time not very comfortable to use

positive,perfect just what needed love that can use with my mac and pc mouse is smooth fast and accurate 
positive,i love the colors that it shuffles through also like that it is virtually sound proof no more hearing click from across the room only thing wish could pick stationary color instead of that feature always being red 
positive,overall really liked the mouse enjoyed the colors and the feel of it was very nice the main problem had is that specifically bought it for work for my mac laptop the adapter didn work at all had to keep holding it down at specific angle in order to use it at all very disappointing 
positive,sounds really good for music not what it is intended for but really good bass and sound for music slight complaints about mic but overall good for gaming too for the price cannot complain

neutral,do not buy does not last for more than hrs on full charge thought the first one was defective since its advertised hrs of battery life flat out lie 
positive,it easy to charge and no batteries required really like it
positive,the mouse drags after use for like an hour battery does not last too long it takes longer to charge then the amount of time been use will not buy look for better quality name brand do not recomend at all wish can get my money back
positive,this is one of the most comfortable and user friendly mouses have used the sleek design makes for easy rest on your wrist and responds easily and effortlessly best feature it seeps if not used so it saves on the charge last for good use 
positive,the mouse is big enough to use and very smooth with my computer always look for wireless mouse so this one is the best on amazon that could find highly recommended 
negative,pretty colors but some of the keys are off and in weird location kept hitting the wrong key returned right away 
neutral,i purchased two of these one was refurbished and the other brand new surprisingly the refurbished one works flawlessly but the new one has many issues you have to twist around the aux plug in and it cuts out until you twist it again the mic cuts out as well some cracklings sounds wouldn purchase again only due to the unreliability 
positive,i really enjoyed this mouse that arrived so promptly after my first few clicks realized it is the best mouse had ever used for regular writing needs the design color is very stylish too 
positive,best speaker ever 
positive,it cool and colorful love it 
negative,very bad advertising in the process of sending this back as it doesn work with xbox one 
positive,i got this when it was on sale for off and consider myself to have been ripped off this keyboard sucks it sometimes works sometimes it doesnt even keeping it plugged in defeating the whole purpose of wireless keyboard doesn guarantee it will work the lights are cool or whatever but they don make up have unconscionably awful it is even something as simple as writing this review is taking three times longer than it should do not buy you have been warned keep looking there are better products from better companies do yourself favor spend that extra thirty seconds spend the same money and get working product

neutral,hard to install mic
positive,low profile feels good in the hand responsive
negative,the mouse works fine but was disappointed that the color did not match my macbook as it shows 
positive,this keyboard is not silent the keys do click not as loud as the other keyboards ve had but this is why bought it to be soundless know keyboards won be silent but can tell why they put that in their description when it just as loud as other keyboards also when you aren typing and the lights are showing you can hear humming sound coming from the board and it doesn go away until the lights shut off do live the lighted keyboard just wish it bit more quiet

positive,i bought this for my year old and he loved it very easy to use and it automatically goes in sleep mode if you forget to turn it off we have had it and used it for months and haven had to charge it yet 
neutral,very nice sound 
positive,i like that this mouse os sleek in design has long battery life and is easy to set up often forget to turn it off but that doesn matter because it goes into sleep mode to preserve battery the only concern my tablet has type so the converter is helpful the only thing that would change is that the converter doesn fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet 
negative,worked flawlessly for few days then the left button became unreliable not worth the hassle to return update seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered refund if took down this review replied rather have corrected unit which would then review they replied they weren fixed yet and offered to my refund ignored it 
neutral,lightweight easy bluetooth connection the glow adds an extra pizzazz 
negative,it was nice and sleek it felt very cheaply made though and it died within weeks of having it wouldn turn on even charged it would not recommend buying it 
neutral,out of the package my initial thoughts were that the product seemed very cheaply made and those thoughts were confirmed when after one month of use the product stopped working would not recommend this product 
positive,works awesome haven had to charge it for couple weeks now 
positive,i loved this product it was gift one of the best how can you ask for anything better the quality is awesome the sound is fantastic it easy to use and understand the manual found the light colored devices get dirty quickly that the sucky part no case to keep it clean while it being used the bluetooth compatibility is also keeper getting awesome range as well just for reference the charging port tents to get lose multiple of my friends say the same thing but no worries you won regret it trust me 
positive,very nice work done on these speakers the sound is rich and beautiful the bass function is amazing it last long the battery charge indicator is perfect and very useful these speakes las very long on single charge the only thing is little uncomfortable is the portability it big and heavy and no handles you will have to buy carrying case separately it too big for easy portability but overall am very satisfied with this device am buying two next time gave this one to granma next time will buy two to pair up it worthy very amazing sound 
positive,looking to buy other products from this seller packaging was great and happy with the keyboard easy to type and fits my style of simplistic yet modern look feel
positive,so far it sounds great

neutral,doesn work on the white surface white desk 
positive, love this speaker going to buy second one so can pair them together
neutral,i like the look and feel of this mouse it is clean and fits my hand well my complaint is with the working of it after only months the scroll wheel has quit working about weeks ago it began with the cursor jumping when pulled down on the wheel but now it only barely works pull down on the wheel and either nothing happens at all or the line on the page jumps down one line and then stops altogether will see if can get it fixed or replaced but this was new item and should have worked year or more without issues it makes me very sad 
positive,fits well to contour of hand withstands multiple drops to the floor battery lasts quite while after charging color changing is pretty

neutral,bought this mouse on december its october and no matter how long charge it the only thing it does is blink the red light once and die don recommend this at all

neutral,excelente
positive,not bad for the price like it
negative,the mouse can use but the back side of the light is broke 
positive,jbl does it again with perfect sounding product
positive,i bought this because trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it not worth it the mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want like it pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this thankfully play with controller so it doesn hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don get this 
negative,the sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but ve noticed something after couple of weeks of use the ear pieces aren comfortable for adults due to them being too small and what even worse is that wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gaming have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort so warning not recommended with glasses and or adults 
positive,speaker sounds good connects quick and battery lasts long time seems durable and well built
neutral,it was easy to install and worked the first time 
positive,i got this mouse for my year daughter for christmas she loves how it fits her hands and how is changes colors what she likes the most is how quiet it is when clicking the button the family wireless mouse is bit loud when clicked she will be using it for school and her chromebook not really gaming mouse and there is only buttons and wheel 
positive,i have been using this mouse for couple of weeks now love the rechargeable feature and the battery seems to last long time never turn it off highly recommend this one 
positive,this product is very cheaply made purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse however the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on web page easily breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one buyer beware take it from father who has went through of them 
positive,very useful play online games and it works for that very happy with my purchase 
positive,excellent sound it has tons of bass which was looking for 
neutral,my only complaint is these were meant to be christmas present and never expected they would not be in box or something and the person they were for answered door and since he asked for them he knew they were his kinda ruined that gift
neutral,it takes as much time to charge the mouse as to use it not practical otherwise the mouse worksand it is ergonomical

negative,low end performance not as comfortable as expected 
neutral,dislike
neutral,i professional who writes lot and thought on giving this low budget keyboard try it is not suitable for heavy writing work as it becomes really heavy on the hands after few thousand words it is however well designed keyboard that can be used for simple daily computing 
positive,my son takes this with him where ever he goes the sound is great and the camo is nice touch for guy 
neutral,bought it expecting to be able to use it and it didn have the adapter like it is stated 
positive,i bought one of these last year for one of my laptops and loved it so when the other mouses mice meeces whatever went bought more they are quiet and very easy to use this time forgot that the one usb connector was on the bottom so was ready to send back and exchange it but when went to pack it up saw it on the bottom thank goodness because really like them 
positive,so far this has been an impressive speaker use by the pool in the garage on patio anytime we want some music outside the battery hasn dropped below two lights out of have used for up to hours and recharged an iphone from to and still had three lights on the time got it to lights when had it playing close to hours on and off outside the bass is good when you are short distance away and the volume moderately high when you are right next to it the bass response is little odd with the bass expander or resonators sounding little rubbery once you get little distance it sounds great especially next to structures it makes the bass sound better bluetooth range is fantastic easily feet outdoors with no obstructions also the splash proof features makes it safe for the splash zone next to pool in the garage it really good while working bt connects within seconds recommend 
neutral,when playing games can hear the other players but cannot talk to them that feature quit shortly after receiving the headset 
neutral,i ve been through two of these mice the first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working opted for an exchange but the new one had the same issue after about weeks looking through reviews it seems to be common issue returning this for another brand 
positive,great product
positive,for the price these are amazing and the best headphones for the price if you re casually gaming and or have neighbors that don like hearing noises this is the headset for you if you re competing online and need to communicate clearly with your teammates do not recommend this headset for you because the audio is not crystal clear from the built in microphone 
negative,my first concern is that it does not give you warning when it needs recharging it just dies out if you are using your usb for something else you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse second the charge does not last long very frustrating and now the most important it died just stopped working oh well so much for fancy going back to battery operated mouse 
neutral,this is the second one that stopped working within year
neutral,love it iv had it for about months now and can only recall time it went dead it wouldn have went dead if it weren for me neglecting to charge it but it left on for couple days other then that its great mouse use it almost everyday and only find myself charging it about once month 
neutral,product was as described lighted keys assists with night gaming and work 
neutral,i purchase this mouse for my kid he had an old one using batteries only he is frustrated by replacing batteries so frequently every weeks like the feature including rechargeable and charge when you use it it really creates big convenience for children now he can stop looking for the new batteries around the house 
neutral,i like everything about this product
positive,surprised how sharp it looked when first seeing it but it is even better than it looks 
positive,love love love this speaker great sound and battery lasts forever

neutral,loved this at first but after only few weeks it no longer holds charge and no longer functions 
positive,get what you pay for build quality is plasticky so don expect more than years tops sound quality is pretty good but the microphone isn particularly astounding 
positive,this mouse was great for about two months then it stopped charging and won work don waste your money 
positive,meets my needs and really enjoy it goes into sleep mode when not in use 
positive,my son loves these headphones they worked great with his nintendo switch and they were very reasonably priced 
neutral,stopped working from one day to the next 
neutral,purchased for imac compter seamless setup and operation 
positive,the sound is awesomely fantastic jbl is worth every penny the bass is beautiful the battery is long lasting can charge it to full and don hav to charge it again for another days sometimes longer jbl is great product tried other bluetooth speakers always go bak to jbl no comparison

positive,silent clicks works great takes getting used to lower profile not having to worry about battery is golden 
negative,rechargeable comfortable haven killed it yet use it at work haven killed the battery but charge it overnight lasts the day for me
neutral,i would buy it against it pretty not really bling just sleek 
neutral,i have had this mouse for less than weeks it charges doesn work at all go buy name brand that will work for more than minutes 
neutral,i like the volume mixer so can change the volume sound 
neutral,when this gets low on battery it starts to flicker out where the mouse will stop and start sending information so your clicks won register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen the added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about min to an hour of use and then it acts like that for the next several hours it nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long it shame because love how stylized it is but it basically unusable 
positive,awesome gaming stereo set am purchasing another one for friendthank you bengoo
neutral,last me long time never have any problems
positive,i loved this mouse it was so pretty and the glided really smoothly everything worked great for about month and now the mouse won turn on ve charged it fully and whenever attempt to turn the switch on it shuts right back off that being said did buy another one being under don mind having to replace it hopefully it was fluke with the first mouse and this second one will work for much longer than few weeks if the same thing happens again will not be purchasing third 
neutral,it was nice while it lasted unfortunately for me that was less than three months 
positive,these are the best speakers high quality excellent sound waterproof can also connect with several other speakers same type of course to creat surround sound highly recommended 
positive,great headset if you are starting out as streamer or trying to save on some money it cancels out lot of noise it comfortable to wear and easy to adjust would recommend this it has nice bass and super loud you can adjust the volume 
neutral,loved this but based on other reviews not the only one with this issue stopped recharging and working after months 
positive,it looks awesome and is really quiet only had it for short time but love it 
neutral,broke so fast made out of plastic if you dropped it on your bed it could ve broke it antique at this point do not buy this please at all costs

positive,it is really great it don need charge for days then finally dead on me love it really cute and colorful use lots use with my macbook pro 
positive,the battery doesn even last one day pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and have the light setting turned off it looks like nice mouse and the wheel and clicking is fine but what the point if it never charged don waste your money on this mouse 
positive,great product and price customer service is professional and timely 
positive,the headphones work very well and are comfortable to wear 
positive,found these to be decent quality with good sound cord set is of decent strength and they are still working well
neutral,as described
negative,i am big on reviews peoples honest opinions when it counts as for style it nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good even if it completely charged it will only work for about minutes before it starts to freeze then eventually go dead it very frustrating annoying especially if you work from home would of posted pic but am in the process of returning it don feel like getting it 
neutral,goes through batteries like water
neutral,colors are fun but it doesn react great charge doesn last long if you forget to turn it off over night when it low on battery it doesn work well overall it an inconvenience amending my review to include the following if you post bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down first by offering refund when you tell them not interested they then offered bucks you can pay me to take review down that the point of review just make better product you should just refund me 
positive,the sound from the headphones are good however the microphone is barely picking up any sound ve adjusted sensitivity levels and microphone boost to no avail the only way it picks up sound is if by hand pull the mic closer to my mouth which kind of defeats the purpose super unfortunate 
neutral,do not buy weak flimsy crap
neutral,quality of product and sound are very good 
negative,the battery made it two years but now it no longer holds charge and the charge has to be plugged in at all times to work battery can no be changed out only one year warranty and that doesn include battery issues previously had bose and they stand by their products including dead batteries 
negative,this was disappointing and irritating order am college student and full time manager so work lot on my laptop ordered mouse for ease of certain tasks that required right click or highlights this mouse was unusable directly out of the box charged it up and it never held charge long enough to work very disappointing and waste of time 
positive,excellent
positive,my son loves his speaker it goes everywhere with him

positive,cheap cheap cheap cheapquit working like day and now am outside of return window good thing it was cheap buyers beware spend little more 
positive,great for gaming on xbox
positive, love that the colors change it perfect haven even had to charge it since got it 
positive,this thing is loud and sounds awesome had the jbl version of this and one day it just got really quite have only used the jbl once but love the sound and volume will probably use it over the stereo system in my boat which is pretty nice because this thing sounds so good 
negative,this mouse was waste of money it broke after using it one month bought another mouse couple weeks ago and it will not charge do not recommend this mouse 
neutral,pretty easy to use and set up comes with charger expected the lights to be bit more appealing but they re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain probably wouldn use for gaming purposes though 
positive,the mouse definitely makes difference when it comes to the clicking sound everyone is glad there is no more of that it slim rechargeable and decent looking 
positive,great for gaming 
positive,love the clickity clicks of the mouse got it for my daughter for online school work and she loves the damn thing 
neutral,within month of buying this the connection would short out it would only work if twisted the end and held it there luckily it stopped working within the return window and was able to get refund will not purchase from this manufacturer again 
neutral,the wheel button feels like it requires the force to activate and makes the noise of the other buttons whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun the wheel button gets more use in cad software than any other button and not even minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where can not continue to work 
positive,great sound and battery life price is also right 
positive,easy to set up and use like the slim design 
neutral,the enter and backslash keys are not in the traditional locations too bad because really liked the travel of the keys 
neutral,battery last about hrs

positive,super speaker love it 
positive,excellent my year old god daughter used it for school she said it was fantastic

neutral,haven had them that long maybe couple of months and the sound has went out on one of the headphones
positive,sleek and very kewl low profile and easy on the hands very satisfied with my product 
neutral,bought this for work and three hours after turning it on the mouse wheel broke and became unusable 
positive,this is by far one of the best headsets have ever purchased the sound quality is great and noise cancellation is amazing you can beat the price either great company to work with recommend 
positive,my sony bluetooth speaker gave out replaced it with this unit and love it good volume and bass good enough for my and rock and roll taste 
positive,love this mouse its lightweight and love that its usb charge great value for the price 
positive,it sooo pretty and very easy to use just as described online highly recommend love rose gold 
positive, bought one of these from this company and it stopped working within the first weeks messaged the seller upset because could not return thought maybe buying the upgraded version would be best option before making large complaint because it was nice mouse for the little time was able to use it big mistake the second one stopped working within weeks of using it continuously can return if either to receive my money back or receive replacement it frustrating because of the fact that work from home and need mouse am going to make complaint through amazon itself but wanted to warn others not to waist your money good luck 
positive,it was easy to setup the mouse works perfectly and absolutely love the color change lighting 
negative,i had this mouse before without the led lights worked like charm but despite this version that says the led lights are able to turn off they don the switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work the on button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights so basically stuck with annoying flashing lights 
positive,very reactive but not quite membrane and not as quiet as they claim took minute to get used to how loud the space bar especially was but love the colors and how quick it wakes sleeps holds long charge and recharges quickly have carpal tunnels and this is easier on my hands than even my macbook air ergonomic and reactive granted its not wake the family loud or anything but far from silent my favorite keyboard ever nevertheless 
positive,bluetooth won pair but it works fine with an aux cable 
positive,i like that this mouse is rechargeable feels weird in my hand and doesn move as fast as expect
neutral,it didn work at all with my playstation 
positive,the title of my post says lot also like how lightweight it is it very responsive to movement but not overly so it as good wireless mouse as ve ever had 
positive,this product was definitely worth the money it equipped with every function desirable for wireless mouse being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally the rgb lights were nice as well 
neutral,the mouse doesn work now and am outside the return window disappointed beasue like the feel of the mouse and the sleek design
positive,this item is very good haven used it enough to determine the capacity of the battery but happy with it so far 
positive,purchased this headset for my son and he loves it the sound is very good and it also cancels the noise pretty well works well with our ps also worth mentioning it is very soft and comfortable would definitely recommend 
positive,clicking the right and left stick and it is slow to catch click cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for cute yes but not worth the frustration 
neutral,product will not charge tried multiple outlets boxes cords product turns on for seconds has red light then shuts off junk 
negative,don waste your money stopped working after days of use doesn hold charger either 
negative,order my fourth pair all three pair of blue ones head phone jack has shortage in them once take them out the box and cause sound to go in and out the last pair order returned for another pair and just got them yesterday and they are doing the same thing so going to return them for my money back think it is bad business 
neutral,we re very happy with headset except it stopped working after only months which was very disappointing 
positive,love the feel of it with my hand and the fact it doesn need to be charged every week went over week and half before had to charge it 
positive,i don like the fact that the mike doesn pick up voice very well its about half the reason why bought it the overall construction is not very sturdy the plastic is brittle the leds work as advertised but it takes an entire usb port so you need three open ports on the front of the pc just to have the headphones work with features the headphones themselves are uncomfortable and not better than the cheap headset was using before the audio quality isn great pros they look cool but that about it don pay full price for these glad didn 
negative,received speaker in april am having problems with the battery not lasting put battery charging and it doesn go any further than bars gets stuck on th bar blinking not sure what is the next step 
positive,bought this for my husband for father day he loves it

positive,i am not gamer but love the keyboards that light up and change color finally needed new keyboard for work so ordered this one since it was such great price and am not fancy keyboard person curved piece etc and love this keyboard am probably going to buy second one for home this is perfect for me super happy with my purchase and super fast shipping stars plus 
neutral,stopped working within the first week of use
positive,i like the looks feel and sounds of these headphones the cable could be longer and longer cable separation of the input usb and the ear jack would be an improvement the volume control is mispositioned for tall user as it gets in the way and is heavy on the cord otherwise these things are great and do highly recommend them 
neutral,skip it
positive,i am going to use this product to record youtube videos amazing headset comfy pretty much noice cancelling nice sound quality and decent mic 
neutral,you can get sound only on mac microphone is not supported 
negative,do not recommend just purchased in june and it already broken in august 
neutral,not battery operated since it led the charge lasts less than month with the tiny charging wire you can use while charging useless junk 
neutral,i bought this because the keyboard on my daughter asus gaming laptop kept having problems with the keys popping off this is working well for now and she enjoys the light up feature 
positive,love it great value
positive,the major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent it lasts only about hours for me guessing the one got may be defective because need to have this plugged in all the time to make it usable but can work that way not factoring in the battery everything else is great in comparison to other mice in this price range

positive,it exceeded my expectation we love it and could practically take it with us whenever we travel 
positive,very chic and love the way it lights up it has two settings either leave the lights totally on or have them cut on as you tap on the buttons works wonderful and have only had to charge it one time since ve had the mouse 
positive,i really enjoy the feel of the mouse it slick which has put less strain on my wrist but ll still be getting wrist support the colors don need to be turned on and when left in middle it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath 
positive,i love the colors it feels great on your head and the audio is perfect mic is great and not too close to mouth love it
positive,love it this mouse is very sleek and thin 
positive,i love this little mouse it so small and sleek and fits in my hand nicely it moves quickly use several screens at work and it moves from to another without any problem and it fun that it lights up too

neutral,good for the price 
positive,love this product comfort noise cancellation great for gaming
positive,purchased for my gaming teenager he loves it 
positive,control shift doesn work saw this in other older reviews but this was supposed to be new version of the keyboard so hoped it was fixed nope before all the other features backlighting ergonomics etc keyboard needs to allow you to press keys and have those keys go to the computer use this combo constantly for work to login to sites as different users or without cookies not taking what type and send it to the computer is non starter for me even if you don use this combo lot there might be other combos that don work and just out of principal don think it good idea to support product that doesn actually allow you to type something and have it go to the computer 
negative,works about of the time making it more frustrating than if it was literally useless paperweight doesn work as mouse though 
neutral,this mouse is ridiculously cheap do not buy garbage 
positive,i love the colors for the headset it works like charm

neutral,worked for couple months doesn anymore
neutral,it broke from one say to the next sad cause it was cute and very handy but the product just didn last long at all 
positive,great sound and battery life
neutral,the product was toy junk false advertisment
positive,sleep mode helps the charge last longer and it great for the wrist 
positive,this headset does exactly what it advertises good sound ok noise cancelation and its great for gaming
positive, wanted to find very nice and stylish mouse and ran across this one it was so very easy to connect to my laptop and very lightweight love the colorful light display ve been using the wireless mouse for few days and it appears to hold good charge you can go wrong with this charger and the price was very reasonable compared to other brands with the same capabilities 
neutral,this keyboards has decent design however it disconnects very often it completely useless if can use it 
positive,works fine compact and charged in flash would definitely recommend really like the led light 
positive,the keyboard does say wireless but if do not have it plugged into the usb port it will not work they replaced it immediately with keyboard that works correctly thank you 
neutral,the extensions are not quite long enough and they are little tight 
neutral,stopped working after couple of weeks
negative,this was horrible purchase am returning this because it sucked 
negative,the speaker came charged but would never charge again thankful the initial charge lasted so long didn even notice it was defective until after the return window huge waste of money 
positive,love this mouse for my laptop glad chose this one not only is it comfortable slim and sleek in my palm but love the rotating fun colors that it emits which can also be turned off for the single color mode 
positive,bought this for my yr old very comfortable nice design he uses it for virtual learning and gaming we have not yet tried noise cancellation however my teen has game headphone diff brand and he cam hear all background noise of my yr olds headphones 
neutral,i ve had this device for about months brought for my kids distance learning no issues so far charge the device at least once week
positive,great product work ls like described xbox one never sounded so good 
positive,works great and the sound is awesome 
positive,the keyboard feels good when typing it accurate the backlight is good touch is good touch and allows for typing in dark places the size is good my only complain is that the keyboard is not silent at all even though it advertises being so unless you do words per minute then you won be typing silently 
neutral,i love this mouse its quiet modern and the lights are nice added touch pro tip remember to store the usb connector under the mouse when not in use have lost mine or damaged it in the past 
neutral,be ready to turn it on and off every mins of non use the thing goes into sleep mode then is sluggish in its response time till you restart it not something would reccomend
positive,the sound is great and it very easy for old people to use 
neutral,sensitive mouse maybe because it new works fine
neutral,perfect for filling space with sound and blocking out ambient noise 
positive,have been using the wireless mouse now for few months and it is great purchase after charging it works for days also the speed is fantastic would highly recommend buying item 
negative,i used this mouse for laptop it slowly stopped holding charge disappointed and happened after return item window closed 
neutral,no complaint 
neutral,bought as an upgrade for my flip same volume level maybe tad more bass and battery life returned item and kept flip 
neutral,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on so in all the charging feature does not work it was cute mouse though but it doesn work 
positive,like the size and ease of using it to travel with took it to broken bow and it worked great on the outdoor patio sound does break up some the more bass you have it really depends on what room you are in for the sound of this thing some environments are better then other easy connectivity and we have enjoyed it would recommend it 
positive,i pretty happy with this keyboard except for one thing the enter key spans two lines and the pipe button is moved down line this small feature really slows down my typing especially in unix environment just can seem to get past that hopefully in time will but switching between keyboards will likely be an issue other than that they key board lights up nice holds charge is fairly easy to type on wish the keys were like bigger and haven tried swimming with it so can speak to the water proof part can exchange it because already recycled the box ll make it work for now 
neutral,stopped working for no apparent reason
positive,i purchased for my kids to use while doing online class work it was easy to set up and seems to work well was hoping for something that felt more sturdy it feels very cheap the kids love the changing lights while they use the mouse my only complaint is that if they don remember to turn off the noise after use then it dies and has to be recharged before if can be used again
neutral,this mouse is not bluetooth compatible usb only
neutral,stop working the wheel just stopped working just rolled and rolled
positive,i bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them they are nice size not too bulky and the quality is good for the price 
positive,someone gave me charge bought charge thinking could pair them nope so bought another charge pairing is difficult if you desire stereo sound as opposed to two mono speakers had to get second jbl app and attempt to import my music into it some of which won play when do get it to play in stereo it doesn stay that way for long the hardware software combo has been finicky and temperamental for me also amazon is not letting me add an informative photo 
positive,this mouse was so cute and easy to use love the colors but after two months it won connect to my computer it sometimes lights up but not consistently and my computer doesn recognize it 
positive,i really love the long battery life of this mouse was wandering before buying this stuff but once got it didn wanted to go back to other mouse even suggested my friends to buy and they are happy with the purchase
negative,i purchased this for my mom and once the battery went dead it would not recharge 
negative,rechargeable comfortable haven killed it yet use it at work haven killed the battery but charge it overnight lasts the day for me
neutral,only last months before it quit working
positive,best purchase
neutral,only used times before they stopped working
positive,i loved my first one gave it away to friend and ordered another using the amazon buy again the next one was about inches bigger in length and about an inch larger in diameter seems like they shouldn have called it replacement 
neutral,when got it was excited for the usb charging and the cool lights but this mouse has been lot of trouble it will lose connection easily and ll have to click or times sometimes before actually clicking on what want 
neutral,so far so good was suppose to be christmas present for my son however it came boxed with lb bag of dog food and keyboard box was smashed also the seal was cut open so had to have my son make sure everything worked not much of present surprise but at least it works so far 
neutral,loved this mouse at first had zero problems with it however now it will not stay on it has charged over night but as soon as take it off the charger to use it it dies it will not turn on and am not able to use it guess you get what you pay for 
positive,although we had quality issue with one of the laces the vendor fixed our problem and replaced the damaged laces happy to give it another shot and hope we have better luck this time 
neutral,it works very well the only thing is cannot get the led lights to light up 
neutral,it cute pink is just like the picture it really nice mouse but sad that it doesn work with my ipad put photos of the manual and it says that mouse needs usb port to operate think that black usb goes into computer and communicates with the one beneath the mouse 
positive,yep works excellent love it would not trade it for nothing
neutral,the center scroll wheel lasted less than week the mouse itself still works but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with wheel that doesn work decent battery life bought new different brand mouse to replace it the mouse also doesn have much of an arch to it so its not very ergonomic its better than laptop track pad though 
neutral,easy to charge with usb cable lasts longer
positive,this is awesome
positive,the mouse arrived today easy to set up so far it is working properly like the fact that it rechargeable no more aa battery to replace ll have to get use to its size lot shorter than my old morosoft mouse hope it lasts as long as the old mouse time will tell 
positive,this mouse is cute and convenient not heavy the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet works fine with my macbook air the only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with is very hard to insert it into the port that it comes but besides that everything works fine 
positive,the sound is really good it connects to bluetooth quickly and is extremely portable love it and recommend it 
positive,super quality sound perfect for relaxing and enjoying music in the confines of home great value for money 
positive,so far this holds decent charge and its really nice for my wah job that requires tons of typing the space bar makes weird squeaking noise but other than that love this 
neutral,i only had this speaker for less than year and it stopped charging this is my second and last jbl speaker am staying with bose for now on 
positive,it perfect 
neutral,every time use the mouse there is this high pitched noise hurts my ears
positive,sound quality is great we bought this for the pool and the boat it plenty loud and battery stay charged for hours 
neutral,just right for when working at night and not wanting to turn extra lights on 
positive,woke awesome very loud
neutral,i guess you get what you paid for the mouse will not stay charged and will not connect with my ipad super disappointed 
neutral,this product has to be plugged into the xbox and controller at the sametime to work it has about inches of cord making it impossible to play any games 
neutral,it gets the job done
positive,great for the kids 
neutral,the cord is way too long it and it gets tangled up because it is so long and sometimes it cuts out so can only hear in one ear and have to fiddle with the cord to try and fix it the mic cancels most noise but the headset does not cancel any noise and since have fan on can hear it with my headset on and it gets annoying while trying to game 
positive,the keyboard is quiet and the backlight is really nice the keyboard is functioning correctly as am typing the review right now however the design itself has some problems if were to describe the feeling of typing on it it feels somewhat sticky as though am typing into quicksand this is likely because for the design to be quiet it blunts the speed of key pressing and returning to its original position honestly wouldn have minded the noise if it meant better typing experience as it feels like actually expending effort to type each key the charger port also has issues with the male usb cable plugging in it has lots of resistance and only goes in like mm with exposed metal when the charge is active all in all think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is godsend but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction 
positive,i had slight issue and was sent new keyboard with express shipping turned out the original keyboard worked after all great customer support 
negative,this mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and half at two weeks it seemed to glitch the cursor would jerk and freeze so connected the mouse to the charger it was ok for couple of days but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon very cheaply made product maybe those star reviews are bought very disappointing 
positive,really awesome speaker
positive,everything is perfect except that had to chip little bit off of the plugging that goes on the controller bcus it would fit right on my ps controllers
positive, don use the color changing feature so with that the battery life lasts really long time say that because purchased this may and my battery just now needs charged december and use this days week for work hours day love this product no noise sleek comfortable just love it worth it hands down 
positive,this is great mouse quiet responsive fun color 
neutral,i have held back writing review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after while it has not been the case for me have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact would recommend the mouse 
positive,super load and light fits in every bag worth every penny
positive,it would sometimes require extra force to register the click so definitely don recommend it for gaming the optics worked very well so it definitely good normal use mouse 
positive,my favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch the colors are great addition and add to the experience of using it it feels sleek as you move it on mousepad and all other surfaces and textures the customer service has been splendid they replaced mouse for me and helped answer questions when inquired about getting replacement usb receiver they were pleasure to communicate with no complaints
neutral,very loud for such small speaker clear sound 
positive,great product have nothing bad to say about this product worth every penny 
neutral,typing no longer sounds extremely loud or distracting it is smooth and perfect for gaming as well 
neutral,this product broke in days
positive,overall really like the mouse but the scroll button doesn work also was not able to find way to contact the seller to resolve the issue 
neutral,very good speaker
neutral,i really liked this mouse very convenienthowever bought it less that months ago and the wheel stopped workingvery disappointed
positive,great product 
neutral,tried these for the first time and mic doesn work will be returning 
positive,this mouse feel different from others used it light comfortable and easy to control my hand doesn have stretch pain after using this mouse at work for whole shift not light the old one 
positive,i really liked this headset the mic is working really great and it feels really comfortable 
positive,i purchased this mouse back in june of this year it is now october the battery life is soo powerful the color changing is the best experience could have ha with mouse can believe how happy am with this purchase 
neutral,used these headphones while playing on the ps did stream to test out how sound to other it was basically at whisper even when was raising my voice same problem when tested the mic using my phone the sound output is also low raised my ps headphone volume and it wasn any louder then the headphones was using before at lower volume the wheel didn help in either of these situations 
positive,i was skeptical at first that such small ergonomic mouse would work pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged highly recommend this mouse and plan on buying another to have as backup for when forget to charge really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun 
neutral,despite the description saying it was macbook compatible it wasn have the macbook air with the chip regardless it nice mouse and it quite as described and does work on pc was able to test it on my pc 
neutral,lasted barely two weeks wire disconnected from the prong lights don work needed cheap set well got it 
positive,this mouse is awesome it charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new apple mac plug thing hated my other dell mouse and this one is so smooth quick to react and quiet never thought it would make difference but my students can not hear my annoying clicking anymore recommend 
positive,the back lighting is great it still bit stiff compared to my old one but getting used to it highly recommend it lots of bang for the buck 
neutral,good mouse
positive,great for the price sounds awesome 
neutral,scroll wheel on off switch broke without much use it was good while it lasted but nothing too special mainly liked the shape
neutral,for gaming
positive,one of the best gaming headsets ve come across so far ve already tested other models from this brand 
positive,the keyboard is great work from home in my son bedroom so in the mornings and during nap time work in complete darkness the keyboards brightness is perfect as don have to adjust the monitor brightness too high the fact that it is rechargeable with type makes it ideal as can charge my phone as well so far ve gone days without having to charge the keyboard am excel shortcut junkie and have had no issues looking forward to continue using the keyboard 
neutral,light never turned on came dirty
positive,so teach prek and we have nap time what caught my attention was the quiet clicker didn think it would be as quiet as it is but it is extremely quiet it also easy to set up and easy to use 
positive,this product came as indicated the packaging was great no tape waste the headphone jack couldn fit into mu phone with the case on but that an easy fix so far sound is good haven tried the mic yet overall good headset for the price 
neutral,waaay to light flies off desk at angular touch and there is nowhere to grip if and when you want to move it without touching key and messing up processes 
neutral,i like it cause it is quiet 
positive,fantastic 
positive,i have to admit that am extremely pleased with this keyboard do game from time to time and it has performed exactly as expected mainly got the keyboard for coding though and it is the main reason now stay up much later at night to get the job done it is without doubt the best keyboard have ever owned the backlighting is superb and have yet to experience any strain from typing for prolonged periods of time it is very lightweight and robust and has already survived few water spills if you have kids rest assured that the keyboard can survive even their attention in nutshell then it is way better than expected for the price 
neutral,the item would charge but then would not turn on or work at all in the computer
neutral,it not the worst and it certainly not the best but overall think that it was bit too expensive for its quality it it supper uncomfortable the mic is supper quiet and there is no way to turn it up overall highly recommend getting turtle beach headset 
positive,now that an old man and don need anything super fancy for my desktop replaced deathadder from with it only been using it for about hours but no major complaints so far takes little bit of getting use to because it sits so low but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive 
positive,works well he loves the lights 
neutral,got of these they work really well but it has to be plugged into the usb in order for it to light up which is stupid you can use them on controller without also plugging the usb into something else but great for pc 
neutral,lasted months of light use before it would no longer turn on keys had already started sticking 
neutral,worked for very few days then crapped out all together my bad for buying bargain keyboard ll stick with logitech from now on 
neutral,mic quality is terrible people can hardly hear me through it
positive,so really like it like you can shut of the lights if you want it is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it very easy for person who has laptop 
positive,the product is good but if you have big ears like me recommend bigger ear muffs like runmus k
negative,it was sleek and nice looking mouse but the usb got annoying and broke easily
neutral,product did not move smoothly across the mouse pad and did not fit my hand particularly well 
positive,have been using it nonstop since got it the look of the keyboard is super sleek and nice love the colors and the auto shut off of the lights when not being used has type charger so it works great with your phone charger if you have an android phone keys do not make noise which is nice connected quickly to my laptop no problems at all wish the company would make wireless mouse to go with this keyboard though 
neutral,clicking this mouse takes so much force have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it and if ever pick the mouse up off the pad my cursor moves erratically around even if it pointed at the ceiling literally the most important things for mouse pointing and clicking are useless on this thing looks nice though 
neutral,function well at work still 
neutral,loudness good
positive,these headphones are worth the money clear and durable they get dropped lot will definitely buy again 
positive,this is not for an adult hand this is better suited for child hand it also does pretty quickly it very uncomfortable to use and totally not worth it even at the lightning price bought it at 
negative,its pretty but the charge doesn last long plug it in to my laptop to charge but the laptop shuts down after few minutes and the mouse quits charging there is short charging cord but no adaptor to plug it into the wall and it says not to use cell phone charging adaptors so recharging was pain 
positive,i like it worth the money 
neutral,the wheel button broke as it was simply built with thin plastic rod sent it back hard pass 
positive,it puts out great sound easy to connect with battery life is great it is really hard to say anything bad about this speaker well worth the price 
neutral,thy send me jbl with out charger paid for it don understand sending something very expensive with out of charger
neutral,loved it as long as it worked stopped working yesterday even tried charging it again but it wouldn even do that with only month to return if not working am out mouse and must buy another one too bad as really did like this model now onto shopping 
neutral,good mouse foe every day use
positive,great headset exactly as listed 
positive,these headphones are amazing especially for the price the cable is long and the braids make it tough the headphones itself are pretty comfortable and the sound quality is really good also really like the fact that there is switch to mute the microphone and volume controls right on the cable great gaming headset at an affordable price 
positive,great little mouse light weight and love the colorful lights and can turn off when not using to save charging power 
positive, love it plug in and go works on my work computer with no problem will purchase from them again
positive,works very well charges good love it
neutral,the mouse is so smooth and responsive when it died it wouldn take charge so is now useless about what expected for being so cheap pretty color though 
positive,i like the silent clicking and the smoothness and the ergonomic design but the wheel doesn scroll anything on the computer the wheel will move but won scroll anything on the screen 
neutral,could not have been wrong in ordering this speaker
positive,i wrote negative review for this purchase company reached out to me and offered replacement free of charge while really appreciate the replacement found the new set of headphones had the same issue as the original choppy sound is not an ideal way to immerse yourself into game truly appreciate the company effort but can recommend this product 
positive,great for distance learning
neutral,it became sluggish and wasnt working properly with my mac after month or so 
positive,perfect portable speaker for your back yard going on trips the sound is great 
positive,this was great mouse for schoolwork and better then using battery mouse
neutral,it ok
positive,we first purchased this in december for my then year old he absolutely loved it after almost years of steady regular usage it was still holding up just fine then we got puppy who decided she liked the cords better for herself than the child when asked what kind of replacement he wanted he said the exact same one have had and so we purchased second one 
neutral,does not work with xbox 
positive,i went through lot of wireless keyboards but this on is right on top of themthe lights are nice and non intrusive the battery life is long and the keys are quiet very nice keyboard for gaming and anything in between 
positive,use this for my laptop and easy to use and works great very smooth would definitely recommend 
negative,mouse never worked with usb adapter flashes once red and never connects clearly cheap construction and plastic not even sure it charges properly glows blue briefly and then turns back off 
neutral,yes would
positive,i been looking to upgrade from my old headset these are everything been looking for they re comfortable and the sound quality is fantastic 
neutral,when plug the usb into the computer it takes away my internet settings cannot connect to the internet and it shows no networks to connect to don know how to fix it 
negative,i really like the feel and look of this mouse don like that anytime stop using the mouse for minute or two that the mouse doesn react end up turning it off and on again to get it working interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time stop using it edit today is day of using the mouse while wait to receive the other mouse bought the mouse no longer consistently turns on when turn it off and on again to stop it from lagging 
positive,i have been looking for wireless keyboard with back light and came across this one am really enjoying it no am not gamer am using this for work like the lights on the keyboard it really light weight and it does not take up lot of space the only issue is one of the shift key is loose but it not that bad to point where it needs to be returned for me that just my opinion the keyboard only lights up when it in use then after few minutes it goes into sleep mode and that not issue for me 
neutral,my son brought his speaker over to listen to while he did some outdoor work for me after listened had to get one for myself 
neutral,works well 
positive,works great 
neutral,it stop working within weeks 
neutral,loud and long lasting use it at work and it it plenty loud enough
negative,after receiving this mouse charged the mouse per the instructions on normal rate usb charger non fast charger this took little under two hours for full charge the blue light goes out when fully charged installed the usb receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on windows the mouse seems to work smoothly and the mouse pointer is swift you can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast the mouse lights up around the sides when in use it is bit quirky but it doesn bother me also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for certain period of time probably to prolong the battery charge to wake the mouse just move it or press button overall it is decent wireless rechargeable mouse 
neutral,is sucks don get it
negative,my wife complains about how it charges sometimes it doesn get full charge that might have more to do with how she goes about it though one concern to be aware of though is how the watertight flap can pinch the charging connection she puts another usb cable into the out port to keep the flap off of the usb in
neutral,battery life is horrible on this mouse won last more than minutes thought it was fluke and got replacement because the mouse is comfortable and cool looking but the second one they sent me was even worse with whopping minute battery life after full charge 
positive,very nice bought love it 
negative,the sound for the head set is ok but not good or amazing in any way it hard to hear the people talk sometimes it sounds like they re far away or something it is also heavy on the cable side it feels clunky dealing with it
positive,awesome headset comfortable to wear noise cancellation is great wasn expecting it to be as good above expectations for the price 
positive,just got the headset so far it sounds great 
neutral,i could not pair the mouse to my macbook air really don know why 
neutral,this is exactly what was looking for streamlined quiet and rechargeable 
neutral,don spend your money on this crap
positive,i bought this product months ago the wireless had good range you can use it while charging color led looks good during night time simple and handy fast charging on off buttons worth for money 
neutral,everything expected
positive,i got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap it really feels like its made of trash it does seem to work well enough though the tracking is inconsistent at best the ergonomics are really non existent doesn seem like it made for human hands overall if you re buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it but if you actually care about having half decent mouse skip this one 
positive,it very comfortable on your ears and it doesn add any static the sound control is very good and the mic works very well 
neutral, mouse stopped working had it worked for couple of days 
negative,ugh can return since outside my return window stopped working 
negative,the mouse itself still works but the usb port has just broken in million pieces my laptop stays at home and it is what use as my home computer after about month of use the usb port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone one more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or will be unable to use the mouse 
positive,i use this guy all day every literally work in remodel and have it playing from and then use it at the weekend to for grilling out on the boat or riding my bike sound is great good bass for little guy and gets loud enough for what you need from speaker this size easy to charge and last long time only wish it would tell you when the battery was low with noise and not just die on me 
positive,very skeptical at the beginning did lots of research on competitors let be honest this is not going to replace total sound system if that what you are dreaming of but this speaker goes from room to room and outside and gives sound that is of high enough quality for you not to feel like you are missing out on something better bought this for family member first saw how good it was then bought one for myself within the same week battery life is great would definitely recommend this 
neutral,usb is not compatible with the usb port of laptop or desktop 
negative,this speaker completely stopped charging after less than months terribly disappointed
neutral,it okay not quiet at all
positive,love it battery life is awesome as is sound quality thought about buying something bigger especially for the price but glad we didn 
positive,just what expected better than most cheap under portable bluetooth speakers as far as sound quality goes its just ok honestly was hoping it had better sound quality but it doesnt but for portable battery powered bluetooth speakers it meets expectations for the price low frequencies bass is ok mid frequencies are ok and high frequencies treble are also just ok would have preferred they made it not waterproof and had better sound quality don really care if it waterproof or not especially if that feature is going to sacrifice the sound quality
positive,got this unit on sale and paired it with my ipad worked great 
neutral, have been using this item for over week this has change my gaming little bit would say good value for price if you re looking for gaming headphone for cheap price look no further guys 
neutral,i was looking at this mouse when my cat jumped on my lap and hit the buy now button turned out to be pretty good mouse true story but she can write reviews so she may be little disappointed
neutral,stopped working month after received this
neutral,the better bass sound
positive, months and already not holding charge my jbl had same issue but after yrs not months very frustrating
positive,bought these for my son in place of his old xbox headset he loves these

neutral,very nice headset especially for the price 
positive,not bad rechargeable and portable highly recommend
positive,to me personally this item looks so however bought it for friend and she says it works perfectly and makes her desk area look alive 
positive,perfect for gaming fits my year old perfect 
positive,is almost tiny for my hands and very light works so good and decently priced ll learn to use it for surfing the web yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle think holding it in the past ve had taller models that have flair formed to keep the fingers in position in construction using stuff that requires good grip makes this like using feather barely feel makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make lot fast moves elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good may even make flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down it is cool with the lights no joke good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control lol yet thank you found another fun product on amazon again 
neutral,i like that when you don use it cuts off for you and it long lasting when charged
positive,daughter my love them she doesn have to hear my while doing either thing lol
positive,this keyboard is good inexpensive wireless keyboard the colors are nice and bright with button for adjusting the brightness you can also turn the rgb off all together the battery life is very good usually get around days of battery life without ever turning it off and heavy use it not mechanical keyboard so if you re purist would stay away from it but for normal life use it great 
neutral,bought it after going through many water proof keyboards am clumsy so this got wet but after letting it dry completely it works again with no issues had some issues with the st one bought cause it would no longer sync with pc but talked with tech support they sent another and it has not had any issues 
neutral,i thought this mouse was really cool but then it broke the scrolly wheel thing doesnt move anymore it lasted like week and its not my main computer so it didnt get used much in that week

positive,works great
neutral,all good
positive,i love the speaker and have one already in this case had to get one for friend with amzn for specific reason but the price charged is grossly over priced could have gotten one at walmart for all day long but had to use amzn for friend why does amzn allow this level of gouging other wise perfect speaker for my purposes 
positive,i very happy with the keyboard got it was well packaged and is very easy to use do enjoy the minimal sound and the texture of the keys the only key that is bit harsh on the fingers in the space bar but the rest is very nice and smooth the lights go off whenever the keyboard is not in use 
positive,this gives amazing sound the bass is clear heavy sound and the treble is crisp and sharp the volume is amazing too could fill room or patio the battery life is great many hours per charge the fact that it waterproof is an added bonus also my phone found it immediately no messing around or effort needed great buy for the price 
neutral,stops working even when it fully charged 
positive,my husband enjoys movies however his taste and my taste aren the same since getting these headphones we can be in the same room with him enjoying movie on his laptop while watching movie on tv my husband says the sound quality of these headphones is good as far as noise cancelling he says that some background noise does creep in but not enough to interfere with whatever movie he watching pleased with these headphones and will probably buy another pair for my grandson 
positive,i have flip and this charge ive played both and im little disappointed with the charge my flip has stereo speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge its weird the flip sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume where the charge doesn sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sibling flip the only thing consider the charge to have over the flip is it doesn get too distorted at max volume like the flip but the flip just sounds great almost at any level but at max maybe little less bass on the flip too but not by much im beginning to regret my charge purchase wish just went with new flip and see how that works out btw used the charge for hotel room bluetooth soundbar since live in hotels while working each month so good sound means lot to me especially when get noise complaints from the host 
positive,i use this speaker around the house and love it the sound and the quality is excellent this speaker was everything expected it to be

neutral,i ve had this wireless mouse less than month and the wheel of the mouse has already broke not to happy with this mouse won buy this again
positive,i bought bought it as gift for my husband but use it sometimes it not too loud very portable he loved that we take it to the beach with us every time we go easily connects to bluetooth the battery last very good while my only dislike was that when vacuum doesn play loud enough to hear it over the noise of my vacuum 
neutral,plenty loud to play music in my garage while workout with the door open no need to spend more for bigger speaker 
neutral,didn work 
neutral,repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight searched for power issue reviews and found am not the only one cannot recommend this product and feel it should be taken down due to this 
negative,very well made for sound and mic but kind of hurts your head after long period if you have big ears 
positive,love the mouse itself however charging wire is too short
positive,they fit well came fast and are durable

positive,amazing customer service had an issue with the st pair of head phones was happy with the sound quality and production value of the headphones however the set received was very tight against my ears causing them to hurt after only an hour our two posted review of my experience and bengoo representative reached out to me they sent brand new pair at no additional expense and am very happy with my new set they fit properly and are very comfortable they have great dynamic sound primarily use these for online gaming and am able to clearly identify if sneaking up behind me the mic is very clear and cancels out background noise very well would highly recommend this product both for the quality and the amazing customer service

positive,my grandson talked me into this purchase and have to say am enjoying it sound is pretty good for portable small speaker battery life is good so far can usually get about days of from morning till night out of full charge feel satisfied with the charge purchases 
positive,i was on the fence about purchasing portable speaker as typically underwhelmed with the sound quality but this dig out of the box it was lacking little but after eqing with my phone it is punchy and exactly what am looking for large enough to carry the tech needed to produce quality sound small enough to carry around or even throw in my bicycle bag to listen while riding not much can complain about here if save up the cash might buy second one to get stereo sound but haven honestly missed it that much buy one 
positive,great feel full size keyboard that is wireless and has blacklighting bought this because several keys quit working on my laptop don really use this for gaming but love size and the feel of the keystrokes it also has built in battery so you can just recharge instead of having to replace batteries all the time very happy with this purchase

positive,this mouse is wonderful to use for precise things such as line drawing and making flow charts it is super comfortable to use unfortunately bought this at the beginning of the year and now it will not charge so basically now have corded mouse which is what needed to avoid so until find highly rated cordless or battery operated one will be tied to the computer literally

neutral,like the size
positive,i have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with did not charge then tried multiple cables and power sources already owned still did not charge left it plugged in for hours while was away from home come home to an uncharged mouse the blue light stays on for about seconds before shutting off the design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse would recommend spending bit more on quality mouse that can serve its purpose 
neutral,you get what you pay for this thing is piece of crap 
neutral,not functional for gaming if the charge doesn last 
neutral,the good thing is this mouse is cheap but it feels like it too the wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should

neutral,i love this mouse the only reason gave it star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite when scroll forward away from me the page goes down and when scroll backwards towards me the page goes up getting used to it but rather it just be like normal mouse is there any way to fix this or does anyone else have this problem 
positive,great speaker so loud and the sound is beautiful

positive,i loved this mouse for all of one month it connected and worked perfectly however after one month of relatively light use the scrolling wheel stopped working of course this happened right after the return window closed now back to square one 
neutral,after owning for less than months the battery will not charge what crock of 
neutral,could be brighter only star due to inadequate user guide 
positive,the product was great received exactly what was advertised such as noise cancellation the quality of audio is superb and would definitely recommend to anyone looking the better their gaming experience 
neutral,was when purchased it now glad took it early 
positive,i was impressed they sound really good wish it didn have the usb plug for the lights but not big deal 
neutral,battery life is good drive trucks with hr shift charge it every days 
positive,i purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when was using it it looked exactly like the mouse in the picture and was easy to charge and use it also held charge for long time which was really happy about the reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for months and then it completely stopped working no matter what did certainly wasn expecting wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least months out of it before it died if you re looking for something cute and short term and don mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you 
positive,this is cool wireless gaming keyboard love the fact that it lights up however it has an internal battery that needs to be charged too often 
positive,great speaker
neutral,you get what you paid for this headset probably is good for gaming but bought it to use for my work video conferences and people complain about the quality of my voice over microsoft teams will need to get higher quality headset edit the seller contacted me with an offer of gift card if remove my review 
positive,if your looking for wireless gaming keyboard that won set you back few hundred bucks this is the keyboard for you honestly was expecting piece of junk for the price but also didn want to spend bunch on an expensive gaming keyboard as im not an avid player this keyboard is quiet easy to set up and boy its cheap even if you dont like it you can always give it to someone and they probably would appreciate it 
positive,was so excited for this mouse loved the style and lights when ordered it once received it used it for approx half day and then it died and never turned back on charged it through the pc for quite while when realized it hadnt charged tried wall outlet never turned back on went through some of the reviews after and realized it was running theme and that many other customers had the same experience dont waste your time 
neutral,i bought it for my husband for his job he works on pipeline and it definitely loud enough to hear it 
negative,i used this mouse once after this use it died so was going to charge it up figuring didn give it enough time to charge tried different times and it wouldn charge at all so decided to just go back to my old mouse tried to remove the usb and the metal part broke off and stayed inside my laptop so had to remove it and there was no fixing it so disappointed in the quality of this mouse 
positive,really cool looking headset great quality sound too definitely worth my money 
positive,tested this out after charging it so far so good 
negative, update after using the mouse for around days it just completely stopped working the lights come on and it appears to charge but the buttons no longer work and the optical lens doesn pick up any movement don even bother with this it trash not very reliable mouse after just couple days of use it stops working intermittently which is frustrating wouldn purchase again that said it is very quiet mouse with no audible click and it good size 
positive,thay sound great
positive,this product was little disappointing to be honest for one wish had paid attention to the fact that this is not wireless second the lights don come on with mic jack which sure it wouldn make sense to but it really should have just been usb with an adaptor otherwise if you don care about lights it works fine say it better suited for pc gaming since usually there mic jack next to usb port but not for consoles its not the worst just the sound quality is kind of minimal it doesn play music too well it can get loud but then the sound gets shrill amd will induce headach truthfully wouldn buy this again 
neutral,some standard hotkeys don work with the left shift button disappointed but want to like this keyboard the company refunded me then ordered another one cause it neat keyboard and hoped the problem was fluke nope same problem on the second one specifically ctrl left shift any of the following u m do not work on this keyboard if you normally use ctrl right shift any key suppose you won notice problem but for me first noticed it trying to select inverse in photoshop ctrl shift and found the other problems using keyboard ghosting tool aside from that problem like this keyboard but it really touts anti ghosting stuff so did not expect this kind of problem it might not seem like big deal but it easier for me to just use different keyboard than re learn decades old muscle memory and who knows what other key combinations are faulty 
positive,great for the price 
negative,it broke literally less than month and ive never even dropped it super disappointed and waste of money 
neutral,nice that you can carry with you the mouse along with its usb key
neutral,the usb is only for light it only works via mm jack misleading advertising useless to me sound quality is fine if bit quiet noise cancelation is below average but exactly what you expect for bucks 
neutral,excellent sound good build quality supports aux in annoying feature turns sound off if volume low but acceptable workaround turn up volume on device app is only to connect multiple speakers no other features for me not an issue 
positive,awesome got pair of these for my brothers birthday and he really liked them
positive,as the title suggest it stopped working after week of use really liked the feel and look of the mouse so was pretty happy with it until today when it stopped working do not recommend 
positive,really disappointed with this product loved it when got it it fit my hand nicely worked like dream then it came time to charge it no matter where plugged it in could not get it to charge not sure if it is just faulty product or if this is just how they are 
positive,my other wireless mouse stopped working for some reason and required batteries so had to get another one love that it is rechargable and has the lights the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side thats cool also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny didnt know before buying but it has sleep mode so thats great for if forget to turn it off have to double check the manual but there are switches and dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into usb port to connect to your device honestly like it only other thing is im not sure how know when its dying again may be in the manual
