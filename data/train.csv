sentiments,cleaned_review
positive,absolutely love the sound
neutral,i can hear everything even when my game is on loud do not buy for noise cancelling rated stars for false advertising
positive,pretty solid keyboard quiet and nice feel to it seems to be constructed well 
neutral,i have one and my grandson liked it so got him one for his birthday
positive,i got this to better hear players in ps titles such as vigor apex and dayz it functions far better than my old headphones the sound of my neighborhood is less distracting with the noise cancelation and the headphones fit me much better and more comfortably 
neutral,the roller on top of the mouse quits working or falls down in the mouse the colors and lights are fun but the mouse itself is defective have had at this point and will not buy another 
positive,i bought and we love them
neutral,quality is ok
positive,honestly it far less heavy than would ve liked don feel as though this will be adequate for long term gaming but it ll be alright for web surfing or writing it also fairly small then again have pretty large hands for the price couldn ask for much more but do think it important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is also it does work with macbook air despite the one star reviews you have to connect the receiver to the adapter it takes good bit of force and then plug it into the computer wish the instructions could ve been more clear about that but it whatever 
positive,i was wary of buying no name brand mouse but it turned out to be even better than expected it super sleek and looks great with the leds it also functions very well the clicks are almost silent if you ve used cheap mouse that has loud clicks you ll know what talking about haha and it very reactive use it for light gaming and it perfect haven even had to charge it yet which is amazing absolutely worth it for the price 
negative,battery dies very quickly not impressed sellers keep harassing me to delete my review no way scammers buy the below mouse instead it works great wisfox wireless mouse for laptop ergonomic 
positive,i purchased one of these before and it was really nice like the way it looks and feels it pretty accurate and has good sensitivity and this one got card in it that said get this one for free don know how cuz can read chinese and the instructions are in chinese 
neutral,it good
positive,honestly feels bit on the cheap side and compared to other similar makes the main difference being led lighting so it adds wow factor to it clicking is also smooth and feels nice and the top down view is pleasing the lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than seamless transition performance wise it does the job but ergonomically doesn feel as form fitting as gaming mouse really use this as backup work mouse or home mouse where its just to surf the web also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps first time this has happened on mouse so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price if were to guess the price if seen the product without price tag probably say its about bucks 
positive,good for music and gaming it drowns out everything around you love it
positive,i have bought close to sets of headphones for doing my gaming channel on youtube and these are by far the absolute best finally
neutral,i used it for my school chrome book and all of sudden it fell of my desk and it broke 
neutral,if you are like me and have trouble using usb to usb converters somehow always end up with flaky ones that don maintain connection be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support usb it comes with usb and usb adapter however you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter to use it you cannot use the usb adapter on its own which means have long double adapter sticking out of my computer just waiting to get knocked off had known up front that the usb adapter required the usb adapter to work would not have made this purchase 
negative,it fancy looking keyboard that doesn break your bank rgb lights are well illuminated and keys are ok too keys could be little noisy the biggest problem is you can use the left ctrl and shift buttons together even though the battery life is reasonable the keyboard doesn have proper battery indicator that tells you how much charge left so you might get frustrated when the keyboard suddenly decides to stop in the middle of the work 
positive,probably the best bluetooth speaker on the market for the price paid it slaps af the battery life is wassup still haven dunked it in water but it nice to know that if it does get wet it ll be alright would definitely buy this bad boy again 
positive,it is very nice keyboard the feel is soft yet mechanical battery charge time seems sufficient and the rgb is perfect brightness and at did not expect any color brightness control so that is sufficient in my eyes as well it needs better feeling charging port it does not feel like it connects or goes in all the way the cord is severe charging restriction in other words if you use it to charge phone the phone will charge in slow charge mode but maybe it is on purpose to keep the batteries from overheating suggest making sure to use only that cord for it the keys are little squishy for extended use but over time and use suspect that will wear away and leave light feeling touch which will be decent for gaming and typing 
neutral,scroll button stopped working within weeks
positive,a pretty nice headset for anyone trying to go for one cheap 
positive,i initially wrote bad review about this keyboard thought it stopped working it turns out someone removed the usb receiver from my hub my computer is in dark spot in the basement so didn notice the klim keyboard is awesome great battery life quiet and feels amazing 
positive,comfortable gaming headset to wear and feels very sturdy compared to others ve tried my year old is happy and can chat away with friends at reasonable volume the look is pretty slick too for the price 
positive,kind of bummed worked great for months and now won charge so not useable kid isn hard gamer so didn use but once or twice week maybe others had better luck but it no go for us 
positive,i was looking for replacement mouse as my old mouse stopped working properly when ordered this first received mouse that did not work properly it went into sleep mode every few seconds requiring me to switch it off and back on in order to work again for few seconds contacted the company and they sent me replacement which works perfectly 
positive,great product great customer service great battery life it cool and amazing keyboard
positive,i use it lot had for over month no issues have gold and it cute very easy to maneuver 
positive,use the charger cable in edge of the box inside thin black box that looks like spacer do not use an apple macbook charger with its usb cable does not charge when connected to apple macbook charger with its usb cable sound quality and volume are great this speaker does barely squeeze into my bicycle bag that mounts to the handbag on my bike but after put the speaker then pack extra bubble wrap inside the bag because the speaker to round and tends to rotate while ride my bicycle when the speaker moves so the buttons are in the down position and hit bump on the trail then the speaker turns off 
neutral,i bought this mouse in june month later the wheel stopped working like the gold color and the smoothness of it but the wheel is something that would consistently need to use 
neutral,charging problems just got this months ago and is not charging
neutral,cord way too short sound comes and goes sad
positive,someone in my family asked for this product for christmas gift so after reading the great reviews bought it she used it for one week and it needed charged after that it wouldn hold charge for more than minutes after she told me this contacted the seller they immediately responded and offered to send me another one if was willing to send back the defective one am completely convinced that the one received just had defect they were so easy to work with and the replacement works perfectly 
positive,good value for wireless keyboard
neutral,was little squirrely to use
neutral,the scroll broke within hours of taking out of package can still use it to open tabs but can scroll

positive,i really love this mouse bought it for my office to get rid of the cords the colors are nice and like that it goes to sleep when not in use ve gotten many compliments on it 
neutral,only downside to this keyboard is that the enter key is too damn small keep on pressing but other then that keyboard is fine
neutral,does not work
neutral,this is quick responsive and easy to use mouse it can be run normally or with it built in lights sleeps after short period of unuse but wakes with single click micro usb charging cable included charges the mouse in no time light is on when charging and turns off when done with the sleep mode the battery lasts longer than expected 
positive,i like the color and the changing light the sleep mode is nice and saves battery life when you are not moving the mouse 
positive,fantastic sound and small enough to take anywhere
positive,i enjoy the bengoo stereo gaming headset mostly for the noise cancellation and the comfy ear cushion makes hearing the game much better as my were ears are less tired after long gaming session 
positive,loved it
positive,the sound is really impressive on this headset and like the sturdy mic rather than bendy one you can really complain for the price but the mic is mid it isn like razer mic duh but it picks up your voice just find with minimal background noise it comparable to my logitech webcam mic hope this helps 
positive,well the color is great but it stopped working after two uses tryed to charge it and it doesn even take charge won try anything from this vendor again 
positive,i love this mouse use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven used it in while however it is easy to wake up as well like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors its quite and moves smoothly did mention love it 
positive,connects easily super cute 
neutral,it worked good at first but it will not respond anymore even after being fully charged waste of money it cute though good thing it stopped working right away so can still return it 
positive,it started out great for about days now it works for minutes and won move the cursor around 
neutral,this is almost decent keyboard unfortunately some keys are in very unusual positions for example single apostrophe should be directly left of enter key and backslash should be directly above it this may not be important for casuals but this is anathema for coders didn use it long enough to test battery life 
positive,it was great until it stopped working won even turn on charged it of course and still doesn work at all time window to return passed really not what you expect from amazon ll be taking steps to get my money back you can bet on that don care how cheap it was 
negative,i bought pairs one broke within one day microphone broke off and the other set just sucks
positive,honestly love them and it not even for me they are just couple of dollars more than usual headphones but buy these instead the sound is so clear and the noise cancellation is good bought these for my fianc for gaming and he loves them 
neutral,no complaints
positive,pretty good quality for the price was very surprised they re not as good as turtle beaches but there are half the price and pretty close
positive,the mouse is slim which is nice it seems to be made of thinner plastic which feels flimsy but over all it pretty good for the price
positive,great works good
neutral,worked beautifully for month and then the roller ball broke guess you get what you pay for 
neutral,money well spent
positive,love that its rechargable and the led lights 
positive,great speaker great sound for the size cold be little louder
neutral,the mouse cursor jumps around and doesn stay where it supposed to 
positive,not extremely loud but bass is good pair and its worth the buy 
positive,wife loves it she uses it daily with no issues led is nice and bright would be nice to add larger capacity battery 
neutral,the product is cheap and worked well for the first months but after that it started becoming unresponsive would plug it in because thought it was low in power but that didn solve the issue either use lap top and have lap desk where it has built in mouse pad area ve had it for years so was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn able to read it so bought new mouse pad but still nothing tried updating drivers with various programs tweaked bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites nothing so disconnected it and brought out my wired mouse and it isn working either this product even disabled my track pad but luckily found way to get it working blame this crap product as it literally almost bricked my laptop
negative,microphone died within week of receiving returned for refund and shelled out the monies for turtle beach instead 
positive,love it it so sleek and comfortable to use love the color and the light changing aspect 
neutral,stop working after few days do not buy this mouse 
neutral,definitley bigger then the last one we had
neutral,this thing works great if you keep it plugged in my speaker has sat on the charger for over week now and is less than half charged think got lemon my brother has this same speaker and his charges full overnight 
positive,the lights are entertaining it works well and it survived the delivery driver squashing the package
neutral,i use it with my chromebook
neutral,they are designed with mm jack and usb cable my gaming laptop has an output mm port and an input port for the mic normally use only usb headphones which is what thought this headset was apparently the usb only powers the lights useless will never buy from this company again they got my money which is all they were after 
neutral,i work in warehouse environment driving powered equipment this speaker last my entire hour shift and has taken multiple falls and impacts without getting damaged love it 
positive,got this for my mother as christmas present and she uses it every day and absolutely loves it

positive,the jbl is really good speaker it surpasses my expectations and it has great sound quality with phone settings you can switch up the sound to your satisfaction am impressed with the tracking too love this product and will continue to use amazon for most purchases overall would absolutely recommend this product to others but make sure you have the right charger and buy case for it so it easy to carry around

positive,have nothing bad to say it does it job and does it well
neutral,the charge doesn last long the light work then doesn at times have it to my granddaughter she likes it enough 
positive,the sound quality is great and it just plain fun 
neutral,the mic volume is bit low even on high

neutral,quick working after one month
neutral,wasn working for me only the left ear sound was coming out of tried doing return and it shipped back out but never got my refund back 
positive,low profile feels good in the hand responsive
neutral,after few months several of the keys stopped working would not recommend

negative,stopped charging after months poor quality 
positive,it quiet and cute love all the colors and the battery last long time
neutral, 
neutral,don buy it waste your money 
neutral,they look cool but the volume doesn go high enough
neutral, updated after five months of use the keyboard suddenly died for no reason tried all troubleshooting could and it just doesn turn on turns on for about half second and turns back off guess you get what you pay for doesn last long whatsoever original review had been looking for wireless gaming keyboard that wasn loud and had backlighting it not the perfect keyboard and didn expect it to with that price the two things would change in their second version would be to make the rgb bit more versatile or customizable to save little on battery and make the keys feel little more clicky because hard to feel if the key went through sometimes overall love the weight its durability and slick look knocked it for two things but they are picky at this point 
neutral,while the mouse was ok at the beginning it is now lagging after about months of use ve had to order new mouse already to replace this one 
neutral,nice speaker
neutral,for the price you re getting something better than most other expensive headsets do want to say that the people who can get the mic to work need to stop using the splitter that thing is for older tower pc that use pair of ports one for the output and one for the input can use these on my laptop pc and use the mic fine without the splitter 
neutral,exactly what was needed description is accurate
positive,great sound
negative,a waste of my money doesn even charge on my laptop but hey guess you get what you pay for cause this is crap 
positive,i love the new headset ve gotten so much better of everything definitely recommend this product 
positive,i got this on sale during black friday it was great purchase works for camping trips and for trips to the river sound quality is never compromised and the volume goes way up great purchase 
neutral,this mouse worked perfectly for about months almost on the month mark exactly the scroll wheel stopped working it just spins and doesn move the cursor up and down the page looked to see if could return but the window closed month ago don be tempted by the cheap price should have stuck to name brand 
positive,headset works great sound is quite decent keeping in mind these arent sony headphones can go wrong for the price the lights gimmick does suck but who cares unless your yrs old
neutral,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it 
negative,this item is poorly made battery died within minutes after full charge hours it was returned the same day it was delivered

positive,klim chroma rechargeable keyboard is great don use it for gaming so cannot address that but for regular typing and daily usage it can be beat had defective key and contacted klim their customer care was superior and they truly value their customers replacement was promptly sent after few questions highly recommend klim for not only their products but for company that stands behind their products and that values their customers have purchased two klim keyboards and would do so again if needed to purchase another one 
positive,this is very nice mouse for my needs like how it lights up especially when am using it in the dark which makes it easier to use and appreciate that do not have to buy batteries worth the purchase

negative,i use this mouse for my laptop only when travel after about times using it the scroll no longer works even when completely charged unfortunately with such little use didn have much time to notice the defect and the return window has closed wouldn recommend it 
positive,i used this keyboard for regular day to day use and gaming first the left shift key failed after few months okay thought got another shift key couple of months later the top number one key failed okay thought again got number pad just no more exclamation points fine can yell at people anymore then the key failed now know this is dumb but seriously my response was fine ill use copy paste for the so go to google and fine to copy ctrl then got to type and use paste ctrl son of please don waste your money here get better keyboard for few more dollars from better manufacturer you deserve better also just like to say vvvvvvvvvvvv

negative,it quit working it dead er than door knob 
positive,pretty flimsy but still good mouse for the price 
neutral,i would not recommend this mouse as it feels like the plastic will break on you at any second it very cheaply made and the light shines through the top layer of plastic which makes it look way worse 
positive,i ve had this headset for over year now it good headset to use if you re on budget and just need basic use the sound is pretty good the only complaint have is the mic sound quality was told by my friends that sound muffled but that is to be expected for headset for this price still highly recommend buying this though because it definitely is great headset for its cheap affordable price it easy to use and for me has been quite durable normally cheap headsets will start to degrade and tear from excessive use but found that this material has held up good for my uses have big ears and found it to be pretty comfortable for my ears over long period of use definitely recommend buying it now as the price has dropped when first bought it the price was around 
positive,headset works great my boys say they wished the mic was just tad bit longer 
neutral,battery doesn last long maybe hrs at time 
positive,great keyboard wish it was brighter big doesn have the same shortcuts another keyboard had laptop wise but good 
positive,this came with an charging attachment but why this uses normal cell phone charger port and all the intuitions are in chinese theres random button at the top and when press it nothing happens and dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it other than that really like it so far its very sleek 
positive,works great just feels little flimsy so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse 
neutral,piece of junk doesn work probably why it on sale 
positive,love this thing especially when go fishing
positive,loved the headset perfect for gaming would definitely recommend

positive,really nice product works perfect really good sound quality and the battery gives you lot of time
neutral,if you re programmer or generally use the ctrl shift key combo please skip this the left ctrl shift combination doesn work so you ll have to retrain yourself to use the right only apparently this is known and ongoing issue it not worth the time or effort

positive,i was debating between this speaker and the ultimate ears megaboom my friend actually bought the ue megaboom at the same time bought the jbl charge can say this speaker has more bass and is louder in volume prefer the directional speakers on this there is front where sound is clearer and louder and back don love how there isn strap or loop or something to grip but did buy really cool silicone case for that has strap and doesn alter the sound 
positive,i am so happy with this purchase can believe what great sounding portable speaker this is love this speaker so much that even just got case to protect it not that it needs but it built like tank and the other great thing is that it can even charge your phone if you need to but man awesome sound think it good price for it 
positive,solid battery life and great aesthetic worth every penny 
positive,i upgraded from jbl flip that couldn hold charge after about years was hesitant about buying speaker that has only driver but so far have zero complaints run speakers hard at my job and this one has no difficulty at all keeping up with the challenges give it it has huge battery that will certainly last you for hours have currently used it for roughly hours at work today at higher volumes and it claims to still be near full charge only time will tell another cool thing these speakers can do is connect to other speakers that have the same jbl connect feature other coworkers have compatible speakers that they love to hook up to it and it certainly turns work into party would highly recommend this speaker if you re looking for something that puts out high volume and has great battery life 
neutral,the scrolling wheel is already broken and havent even used the mouse for month 
positive,i got this to replace my white one that broke well let just say love it it stays charged very long time and the color change is beautiful
negative,you get what you pay for weak mic requires manual adjusting through computer sensitivity is low so you may have to raise it or scream into the mic 
positive,i love my speaker it my best friend 
positive,works well as described slim and easy to use even came with dongle for usb if your computer has it lights can be turned on and off 
positive,my daughter seems to be happy with it it must cancel noise because she can hear me when talking to her now just need some noise canceling headphones while she gaming lol
neutral,scroll button stopped working within weeks
positive,nice product at fair price like it loud and it is plenty loud 
neutral,i very much liked it
neutral,great little board but they need to alter the led settings mainly the thing needs to not fall asleep on me in the dark cuz its getting old 
positive,love the vivid color it has nice feature of the lights not staying on all the time so to save the battery life love that 
positive,great gift for year old grandson 
neutral,love this but it looses its juice within hours without it being plugged in work hour shift so have to plug it in during very busy shift so need one with battery
neutral,i have been using this mouse for days and the scroll wheel broke completely when pressed it it was alright in its short days comfortable but the scroll wheel clicked very loudly which didn like don waste your money 
positive,the scrolling wheel doesn work my daughter was so excited to use this but it won scroll other than that cute mouse 
positive,just like described very pleased we also had an issue with not getting our first speaker reached out to the company and they were so willing to work with us to get replacement sent out asap would highly recommend this company and product without hesitation 
neutral,haven had it year and have barely used it and it already stopped working right the mouse just goes all over the place on the screen and not where you try to put it 
neutral,this was pretty frustrating to use it kept shutting off and the tracking was pretty awful ended up throwing it away after about two weeks worth of use 
positive,my younger don first bought this mouse for his mac mini since then we fell in love with it and my wife bought this for her work laptopit nice to get the customization of color and also very ergonomic in use and effective in performancewe use this mouse in all kinds of setting desk lap bed and even in cars never had issuesawesome and looking forward to rd one to buy 
positive,awesome for gaming love it 
negative,it was nice and sleek it felt very cheaply made though and it died within weeks of having it wouldn turn on even charged it would not recommend buying it 
positive,i love this product
positive,nice quality beautiful cards 
neutral,i bought this month ago and taken care of it and now it can turn off you try to turn it off it turns on right way what waste of money don recommend buying jbl products 
neutral,i ve had this for few weeks and it already useless it won charge when connected horrible 
positive,this headset is really nice only big thing is that you can use the mic and lights at the same time it one or the other the mic makes me sound really clear and love how you can hear bass clearly 
positive,the sound quality is excellent charge capacity is incredible 
positive,works great one of the best headsets so far good for gaming 
positive,won recharge lasted not even week 
positive,awesome little speaker for traveling or hanging out by the pool
neutral,smooth clicking ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use 
neutral,i had this keyboard for months and recently as other reviewers have mentioned the bluetooth receiver fell apart it was kind of loose in the usb port for while but managed to leave it alone however packing and unpacking my laptop more than usual on business trip jiggled it enough that it came out except the shell of the receiver is still stuck in the port will have to take it somewhere to have professional use pliers and whatever to unstick that without damaging the laptop as would likely do on my own while it was working the keyboard performed fine only had to plug it in to charge it few times since it didn even last year because one of the most essential elements was made with shoddy materials have to give stars though 
positive,literally from the box it won light up or download the software to be able to use my mouse won move and it says compatible with mac that is absolutely untrue can you explain to me why that stated in the description it the only reason purchased this and it doesn work disappointed 
positive,it great and affordable headset for gaming great noise cancelation and sound quality 
positive,good mouse holds good charge perfect for gaming 
positive,these headphones are awesome they re great for the money they cancel out the noise they work perfect they were just bought for my significant other for work and she loves them am willing to bet they would great for gaming though great sound 
neutral,i got this keyboard because the crappy logitech wireless keyboard my office gave me was not as responsive as would like this keyboard is very responsive since it is technically gaming keyboard the keys are quiet except the space bar which makes click sound but it nothing major and is less noisy than my old keyboard 
positive,not to many wireless mid range bluetooth speakers can hang with jbl maybe braven but that about it bose is great but jbl got them on the bass in mid size speakers 
negative,the charger was real pain my kids stopped using it the nd week
neutral,i only used this mouse few times and the wheel scroll broke after months would other wise be stars
positive,nice upgrade from my st gen charge which still works perfectly as well 
positive,love it have had many portable speakers knowing full well that portability would sacrifice sound quality not so with my jbl charge great sound so easy to connect works great in the yard and on my boat got great deal on it as well definitely would like to try out the connect feature when pick up another one 
positive,excellent battery life so far right out of the box with no charge it lasted hours straight sound quality excellent little larger and heavier than thought it would be perfect for working in kitchen but little too big for my disc golf bag 
neutral,it looks great and feels good in the hand but the scroller broke after couple months 
positive,the speakers sound amazing and the two that purchased immediately paired using the jbl connect app my only concern is that neither charging door closes tightly or seals shut which makes me believe that they wouldn be waterproof since water or liquids would easily enter the usb ports 
positive,they are really good headset for the price searched for awhile and they are probably the best headset at this price point on amazon without skimping on quality got these for my sister on xmas amd she uses them all the time 
neutral,i needed wireless mouse for my new macbook pro that only has usb connections this mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard usb bluetooth receiver to be used in the usb port have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far but it seems very responsive and performed well the led lights are kinda cool but not really needed trying to see if there is way to use the mouse without the led lights on so can conserve the charge on the battery the only concern issue ve had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don seem to be the most secure and couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the usb port as recommended in the user manual the user manual specifically recommends not using plug in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it it is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse we ll see how it goes in the future if it turns out that it was operator error may update my rating overall though the mouse feels good in my hand and it seems to work well doing everything necessary when need it 
negative,the usb port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for days there was nothing that happened that would have should have caused the usb to break other than it being poorly made am very disappointed with the outcome 
positive,i bought these headphones on lightning sale wanting decentish set of headphones with mic pleasantly surprised with the good quality of the input and output would recommend if you re looking for good set of headphones without breaking the bank 
positive,very nice keyboard easy to set up easy to use all the keys function great 
neutral,while the shape of this rechargable mouse is nice the crappy battery refused to be recharged after less than three months don buy this 
positive,i have used these headphones for multiple years am power user say remote worker with hours of meetings every day still can believe that they are so good for such an amazing price the cord is super long during meetings can get up and walk around noise cancellation is amazingly good they are comfortable they have volume control and mute control on the headphones themselves what more could you possibly want hope they sell these forever 
positive,was gift very happy with it 
negative,i admit that might have overused it since bought it for my work from home but my sis got similar one which is why bought this one and that one actually lasts days without the need of chargei needed to charge this one multiple times on the day and at one point it just wouldn work even while plugged in so still needed to switch to the old oneit is really disappointing idk if got faulty product or if that is actually the extent of its productivity
positive,this is great for remote work or personal use true to description silent sleek and easy to use bang for your buck for sure 
neutral,i was looking for deep base with portable size for travel if needed used it indoor amazing sound didn try yet outdoor but its the expected jbl quality
positive,i absolutely love my mouse it good quality and last pretty long time before needing charge 
positive,great headphones 
positive,love my speaker this is the best and its so loud love it
positive,the mouse works great until it goes to sleep agggh then you have to shake tap hard against your palm so you don smash it to pieces or flip the switch back and forth it quite irritating if it was as simple as on and off it would be perfect 
positive,nice looking mouse beautiful colors and comfortable hold for any sized hands the battery on this thing is surprising charging does take time but seriously that won be problem because this thing can last long do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn drain sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won get caught off guard for when it does lose battery 
neutral,charged the mouse over use it for min it completely drain out and it too late to return since bought it months ago what wast 
positive,it very big and clunky but give very competent sound and bass cancelling outside noises it useful for when you don have to put batteries in your wireless gamer headphones 
positive,bought for my wife she loves it she sets it in the driveway for working out volleyball courts the pool and everywhere else sounds great and is loud enough for any situation 
positive,absolutely amazing product cant get use it enough especially with the color light feature the scroll bar is very smooth and the mouse itself fits perfectly in your hand not to mention there is no batteries required since it it rechargeable definitely worth star rating 
positive,this mouse was purchased for year old girl she loves the colors the fit and the fact that it works without making noise 
positive,i ve had the same jbl speaker for almost years now and decided finally wanted to upgrade for better sound am so glad did the sound quality is lot better than had even thought it would be highly recommend this speak to anyone looking for something that portable with great sound
positive,absolute garbage day of using if you have it on the multicolor setting the mouse will not work should have known something was up when the instructions were only in mandarin it went straight to the trash can after couldn get it to work it also feels super cheap please if you re reading these reviews we re not lying do not buy this mouse 
positive,the colors are fun and different the thing did not like was that the default color is red if it is not in rainbow mode the material is okay it works at it should it is great that its rechargeable it holds charge for long time and if you forget to turn it off the sleep mode works well 
positive, the mouse is low profiled easy to use it connects instantly and is ready to use as soon as you plug the adapter into your computer it is very comfortable to use and the video shows it extra cool light show 
positive,i really like this mouse it small and slim so it doesn make my wrist sit at weird angle it also has good battery life think ve only charged it like once since bought it several months ago it pretty responsive and light and overall it great quality for the money it does feel little cheap and fragile because of how light it is but that doesn bother me at all 
neutral,i work in fast paced setting being able to un dock and move needed something small to transport this fut my need actually bought two may buy more for my team 
neutral,really cool setup only drawback is you have to order usb adapter separate to use the light function on ps 
positive,i love how the sound response on this headset 
positive,bought them for my yo to use he hasnt complained yet so guess they re good
positive,i was little worried about battery life based on some of the other reviews am not gamer have an office job but on my computer probably hours day and used my mouse extensively single charge lasts me days you can also use the mouse when you are charging have usb port on my keyboard that use per my attached picture as you can see the charging cable is pretty short so some might need to extend the cord but overall am very happy with this mouse 
neutral,bought for my son as present it fit the bill and was actually more than he expected did price comparison and it beat the competition hands down 
neutral,won stay charged 
positive,perfect christmas gift
positive,got this as birthday present sounds quality was ok but the max sound is not very high could also never get the mic to work even after about an hour troubleshooting would not recommend to other buyers spend few more bucks for something better quality if you plan to game often 
neutral,this is well worth the money 
negative,noiseless very light and comfortable mouse but there was card in the same box saying if you will write review we will return the money spent on the mouse that not true spent time going through this process for nothing do not believe them was disappointed 
neutral,i bought this for cross country move in moving truck with bad radio had one day of driving hours and this thing still had ish percent battery left after running all of those hours sound quality is great for smaller speaker too 
negative,i have had this mouse for month and other than like the colors it is worthless have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic tried recharging and it is no better and today it just died in the middle of zoom meeting was hosting am flushing it and making note to never purchase this brand again

positive,this mouse feels and looks very good as cool affordable mouse recommend it to anyone looking to buy rgb wireless mouse 
neutral,really smooth soft click liked 
neutral,hi love it but bought it because it changed colors and it only stays on red 
negative,this mouse was ok when first got it have usb port in my tablet and ordered mouse for port what received was mouse for usb port an adapter not great solution as it sticks out from the tablet and tends to get hit by other objects plus an additional point of failure the mouse worked well for about weeks and then died it would take charge and show fully charged but then when turned on to either of the on positions the mouse would light up for seconds and then die discarded this mouse and used another one had around 
neutral,i bought one of these and liked it so much that got one for both of my daughters also 
neutral,my son just opened these for christmas he went to pull the microphone down over his mouth the first time he used them and it snapped off 
neutral,good
positive,the jbl charge is awesome the sound is incredible the battery life is amazing 
negative,bass is weak volume is low no way to adjust this was more than the oontz angle bt speaker that got three years ago and it not better at all holding down the bt button with the button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down these are not helpful don waste your money on this if you re looking for anything other that very poor bass and it overheats like snowflake in the sun so if you want to take it to the beach don just don buy this 
neutral,there is nothing wrong it amazing
negative,the mouse itself still works but the usb port has just broken in million pieces my laptop stays at home and it is what use as my home computer after about month of use the usb port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone one more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or will be unable to use the mouse 
positive,sleek attractive and the color change option is beautiful you can keep solid red or let the colors rotate 
positive,awesome
positive,the connection as wireless mouse works well however clicking is challenge am not sure how to explain it it is not ergometric and it doesn click am not sure why people would enjoy this mouse don recommend it 
positive,i love that it bluetooth but wish it had an remote control 
positive,works well and looks great
positive,i loved this little mouse it looked great it felt great in my hand the wheel was nice for scrolling the battery even held charge for what thought was reasonable amount of time would categorize my usage as light moderate use and no abuse then came the day about month after arrival right after the return window closed that it started glitching now it drops off not responding then will work again then drop off again and not talking about sleep mode this is during active use back and forth back and forth it frustrating probably more because so desperately want mouse instead of my laptop trackpad all that said didn spend whole lot of money on this mouse so get what pay for just wish had gotten little more than month before the glitching 
positive,powerful little guy good bass good volume looking for good wireless speaker this will not dissapoint

positive,this was an inexpensive headset and it true you get what you paid for guess after two months of my son playing with it at his desk it just stopped working you could tell the materials were cheap by the feel of the headset but expected it to last year or so at least want to add received an mail from this company today they offered me new updated version of this headset if would remove this review some people might do just that and some of you might think it nice thing to do but leave reviews for things like lot or have serious problem and want to make sure their honest reviews based on my experience so refused the off

neutral,i have seen some reviews on here saying that there is no way to turn off the lights but you can you have to press fn the pause break button twice and the lights will turn off 
positive,super comfortable headset plugs in and ready to play good value for money 
neutral,liked everything
positive,great product for great price 
neutral,not bad pretty smooth operation no delays in movement connects quickly to any lap top 
neutral,beautifully produced and lovely to look at for mouse the lights are welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace did notice that it tends to go into sleep mode quickly but takes longer wake up time than expect on screen busy with windows the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life it frustrating for anyone who isn patient 
positive,good value for what you pay they re comfortable the lights aren too bright and the sound is decent

positive,highly recommend silent click is great you have the option to turn off the color changing mode 
negative,came and broke writhing one day it was dropped one foot and broke 
neutral,my daughter games and needed new headset this one works nicely for her 
positive,it solid keyboard it feels very light and less substantial that my previous ms wireless comfort keyboard which is still going strong after years it also feels very soft to the touch both the material itself and the key presses think part of this is in the waterproof design what really bought this for is smaller footprint than my previous keyboard it full size keyboard that requires substantially less desktop space it makes difference for my use backlighting for when typing at night and don want the harshness of an overhead light or even lamp sometimes the backlighting on this is great if you re fine with the multi color there is an option to turn it off during the day and there is also dimmer which works great what doesn work it weird but when editing text often use ctrl shift and the arrow keys to highlight large chunks of text at time so far this works on this keyboard but only if using ctrl shift keys on the left side together or the right side together it doesn fully work when use right ctrl left shift right arrow keys weird would have much preferred standard sized carriage return enter key for you youngins now to press enter my pinky has to travel much farther and it takes noticeable effort the old school reverse shaped enter key is king hope maybe on the version they will correct this if they did it would be worth buying again for that change alone still getting adjusted to the slightly new layout and key response my typing isn as fast yet find with this soft key press business have to press little more aggressively to get the space bar for instance to register it slight but noticeable whether you think that good thing or not is up to you definitely needs palm rest sensitive hands wrists may still prefer the design of curved keyboard swear by curved split keyboards they make difference don use it for gaming so no comment there imagine it responsive enough 
positive,bought this headset for my son to play fortnite on the nintendo switch and he loves it after buying much more expensive headset that did not work right this one was much better choice

positive,jbl bluetooth wireless speakers are by far the best purchase you can make if you are looking for something with long battery life and awesome sound quality own of these and use them both daily

positive,i have bought several of these since this first one they work amazing have had no issues and recommend this seller and mouse brand alot the price is so good 
negative,don buy it it can hold charge it moves on it own and was way too expensive for how crappy it was 
neutral,we purchased two of these and the scrollers broke on both of them in less than two months there was no trauma to them they re just junk 
positive,this mouse doesn work it may go few days of being ok but it doesn track properly and takes several minutes to start working then it ll go days without working at all charge it for hours at time so know that not the problem 
positive,i bought this to replace my year old ue boom there was nothing wrong with my boom just wanted an upgrade so thought it was bigger than my ue boom which was no big deal but after charged the jbl and connected it was very disappointed the sound was very muffled hooked up my boom to friend phone and played the same sound on both what huge difference in my opinion the ue boom blows this jbl away 
positive,i was shocked at the great sound quality ease of use and design of this speaker don know how went this long without it 
neutral,it worked for min and then got stuck in my laptop looks like made of cheap material
positive,this is my second speaker and love it especially since you can connect two or more together to have music playing in every room at the same time
neutral,purchased december quit working may will not hold charge and will not turn on 
positive,its decent all around but the mic quality is kinda bad and the sound quality like bass wise could also use some work but overall pretty good
neutral,lasted little over month and the scroll wheel stopped working 
neutral,this keyboard goes in and out will work then stops now its has stop working don buy call warranty co and was told to make claim they provide the wrong site so the claim that was submitted was for their clothing rep didn refer me to another site amazon wasn useful either 
neutral,i have fan and this mic picks it up which is good and bad but id get for definitely not the price is not worth it tbh 
positive,perfect for work used days without charging 
positive,works great great value for the money 
neutral,seamless connectivity to my pc

negative,the mouse worked for less then day bought it for school so could edit thing and it stopped working within minutes even after being charged the night before don buy this product its waste of money 
positive,love it its way better then the beats pill 
positive,this mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use love the lights that constantly change while you re using it the best part for me is the fact that it rechargeable just plug it into any usb plug it into my laptop at the end of the day battery usually lasts me few full days of work sleep mode is great and helps prolong battery life 
positive,wanted speaker that was capable of playing music at louder volume in warehouse and home etc this does the job 
positive,sounds great
positive,i used these headphones for gaming and they were by far the best headphones especially considering it price the earmuffs fit nicely on my ears and are very comfortable what would make these headphones even better would be the ability to change how high low you want the sound of the game versus the sound of voice chat and vice versa like ps headphones 
neutral,i ve had this headset for less than months and the mic has already started to go out have to have the cord certain way for it to work if the mic is working and move the cord whoever is on the other end can hear ridiculous amount of feedback play on twitch streams so it great to go back to watch and all you can focus on is the feedback from this headset not worth the spent rather buy razer headset that ll cost me more in the beginning but don have to worry about it braleaking months in 
neutral, while the product looks great it not very ergonomic for me noticed pain in my hands after only few days of usage not great for long period usage 
positive,i ve been around music my entire life including spinning records at top nightclubs where jbl was the speaker of choice really wanted to love this speaker but it not happening jbl should be ashamed of themselves the sound quality is horrible the speaker clips at between and of the volume using my phone at way the speaker music coming out is missing everything including clarity bass treble yes stereo everyone with reviews complaining about dead music coming out is absolutely correct the speaker plays dead music especially at higher volumes anyone wanting cheap portable speaker with horrible sound this is for you anyone looking for great speaker this is not for you yes you get what you pay for but with today technology every speaker should sound great take look at the marshall bluetooth speakers they re amazing also if you don need portability the klipsch speakers are amazing sonos is overrated find myself always going back to the good old names from decades ago even the bose speaker selling for around on sale right now at bb sounds better than these jbl speakers folks take look at the bose marshall bt speakers you ll really enjoy the sound especially from the marshall woburn ii have the bose soundtouch the speaker blows away every speaker on the market also had the marshall stanmore hooked up to my phone and computer it rocked if you can find the old bose acoustic wave in mint condition that was once an amazing speaker too hope this review helps you thanks for reading it 
negative,i ordered two and within one time use neither one of them works any longer what kind of horrid product is this company supplying company like amazon with and they are not cheap by any means so disappointed in amazon allowing this product to be sold on their site have never been so distraught with any of my purchases with amazon ever but this one really places shame on amazon would like full replacement for both because have two work pcs for my job one for the usa and another pc for accounts out of the country latin america that was the purpose for purchasing two 
positive,i like how light and easy to handle is 
negative,bought this for my son to use for school the roller bar broke the second time he used it in addition to this it wouldn stay charged dissatisfied customer 
positive,i followed instructions for charging and tried few different methods but could never get this to power on or work the company was great to quickly refund it though 
positive,i don know about gaming but for everything else it works great 
positive,the color is spot on it is ergonomic and more flat than arched sometimes think it is too wide but yet it not the price was right the color choices were great overall happy that found this mouse it was for my apple laptop as it didn have one and hated not having mouse to navigate
neutral,worked for couple months doesn anymore
positive,i bought this speaker for our pool in our park its just enough to carry great sound for everyone to enjoy
positive,my son uses these for gaming on his switch and listening to music on his tablet his friends can hear him and he can hear them clearly 
neutral,this was gift for my kidos birthday its st use was on january th its mic died on february th was great until it died had to go back to the cheap ear buds am days past the return go figure thanks for turning my money into garbage so fast 
positive,fits well and comfortable for my year old great price too the plastic seems little cheap but looks like it will hold up well enough to my rough year old boy 
positive,very plush and somewhat comfortable but the microphone doesn work at all the sound quality isn great either but at least that works 
positive,love it so far got it was basically fully charged and played all day at the pool barely saw any decrease in power love the sound and the good bass able to control sound eq via the settings on my phone for those recognizing it doesn seem to have an eq in an app or something we are stepping up from the jbl clip which is also really great just doesn have the volume we wanted for patio or at the pool fills locker room full of sound easy too able to listen at low volume and still have full depth of sound many commented about the mono sound aspect but honestly love this sound it full and the highs mids are pronounced with clarity no distortion my only nit is that it definitely will muffle if like towel is over it or something not really worth knocking my rating tho had it in my sport bag and could notice decrease in clarity solid purchase very happy with it 
positive,ok my trackball that ve had for years is dying so went back to the mouse you can spend over on mouse but unless you are hardcore gamer and even then probably not worth it to be honest so went with this affordable mouse totally works it is very thin think would have liked little more meat on it maybe even for it to be big heavier but it so it worth it recommend 
negative,very disappointed recevied this item december th unoxed it on december th today is jan th and the mouse stop working 
neutral,the mouse itself is nice but the usbc part does not fit into my surface nor does the usb part fit bought this because have new surface and needed usbc to usb connection so could use the mouse with the surface guess the specs are different in china had to go back and buy usbc so could use the mouse attached is picture of the one had to buy do not recommend unless you want project 
negative,i purchased this as replacement for previous headset and you definitely get what you pay for this is poor quality and arrived in state where it constantly cut out and the microphone barely worked avoid this 
positive,just great item
positive,microphone is super faint and far away people can barely hear at all
neutral,been through few inexpensive headsets for son gaming these performed better than the others 
neutral,these are pretty good headphones but for some reason others can hear me when speak
positive,usb connection is weird for ps doesn work for anything but charging comfortable ear piece and good price but sound quality on highest setting is mediocre at best decent treble and bass levels too but output is garbage 
neutral,was not disappointed 
positive,love howling the battery lasts
neutral,wore for like mins and had to take them off because the ear cushion is really small it pressed up against my ears probably fits kids only
positive,this was gift for one of my grandsons and he uses it with his switch his brother also has one that he has had for about year so asked them about their experiences grandson says he likes the mic and the noise cancellation helps with any surround sound overall they are perfect for any device with circle headphone slot grandson says he loves them they are comfortable and can be adjusted he likes the mic they say five stars 
positive,super quiet keys and great feeling makes my setup up look extra clean without all the wires
neutral,looks just like the pic 
positive,this product wasn terrible as it had good sound quality but the fact of the matter is got it last august and all of sudden it just stopped working while in an xbox party with my friends had headset before this that stopped working but it lasted more than years this headset not even lasting months is an embarrassment and wish bought another headset
positive,very good quality my son loves them 
neutral,this speaker has amazing sound and love the fact that if you have multiple jbl speakers you can sync them all little heavier than would have liked for beach bag but no too heavy at all ve already taken this speaker on three trips with me and it been hit 
neutral,no charger included wow that something sound is ok not sure if should keep it or return it ll give couple of days will try charge for decision
positive,my laptop doesn have light up keys and prop it higher so don put strain on my neck this wireless laptop came at great price and is made in america 
positive,great speaker until it completely died on me year after purchase will not hold charge or play sound now but will turn on wish had bought the warranty 
neutral,very good noise cancelation for the price 
positive,dear jbl next model update it would be nice to have strap or lanyard have flip and an extreme and they all have either strap or lanyard which use often both for work and play otherwise no complaints 
positive,i have charge and flip we have taken these everywhere know the charge has been thrown tossed and dropped the throw slightly opened the case but it snapped right back together and sounds as good as when we got it love these things great sound and great battery life 
positive,i was little worried about battery life based on some of the other reviews am not gamer have an office job but on my computer probably hours day and used my mouse extensively single charge lasts me days you can also use the mouse when you are charging have usb port on my keyboard that use per my attached picture as you can see the charging cable is pretty short so some might need to extend the cord but overall am very happy with this mouse 
negative,i bought the jbl charge in the summer of months later and now it won take charge and shuts off within about minute of turning it on while plugged in so it is completely unusable assume that maybe just bought lemon but this has been problem for all the jbl speakers ve bought ve owned the jbl earbuds jbl clip and jbl clip my jbl clip is the only one still working going to try another brand because tired of having to throw away speakers 
positive,the usb adapter is ill fitting and won keep charging the mouse unless it is held and tilted just so luckily have another adapter and that is working fine so the mouse itself is good 
neutral, chinese junk lasted month
neutral,not very comfortable 
positive,i work on computers all day this mouse has easily become my favorite mouse use it for all of my computer tasks on both computers love this mouse very sleek 
positive,been using this keyboard for more than week now not gamer but was looking for good wireless keyboard that will relax my fingers thank goodness found this keyboard it wide quiet key pressed except for spacebar and very comfortable to use 
positive,great quality sound easy to connected to devices
neutral,just as advertised 
positive,bought this for my kiddos laptop she likes the lights and the almost weightless feeling it was good buy for the price and works great so far 
neutral,great for the first month got now one of them sounds like crap buzzing on the bass even at moderate volume don blast it either so figure it must be build quality update second one has gotten flaky after running the power to zero once it is usually plugged in all the time as speaker for my amazon echo and got unplugged when furniture got moved disappointed that flagship company like jbl would have such poor quality 
positive,so far it works well for what do which is just playing online with my friends but the mic works well and the sound quality is very good it the first headset ve ever bought but satisfied with the purchase 
positive,perfect for my year old for gaming 
neutral,worked great till the roller broke used times 
negative,the first two weeks of using this headset was great but something happened after putting it away and the quality is just poor and is cheaply made do not recommend 
neutral,excelente
positive,i am blown away at how poor this product truly is at first thought it didn work at all because there was no sound but apparently half charge is not enough for there to be sound but once it was fully charged it worked once getting the product working turned on some music and the amount of bass ruined the music had to download an equalizer app just to get the music to even sound decent and not crackle took it to work the next day with full charge and went to use it and again no sound turned it off and took it home still with full battery went to try it again few days later and the battery was drained even though it had been turned off overall am impressed with not one thing about this speaker and you are proud to charge as much as you do for this product have better success buying one from the dollar store do not buy 
negative,i splurged and bought an expensive keyboard it stopped working in month with light use tried to resync the dongle and spent several hours troubleshooting am totally disappointed 
neutral,these headsets bought pairs didn even work right the first time either were used clicking the sound button does nothing to shut the sound off nor does switching the mic part up there are just time while playing cod where everyone does not need to hear my background noise one of the pairs got stuck all the way extended and can get it to go back in all in all say invest bit more money and get nicer pair 
positive,we bought our first pair of these and liked them so we decided to buy second pair great quality especially for the price you plug theae right into your controller they re also very comfortable 
neutral,it does not work for xbox live without adapter all lies in the description all lies 
positive,this product works great my husband loved it 
neutral,the wheel button feels like it requires the force to activate and makes the noise of the other buttons whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun the wheel button gets more use in cad software than any other button and not even minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where can not continue to work 
neutral,smooth operation 
positive,my father has one jbl just like this one that love and that why bought guess wasn lucky with my jbl because it won charge am waiting for the seller to contact me still want jbl but one that works
positive,great product love the features sound quality and durability
positive,for the size of this unit and the design of the passive woofers the bass should be deeper mids and highs are clean bluetooth range is excellent maybe its because the drivers are parallel to the surface first facing upward downward have smaller the size single bluetooth speaker and it bass is excellent for its size it connects immediately 
neutral,a very reasonably priced cordless rechargeable mouse with button control with scroll wheel which is my preference rather than the macbookair track pad or the mac mouse for the desktop mac 
positive,jbl always great product this is the rd one of their products we bought and love them great sound even in the smaller ones always priced right 
neutral,the mouse wheel broke and just spins now used this for my work laptop and loved it but if this is the quality it is will not buy another
positive,using this mouse for my dell laptop works great 
neutral,this is the second time buy it it has everything no need for battery you hock it up to laptop for charging and that it comfortable while holding it moving smoothly and got very appealing look bought another one from another brand and stopped working after awhile this one is the real deal and no more exploring other mouses sticking with it 
positive,got this headset to replace cheaper one that my son had that broke he loves it it is comfortable and has controls that are super easy to work comes with multiple adapters for different gaming controller types 
neutral,speaker sounds great but now just cuts off after months of use super annoying having to reconnect unfortunately outside of the service window but hoping jbl will fix it 
positive,i love this speaker the battery lasts for good while charge it once month and use it for about minutes each day during the week the quality is great ve had absolutely no problems with mine buy another one if something happened to the one have 
neutral,had this mouse for about month and the center wheel broke as was scrolling used daily for work 
positive,love my new speaker and the fact that it is pink 
neutral,i thought this mouse was really cool but then it broke the scrolly wheel thing doesnt move anymore it lasted like week and its not my main computer so it didnt get used much in that week 
positive,i use this for my pc gaming and it works great
positive,ordered this for my little brother and he loves it plus blue is his fav color 
neutral,easy to charge and to use 
positive,this is for doing school work and casual browsing being gamer wouldn use this for gaming for anyone who is asking but as standard wireless mouse it works great with no concerns as of yet like that you don have to replace disposable batteries and it charges quickly via charging cable that comes with the mouse as well as instructions you won need them as it very simple to figure it all out the color changing lights are nice touch that my year old loves would strongly recommend especially for the price enjoy the product so far especially for school work and internet browsing 
positive,my son loves it 
negative,i bought this yesterday to replace broken mouse day has incredibly noticeable lag fully charged it before using it it runs about the same as turtle stuck in syrup this isn worth just buy different mouse update the brand behind this sent me an email from shady address claiming to be amazon custom service and offered me to delete the review not chance urge you to stay away from this brand they re shady af they ll try to scam you after you buy their scummy product 
negative,unfortunately the keyboard came out of the box not holding charge few weeks of office work later the key stopped working properly tossed the box so am on returning it here shopping for new one and only had it for about month 
positive,love it fyi use the usb under mouse and push hard no clear instructions
positive,worked great initially it was cute and charged easily and quickly now after months it glitches and does not glide smoothly and will not hold charge would not recommend 
neutral,forgot it was wireless was even more extactic to get it
positive,my son loves this he was so happy christmas morning works great worth the money recommend buying it 
neutral,bought this to go with my pc back in march after about months some of the keys lag out or do not function at all 
neutral,it fills the bill not too expensive works fine 
positive,works great
positive,this is the best speaker ive ever had its super good 
positive,i love how fast it connects and how cute it looks
negative, update after left the below negative review the company contacted me and offered me to remove it would assume that several reviewers have taken them up on this offer and have removed negative reviews so not only is the product junk but the company has shady business practices skip it go somewhere else this is the second pair bought for my son guess didn learn my lesson the first time first one worked for two months this one worked for less than two weeks it ish for reason don waste your time 
neutral,works well when charged nearly impossible to charge though the port connection must be off 
positive,love the sturdy feel of these headphones and the sound just got them think they will hold up for quite while 
positive,comfortable and responsive mouse clicking is indeed very quiet lights are just as advertised and battery is more than satisfactory can use multiple days without charging 
positive,sounds great and it rocks 
positive,boyfriend loves it for his gaming 
neutral,it was nice and lould 
neutral,volume level needs to be high for microphone to work normally but the high volume has way too much base and hurts your ears plus the ear muffs are too small need to spend about or more on quality headsets like astro turtle beach or other brands 
negative,this mouse was terrible it worked very inconsistently and have already replaced it with one that actually works it was very disappointing 
positive,this speaker is perfect for taking anywhere sounds great you can connect multiple devises via bluetooth at the same time 
neutral,broke after month couldn hear out of them anymore
positive,this speaker is what you would need if you want something thats loud but has great bass even on low volume this speaker has incredible bass the sound at just of the volume sounds really loud the battery life is as it promises in my experience played from of battery at percent of volume for up to days until it died
positive,great for cod
neutral,not fan wouldn sync with one computer worked great with the other computer but it didn sleep when was done with it so the next day the battery was dead ll never remember to turn off the mouse when not using it so this is not going to be very useful 
neutral,like it
positive,my nephew needed headset for his gaming needs and he absolutely loves this headset 
positive,i love this wireless mouse it has nice led lights on it and it lasts for up to days without charge definitely recommend this product 
positive,i really enjoy this product and am very happy with the quality of it the only thing dislike is that can listen to music without getting buzz out other than that very good headset highly recommend it 
neutral,loud enough for what needed it for battery life depends on how loud you use it don forget to turn it off when you are not using it and the battery will last longer 
positive, great mouse fits my hand easy to use
neutral,ok
negative,broken right after ran out of return window came the narrow keep moving and linking event when is using or not using it don know what problem with it 
positive,i am senior citizen and have always considered bose the standard in speakers but this product exceeded my expectations got it refurbished and so it was great bargain works great 
neutral,i can trust this keyboard to type read every key type it constantly misses letters and entering hidden passwords are pain because you don know if the keyboard even registered the key you hit 
neutral,good thing it rechargeable because otherwise your changing batteries everyday instead of just plugging it in 
positive,i bought this because hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when need it it charges by plugging it into the laptop but haven had to do that yet besides giving it full charge when opened it up the first time it does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took minute to figure out but once you realize that it not broken just asleep it all good overall it just basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable 
positive,great sound and easy to use
positive,i really liked this mouse but the battery runs out every few days wish the lights would automatically turn off after not being used for few minutes 
neutral,if you had that ve never ending need to have wireless mouse that has led colors on it that needs to be constantly plugged in for it to work then this is for you the charge on it will last approximately hours before it dead if you turn off the pretty lights then maybe it will last hours really not functional wireless mouse don buy it 
positive,my son uses it for gaming online with friends he loves 
neutral,excelente
neutral,i bought this weeks ago and now the scroll doesn work if you need mouse choose something other than this 
positive,this was my second purchase bought one in june and it worked fine the charging port metal liner part fell out so it couldn be charged got another and used it for about an hour without any problems charged it used it for another hours then it just suddenly quit when turn it off and on again the red lights flash once then nothing completely useless 
neutral,don waste your money it worked well for few weeks long enough to miss the return window but then got jumpy erratic and wouldn hold charge unless plugged in 
positive,the fact that it has quiet mechanism no sound whatsoever during clicking was great but even though only used it for my desktop computer at work days week it is not working right now did not carry it around or used it for more than hour during each day basically because use my laptop most of time months is pretty premature time frame to not function 
positive,simple to use long battery life recharges by plugging into your computer this is the first mouse ve enjoyed using that wasn wired this works much better than the old battery opperated ones and has much longer battery life 
neutral,this is based on this exact unit was going to return it but was to busy in the time frame have the same unit purchased from someone else and the sound quality is better and the way it runs is better this unit cuts out often out of nowhere with full charge and the sound quality is worse than the other charge green that we own
neutral,nice quality 
positive,update changed my review from five stars to stars it stills holds charge but the num lock keeps turning off and when hit it it makes me push the key about four times before it turns on again and now it has huge lag have only had it couple weeks and it is starting to take crap holds charge can shut it off at night and can also plug it in my computer to charge and still use it love it super quiet keys 
positive,got to say that am fan of these speakers bought of them after hearing friends charge and was sold on the sound out of the box these fired up and pumped out the jams extremely easy to use and link together looking forward to getting these out in the beach 
positive,amazing headset the sound is amazing better than expected for great price thank you
positive,nice and smooth nice to just connect to pc to charge and not get batteries itd be cool if they had software to control the lightsit goes into standby mode super fast not negative or positive trait 
neutral,does not come off his head 
positive,great sound and battery life definitely worth the purchase 
positive,i liked that it had mic for gaming and the sound quality was superb 
positive,this keyboard is amazing it came well packaged like high quality item and feel like the little details matter when buying product love the extra effort they made with the thick papered high quality small envelope that had decals and stuff in it the leds are bright and the keys are very quite it also has holes in the bottom which is nice if you accidentally spill something on it it has great wireless range my desktop is hooked up to my tv and the couch is about ft away and has no connection problems overall this is an amazing value for the low price and ll continue buying from this company as expand my home business into larger business 
positive,the sleekness of it and the colors loved it for work 
positive,overall this is great speaker it clear loud and pretty user friendly the battery seems to be pretty good at volume or less but close to the top of the volume range it really lacks in battery life when have it at charge and volume it will barely last me getting ready in the morning probably takes me minutes 
positive,very easy to connect to your device sounds is great with great bass gets very loud and is good for outdoor settings
positive,i love my speaker got it days ago will update yalll
positive,great sound quality portability and batter life for the price very easy to swith between bluetooth devices 
positive,great little speaker good sound for the size 
neutral,great for about day then broke stopped working all together beware of these headphones
neutral,excelente
positive,bought for use with my ps works great good sound quality
positive,this keyboard is excellent would buy it again use it for gaming have no complaints in that regard have set up where my pc is in another separate room from my bedroom it connected to my tv via foot hdmi power cables even through the wall it still manages to get good reception with minimal lag occasionally if positioned really far away in my bedroom on my bed rather than in my gaming chair it will have some brief noticeable lag but if turn it off turn it on again it goes back to normal this issue won be problem for most people since they will likely be in the same room as their pc don want to don like the noise however small that any pc makes the biggest issue have with this keyboard is the sound it makes when the rgb is on it this high pitched squealing sound it goes away as soon as the rgb is turned off this isn problem for me since don care about rgb one bit and prefer to have it off so it saves battery but everytime the keyboard turns on the rgb is automatically on and hence the sound is immediately there when turn it on and have to turn it off everytime which is minor inconvenience then again probably have to do turn it off anyways since turn off the lighting to save battery but the sound is noticeable it not as loud as computer fan or anything but since it high pitched you won not notice it 
neutral,its really sleek and easy to use it can be used with almost any thing including phone 
neutral,very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn work all other buttons worked thou
neutral,the kids really love them the fact that they are waterproof is essential don know enough features so can detail that but am considering getting one for myself 
positive,this mouse is really useful for my laptop and it was really easy to sey up the style and color of the mouse really matches the description 
positive,bought for my son th birthday he loves it great sound quality and battery lasts forever definitely worth the money 
positive,love it
positive,i purchased this mouse because was tired of having to uninstall and re install bluetooth mouse was using this mouse is very responsive fits nicely in my small hand and is an excellent buy for the price the battery lasts and turns itself off after no use for awhile 
positive, months into using this mouse it can stay charged and can barely track it works okay still doesn track well when plugged in but wanted cordless mouse for reason definitely don recommend this one 
negative,bought for use with xbox hard to get connected but that blame lies squarely with microsoft 
neutral,excelente quality sound and battery life 
positive,very nice super good quality for the price quite soft as well 
positive,got it for my wife she seems to like it it looks nice and feels good in hand 
positive,great product
neutral,the wires are flimsy around the audio jack and mic jack to the point that you have to adjust them specific way to get sound to come out of both sides of the headset accidently move the wire and you have to try to readjust it 
positive,the bass is good and the battery is amazing much better than charge the only thing that makes me feel bad is charge only have one driver on the right side which made the sound not even distribute from the speaker 
positive,i probably should have known but the light is either red or it cycles through colors this is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids would rather be able to pick color but that is not feature available which is probably something should have expected but was being hopeful 
positive,pro solid build and good looking sound quality good microphone worked as advertised and meet my expectations reasonable price con bulky for kid under years old but ok for adult usb light needed adapter not included but don use it so not big deal 
positive,got this as gift he loved it 
positive,very good quality and great price great for gaming and talking to fellow gamers 
neutral,the sound quality far exceeds the price of the speaker battery life is exceptional and the bluetooth connectivity could not be easier highly recommend this speaker 
neutral,cant wait to use it 
positive,this mouse is light and fits in my hand well it fun to watch the colors slowly change however it does not stayed charged long at all and cannot be used while it is charging 
positive,very nice headset for gamers it is extremely comfortable for long periods of use itbworks great with my ps as well 
neutral,liked it lot until it stopped working after only using it intermittently for couple months no longer will right click
neutral,smooth operation 
neutral,all went well with the first day of use 
neutral,after few months of use obviously past the return window the scroll wheel on the mouse does not track any scrolls and spins almost like wheel on skateboard the led also stopped working if were to purchase again it would have to be considerably less with the frequency have to buy them 
positive, love the fact that this thing is quiet as mouse lol hate the clicking sound on other mouses the other thing love is that it rechargeable no batteries the only con could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse that the only reason why gave it stars 
neutral,buenisimo
positive,so far so good great sound and have no trouble pairing two of them together 
positive,works well enough sleep mode is not great it really goes to sleep and the charge does not hold for days but again well works well enough if you re looking for kinda cool mouse aesthetically this will work the gray is gorgeous 
positive,i got these because they were inexpensive and they had to be better than the headset that was using have been playing more video games with my friends lately and these work perfect they are comfy and just what needed 
positive,this wireless mouse is good size with great compatibility with my mac it great price and color matches my cover highly recommend for those that just need an everyday mouse 
positive,love how soft and quiet it is super happy 
positive,my child who is an avid gamer just unboxed it and it does not work waste of money will be returning 
positive,the usb plug broke after one use plugged it into my chromebook usb port and when went to remove it the metal stayed in the laptop super disappointed was so happy with it up until that point cheaply made unfortunately the mouse itself was cute colors were nice but when it wireless the usb plug has to be good quality or it useless 
neutral,kept skipping wouldn track properly although right next to ipad
negative,the color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty the scroll wheel on the mouse is made from cheap rubbery silicone material and is completely crooked it also did not have good feel when testing it out not smooth and feels like it take lot of extra pressure to operate than others not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned 
positive,i love how they light up and great background sound canceling 
positive,use it lot listening to music on social media sometimes can be little muddy in sound but that may be the audio system from the social media site otherwise very satisfied there may be larger brands out there at much cheaper prices than the jbl advertising strong bass but the tonal quality of these cheaper speakers is not that great 
negative,received this in end of july already dead no longer charges nothing 
neutral,i like that you can charge your phone while you listen to music 
neutral,cute
positive,fits my son perfectly he loves the lights and loves this headset 
neutral,i liked the color and the lights but unfortunately the scroll wheel went out on me this item only lasted me little over months 
positive,it jus dies really quick but mabye that cuz leave it on and walk away cuz when done using it like to walk back into my room with it still on but otherwise love it
neutral,mouse was just ok the usb adapter didn work at all junk parts 
positive,i like the adjustable backlighting the way the keys feel and how quiet they are most of all like the klim technical support had trouble coordinating the chroma keyboard with the blaze mouse because of interference klim responded very quickly and their very first suggestion worked appreciate quality products and just as importantly prompt friendly and effective technical support 
positive,this is very comfortable headset with good sound quality 
positive,battery and sound is amazing and love it cuz it waterproof 
neutral,i like it
positive,seemed to work well and not muffled compared to my old speaker think most if not all of the reviewed have been accurate about the functionality able to connect well with any phone and no problems so far only had for short time 
positive,the headset was great for my year old boy
neutral,works like it should 
positive,way better than expected but still amazing speaker can change my phone don turn the vol to the max because want life of the speaker we go camping lot so far it lasted good hrs of nonstop music play vol medium high and did good along with charge two iphones xr and xs can complain at all 
negative,poor quality difficult to replace battery
positive,loud sounds great super easy to connect bluetooth lasts long time between charges love this so much 
neutral,the sound quality on these is absolutely terrible for gaming tried them with music as well also terrible the volume wheel is upside down backwards the mic is worthless and not working properly the led lights are worthless for gaming on anything other than pc it is one cord with very small split at the end one to go into the controller and the other is usb for the lights to work but you can use the lights and play on the ps or xbox at the same time which makes these pretty pointless in that aspect there is no noise cancelation whatsoever out of would not recommend these look and sound nice when you read the description and reviews but they are absolute trash wouldn even buy them for my kids 
positive,when buying gaming gear you got to look at the price for this pricepoint this keyboard is easily stars responsive great for typing battery lasts for days gaming on budget definitely worth it only con is the layout of the enter key but once you get used to it it fine 
positive,i love it
positive,my granddaughter wanted this wireless mouse for her computer it is silent when clicking she likes that the colors change on the side when using it overall she is happy with it 
negative,i was excited for this headset but as soon as hooked it up noticed sound only comes out of the left earpiece the right side has no sound don waste your money on this headset 
positive,works great charges fast with cool lighting
neutral,very satisfied with product the sound quality battery life extremely durable 
neutral,the mouse feels great in your hand is delightfully colorful but doesn scroll down the page was only able to click down which is bothersome on web pages would return it but threw out the box if you don get defective one its good buy for the price 
positive,with the price was skeptical but this mouse really does work well as soon as plugged in the usb it took all of second before could start using it the clicks are smooth and quiet and it feels great ergonomically the lights also look really good highly recommend it 
positive,ear holes are little small am over feet though other than that it perfect for what need 
neutral,its amazing bought it for my dad so he can see the keyboard but end up gaming on it instead
positive,this head set is very good it is very comfortable on my head and it good for gaming
positive,great sounds bluetooth connectivity is soo easy
neutral,stopped working few weeks after purchase 
positive,this mouse is great quality and duration is excellent this mouse goes uncharged for months while being university student realize recently it have been giving little problem hopefully the seller can assist with this great but otherwise
positive,ok so love my new keyboard however there is one thing that is going to drive me crazy aside from by phone watch am terrible about having to recharge things am using this keyboard for work and it died on me twice it definitely my bad but still never had to worry about recharging keyboard before so if you are like me you may want to reconsider otherwise no complaints 
neutral,cool looking mouse and dazzling light colors 
neutral,worth it 
neutral,like others have reported the mouse curser jumps around and blinks after short min period of use making it difficult to control and sometimes nonresponsive you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it over the weekend thinking the battery was not fully charged but the same results this morning have requested refund and will be purchasing something that works 
positive,great sound goes anywhere and is easy to use
positive,would love it if it held charge or had backup space for battery have to constantly charge this usually every two days in the middle of my work day im over it going to go back to battery mouse 
neutral,it works okay but my scrool wheel doesn work and it never jad
neutral,more technical trash
positive,functions exactly as described love it 
negative,absolutely terrible the adapter doesn stay in the computer the mouse doesn charge not single good thing about it
negative,i initially really enjoyed this mouse it is good size the battery life is reasonable and sucker for anything that lights up rainbow do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being constant red light however after using the mouse for less than months the scroll wheel stopped working and can figure out why ve tried cleaning it out recharging the battery and adjusting my driver settings with no luck definitely frustrated and because my return window has past not sure how to reach out to customer service 
neutral,they didn light up disappointing for my little guy 
negative,i ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen even when it was fully charged figured just got bad apple so made an exchange for new one the new mouse came scratched not big deal and the scroll wheel wasn as smooth annoying but its fine but this one cursor is jumping around the screen too would have otherwise liked the mouse it charges up quickly and appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer 
positive,connected quickly to my phone will be my speaker for my long drive moving across states love the battery life and the sound quality is good recommend 
positive,these are amazing love how they look and how well they work for what need great sound quality and nice mic 
neutral,very pleased 
positive,got them early and they are beautiful they have great sound for the money
neutral,she uses them every day for her xbox and on her chromebook
neutral,works very well
positive,i love how long it is has lasted and the way it feels 
neutral,the kids like them for minecraft 
negative,totally deceptive they raised the price what joke nothing makes me more mad than when company puts american flags all over their listing and the label on the box says made in china why because this is deceptive marketing even if the box didnt say this how do know because the letter key didnt work and the power switch was stuck immediate return do not buy 
negative,i received of these for christmas they both stopped working within the first weeks of having them emailed customer service as they tell you to and never got response emailed them twice junky and waste of money for the purchaser who gifted them to me 
neutral,keys are very clickety loud and the space bar literally squeaks battery charge doesn last long and cuts out completely with no warning is not functional while charging plugged into the computer otherwise suppose it functional backlighting is nice to have though sure it drains the battery more quickly no obvious way to turn that feature off when not needed 
positive,amazing headphones not too bulky sounds great and my son loves it 
neutral,this is great headset really cups the ears and cancels the outside sounds
positive,the sound quality is great mic tested fine the quality of the materials seems bit cheap though the cushion for the top of the head was bit minimal the ear muffs were bit small and did not really provide sufficient room for your ears to be comfortably inside them my ears were aching hurting within hours of wearing the headphones if you re kid these will probably work out great for you an adult pass em up 
neutral,when my friend received the headset the jack is bent so now how has to adjust the port and not plug it all the way to hear both side of the headphone 
positive,i teacher so don want to be attached to my computer at the front the whole day this mouse keeps good charge allows me to walk around my class the whole time stays attached to me the colors just add bit of fun to it 
positive,very basic mouse rechargeable battery that lasts awhile great for just needing simple wireless option at good price 
positive,perfect mouse silently working
negative,doesn hold charge for very long has dead spots have to shake to get to move sometime
positive,excellent product works right out the box
positive,has good sound for portable speaker bluetooth hooks up good works great for golf carts 
positive,given to wife as gift she loves it 
positive,great product 
neutral,no charger cord for what we pay there should be
neutral,it was good for the three days before it diedbad product or quality control at least it was not expensive 
positive,i think they sound fine they were pretty nice and do the job at great price
neutral,does it exactly what it should do 
neutral,it not working lato problem typing
positive,awesome bass tested this speaker at my local electronics store and then bought it here didnt test the waterproof ability cause generally rather not do that satisfied 
negative,literally bought it today it connected at first and upon turning it off after and turning it on it did not want to connect at all gave it full charge and the battery only lasted up for min very disappointed
neutral,everything was good except the mic can talk for some reason ve tried everything the mic needs to be tweaked 
positive,my grandson really enjoys it 
neutral,the sound is horrible wish could return it 
neutral,really like the size of this speaker big sound in compact size 
positive,great product shipped fast and was ready right out the box also comes with the adapter which is nice since didn have to buy it 
positive,for the price it great it not too silent on the clicking but it ok still love it 
positive,love how soft and quiet it is super happy 
neutral,the product fits well in my hand and has quiet click but it keeps on cutting out will walk away for minute and the mouse does not work anymore so have to unplug it turn it off then back on and replug it in 
positive,i got this keyboard because my computer is not under direct light and at night it difficult or impossible to see what you re typing can use this in the dark and it only stays lit when in use so it not glowing all day long the rainbow colors are pretty only wish it had volume button you can push fn function but would have liked just and up down mute feature somewhere 
positive,i love the jbl speaker so much it works so good and just love it all around it very great speaker the connectivity is little slow but that doesn stop me from listening to my jams 
positive,love this mouse for my laptop glad chose this one not only is it comfortable slim and sleek in my palm but love the rotating fun colors that it emits which can also be turned off for the single color mode 
neutral,its cute and comfortable but tracks too slowly for gaming
positive,just what needed and like the colors real sleek in hand
neutral,playing music when out in the yard
positive,great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic perfect for the bag that has just enough space when you re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly it sleep mode feature is nice adage increasing battery life and usability as far as gaming goes would recommend only lite casual games only not for gaming on the heavy side overall would buy again
neutral,update downgrading from stars to jbl has terrible customer service at best if you have questions no one will help this comes with usb cord only nothing to charge to wall outlet if you want to hear text message sound notification through your speaker forget it the original jbl charge does allow message sound notifications you have to have your phone next to you constantly which totally defeats the purpose it step back will be returning this very disappointed 
neutral,batterylife not good
positive,so have kids and they all homeschool don have an office but do both work and school myself at home with the kids all around me these seem to get everything done was hoping for they are quiet enough inside to ignore the kids when needed the mic does cancel out the computer games being played right next to me while on skype call on amazon it did specifically say it did not come with mm audio adapter for slitting the mic and headphone jack locations but mine did show up with set so the ones ordered in addition are no longer needed find them comfortable they were an easy plug and play type set up the only thing that can specifically comment on one way or another is longevity as have only gotten them today 
neutral,cable quit charging mouse after one charge 
positive,i am not using it for gaming but think its cute and love the colors just wish it was little bighter 
positive,used for gaming colours could be little bit brighter on the keyboard overall good product 
neutral,nice sound
positive,as with several other reviews here the one purchased lasted several months until it just stopped tracking mid swipe thought maybe it just needed recharge as that what it has done in the past when forgot to charge it overnight but no it more like it just shorted out works for swipe and click and then stops again kinda sucks because it really cool and fun mouse with the led lights and the charging vs batteries guess ll look now to see if the warranty will help girl out 
neutral,nice headset
negative,it cool mouse the led features are nice and it pretty but hate when have to move it sporadically for good seconds before the mouse moves on the screen ve tried different mouse pads and it still happens it extremely frustrating and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it you have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now it also makes an irritating high pitched noise when you move it 
positive,great headset clear sound 
neutral,this mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it not sure what went wrong but it just gave out and that was it 
neutral,not for regular or big hands
neutral,cheap easy to use and keeps up with your needs
positive,bose who why spend so much money on bose or these other brands was bose fan for most my life all my vehicles and sound systems in all my vehicles added the bose sound package the only speaker actually believe puts out better and louder sound quality for less than half the price let alone the battery life and the charging abilities over hrs of battery life and includes power back built in to hook up your cell phone or even alexa to play your tunes best speaker for the price would have spent even more on it 
positive,i updating this review received keyboard that stopped charging month after bought it contacted the company and their customer service was amazing and they sent me new one quickly so far my new one works great which so happy about because really enjoy this keyboard 
neutral,mine was broken when got it
neutral,was nice until it stopped working after only few weeks wouldn buy this again not worth the money 
positive,i got this as gift for my husband for christmas and couldn be happier for this has good set of lights and it comes with built in battery that charges via usb my husband loves it and at it was steal and customer for life now the only minor thing about this is that it sleeps little too fast but any key waking it up makes that almost null 
neutral,owned jbl for years before it died and played it full volume hours each day didn even think about different brand 
neutral,bought in february already stopped working have headset stand that place them on when done using so it not like they re tossed aside and it not like use them every day either eta customer service sent replacement very nice to work with
positive,pretty good so far no complaints
positive,i bought this because hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when need it it charges by plugging it into the laptop but haven had to do that yet besides giving it full charge when opened it up the first time it does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took minute to figure out but once you realize that it not broken just asleep it all good overall it just basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable 
neutral,i have purchased charge in and received charge for some reason checked the receipt to double check that didn accidentally buy so now have spent an extra bucks on speaker that did not order 
negative,one night your headphones break and you check amazon for new pair of cheap headphones you may stumble across pair of nice looking headphones which are only and whopping discount trust me there is reason these nightmare bengoo are more than half off you may think these headphones look legit but once you plug them into your controller all hell breaks loose not only will the legendary bengoos lodge out of your controller about times per minute if you are ever in gaming party want to say good luck to the other soldiers in that chat they may think you just bought new pair of nice headphones but little do they know they are about to enter the midst of modern war fare multiplayer lobby the sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos mirror the sound of precision air strike happening in the mic one would assume you are in the middle of war if you are ever thinking of acquiring pair of bengoo headphones make sure you don have any friends because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in game chat am warning you now once you acquire bengoo the rest is on you good sir 
negative,great for the first year but even last longer than this thing does pathetic 
neutral,not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse have ever had the displeasure of holding the usb type adapter is loose fitting piece of junk not even worth the hassle of returning this piece of garbage only flashes red for second then quits doing anything else even after being charged for hours have attached it to different devices and nothing guess you get what you pay for and this instance junk
negative,bought this for my son to use for school the roller bar broke the second time he used it in addition to this it wouldn stay charged dissatisfied customer 
neutral,when this stops working looks like you re stuck no offer on replacement just purchased and already busted do not buy seriously not bot real review don listen to the star reviews not noise cancelling mic doesn work not even good sound quality well only bright side is if you write bad review then they ll refund you this is the only reason moved this from star to still don recommend purchasing
positive,sound is awesome and it pairs well with devices
neutral,bought this in january and only use it tops two days week and it stopped working 
positive,we love it we can type in dark room and it so pretty 
neutral,its cute and comfortable but tracks too slowly for gaming
neutral,producers started out great then months in and the mic stopped working and headset stopped connecting to the xbox waste of money 
positive,amazing product the noise cancelling is very impressive
positive,i ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way the scroller do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful won be buying third one but if that not gonna be problem for you then these will probably be great they hold charge well and the light show they put on is really cool 
negative,the design is pretty but the functionality is crappy my mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the nd floor last week 
positive,perfect just perfect
neutral,scroll wheel broke after very light use would not recommend would have been nice mouse otherwise 
negative,when received this item it was thin which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side then simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered and to stop it off sometimes the cursor goes everywhere which can be annoying when you re working on particular items love it for the lights and how compact it is handle this item with care 
neutral,i was naive and thought wireless meant bluetooth but it doesn make sure you read everything carefully the colours change really smoothly though 
neutral,mouse not working properly 
positive,i always wanted wireless mouse but did not buy one because though about the amount of batteries would go through decided to give this one try and just have to say wow charged it for the first time on for two hour like the instructions indicated and as of today it is still going strong mind you work from home and use this mouse hour day monday through saturday have not had to recharge it at all it works so smoothly and it automatically goes to sleep when not in use am super happy with it 
neutral,they lasted months and then the microphone broke 
neutral,the sounds not so good but loud enough my main issue was connection to my computer speaker had to restart my computer whenever change from my bluetooth ear phone to this speaker 
neutral,i was excited for this mouse and it worked well up until now ve only had this mouse for two months already stopped working and ve only used it times don recommend buying too late to get my refund and that sucks 
negative,the product broke no sound called to trouble shoot was told by amazon it was sold by third party seller and to contact them the only contact is link to the instruction manual very frustrated save your money and do not buy 
neutral,product stinks
positive,this mouse is so cute the chip is little challenging to get out but works amazing and the colors are adorable
neutral,too expensive
positive,so bought two different mouse to use one for my laptop and one for my pc the originally bought this one for my desktop to match my rgb but enjoy using it with my laptop much better it is the perfect size for my hand you cannot go wrong at this price for what you get enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel 
neutral,it works well
neutral,charged it for hours and hours and could never pair with my mac used the adaptor that was included and tried multiple times but was never able to use it definitely not easy to pair as it advertised 
positive,i love the quiet click no more obnoxious loud clicking 
neutral,nice and quiet not as sensitive as like but it works
positive,nice feel and touch fits the hands properly hopefully there will be type upgrade to these things
neutral,there is an input delay when you press key it takes half second to actually register which can make huge difference in professional gaming 
positive,sound quality and battery life are amazing love connecting with other jbl products for better surround sound quality
positive,best quality speaker 
neutral,good recomend this keyboard 
positive,haven done many reviews but think this one was worth the time have hands that are bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area haven used the mouse for gaming but also haven had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too overall if you are looking for wireless mouse good for work and home use with good connectivity highly recommend this mouse 
positive,i don consider myself an audiophile by any means but know what like connectivity with my sony nw was snap and the sound quality was quite surprise it was rich full sound and did not detect any distortion played everything from bocelli through journey bon jovi jason aldean and queen it all sounded great to me love this speaker 
positive,the overall sound quality is nice and loud indoors but when outside the sound doesn travel as far as you would think but for the size of the speaker was really impressed with the output overall when paired with nd device got the sound needed and wanted outdoors this is great product the portability is amazing because of the size and the durability is awesome 
positive,set back light to high but wish would be brighter 
positive,this thing is awesome the range for the bluetooth is way far better than anything ve had before mean got over clear line of site and it was still crystal clear would highly recommend 
positive,this is the first fancy keyboard ve bought and it worth it use it mainly for my tv when connect my laptop to it the range seems to be pretty far too 
positive,slim profile love that it doesn need battries colorful 
positive,great for party
positive,the mouse was very easy to setup had instructions on charging on the mouse itself would definitely recommend great on the price as well 
neutral,for gaming
neutral,the mouse is comfortable to use notice while using it there is bit of lag would recommend if the slim design is what you are looking for would not recommend for gaming use it for work 
positive,pretty cool devise easy to install no instructions needed
neutral,for computer use into the evening hours very nice and functional to have lighted keyboard 
positive,the connection from mouse to laptop isn constant the sleep function is convenient but the mouse doesn have good reaction time had to really press down on the left click for the mouse to do anything 
neutral,i like the size and the fact don have to change betteries
positive,this product is amazing
neutral,since live in the remote rainforest always keep backups of necessary items like keyboards bought this keyboard several months ago and stored it in it original packaging until needed it two days ago my current keyboard malfunctioned so got this one out of the box to use and the key mostly doesn work at all or it puts double or triple letters am now stuck for about month until can get new one very disappointed 
negative,worked until it needed to be charged after charging it worked sporadically and needed to be charged everyday need to be able to use my mouse everyday not wait for it to be charged 
neutral,constantly lags or just stops working while trying to type even when the battery is full 
neutral,unfortunately bluetooth cuts out the audio high frequencies for portable bluetooth speaker this is great my daughter enjoys listening to her music while in the shower speaker outside the shower but isn harmed by the humidity 
positive,i love this mouse and can wait to get another one just like it use this one at work and it very comfortable and not loud clicking either 
negative,this keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting but the connectivitiy is garbage it makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag you will put in an input and it will take few seconds to register if it registers at all there is also no indicator if it is about to die fully charged it still lags 
positive, this is so amazing recommend 
positive,sounds great fast shipping actually arrived early easy to connect to and control from device or phone 
neutral,the center scroll wheel lasted less than week the mouse itself still works but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with wheel that doesn work decent battery life bought new different brand mouse to replace it the mouse also doesn have much of an arch to it so its not very ergonomic its better than laptop track pad though 
neutral,this mouse looks good but that it it works poorly finally gave up and went back to my old wired mouse it just doesn work well you end up wildly moving it around and getting the cursor to where you want it to click on something is struggle would not recommend this mouse 
positive,i like the fact that it micro usb instead of swapping aaa battery and it very light weight and soft and easy to use
neutral,i was really happy to use this mouse it light weight and really liked the color changing light however had it month and the wheel use to scroll up and down stopped working so basically it useless 
positive,battery last great for kid to use 
neutral,rechargeable 
neutral,nice
neutral,this didn last months before it stopped taking charge will not be buying another one 
positive,perfect for gaming and noise cancellation
neutral,wireless connectivity is pretty bad my keyboard is on desk ft away from my tower which is on the ground if shift the keyboard too far it will result in loss of keystroke recognition connectivity will be intermittent will most likely return this one 
positive,son loved them except they wouldn work with his playstation
positive,my son loves his keyboard customer service through klm is available and very thorough and helpful if needed 
positive,i really enjoyed these gaming headphones they are so comfortable to fit my large head and the sound quality is awesome the price is such great deal also making this an awesome pair of headphones to use when playing games or doing talks at work 
neutral,poor battery life need to charge daily
neutral,i charged this brand new mouse and used it only for two weeks after the second week it stopped functioning what garbage

positive,i love this mouse it fit feels great in my hand on the computer lot so that is important to me love the colors as you can tell by my mouse pad love colors it easy and fast to wake it great don have negative thing to say 
neutral,works well light weight
positive,my sister was very happy with her present and loves the sound 
neutral,i had to return this because it did not connect and the signal was constantly lost finally got my money back after weeks 
positive,fits in my big hands nicely with the mouse wheel having non sleep feel bought two of these one for my work laptop and one for my personal laptop not too long afterwards one of the bt dongles went awol the seller sent me replacement which for me sealed the deal as good investment purchase of course the led colors were icing on the cake so to speak 
positive,okay performance while it worked but definitely won buy it again and would not recommend it to others 
neutral,very loud with every click 
positive,this headset is one of the best have gotten for my son very good sound with noise cancel hes pretty rough on his things and these are sturdy enough that they have held up nicely love these

positive,great sound quality good battery life easy to connect little heavier and bigger than was expecting 
positive,i am very happy with this keyboard really like the quiet keys it comfortable and it works great the lights in the keyboard create nice atmosphere you can find the usb port and on and off switch on the underside of the keyboard 
positive,i bought these because play games with my husband and other friends and family needed something better than the headset was using this headset is so much better wear glasses and it comfortable so it doesn hurt my ears while wear them the sound is good and can finally hear understand people when they talk lastly people can hear me better also the mic being on the left side is added bonus my husband sits on my left side while we game and doesn always use mic himself and it able to pick up his ramblings so other people can hear him even without him having mic 
positive,love this mouse and the fact it goes to sleep of forget to turn it off even better don have to worry about batteries 
neutral,noice headset duds
neutral,gift for grandson for gaming
negative, works well until it goes into sleep mode when you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around the only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on which seems minuscule but it gets really annoy the longer you use it maybe just got defective one it got some really high marks but buyer beware video shows it being woken up then turn it off on and it works fine 
positive,sounds amazing and battery is great 
positive,i love how fast it connects and how cute it looks
positive,let me start with what everyone is most interested in these have great sound quality for the size they have better bass than you expect but the treble could be little stronger ve turned the volume way up just to see how they handle the power and they hold up well you can blast them without worry as long as you have good source material bought so could output in stereo it bit quirky trying to get them into stereo mode but it does work however for some reason they glitch occasionally which causes dropout when playing in stereo think it has to do with the bluetooth communication between speakers hoping they can come up with firmware update to fix it don have this problem when just using speaker all in all would recommend buying these 
neutral,very quiet nice lighting
neutral,this worked for two days and then it broke
positive,i love the jbl speaker hassle free when it comes to pairing it to my phone the sound quality is amazing as well as the sleek look have had better battery life with other speakers but overall great purchase 
neutral,i ve had this keyboard for while and it finally ran out of battery to my surprise it doesn charge at all tried different chargers and nothing works spend little more and get product that doesn just die forever the first time it runs out of juice 
neutral,great headset but no usb on remote to use the light feature
negative,sound quality was so bad just bought razer you get stars automatically if have to use two in between wires engineering genius lets add more jacks usb which is the weakest link of every headphone in existence honestly you might as well pay for wireless then all this chinese crap that is gonna break in few months of wear and tear 
neutral,the charge port messed up not even month later super disappointed
neutral,it took one week of using this mouse before deciding to just get better quality mouse 
positive,i like to keep office lights turned down depending on task at hand and appreciate the illuminated keys this is just for my personal office use would actually prefer the option to use battery power but charging by usb now and then is fine personally was looking for keyboard with larger letters as my eyesight has gotten worse but sny option saw was wired not offered as wireless would also have preferred all one color but for my personal use this is rather pretty 
negative,don buy this thought it would be convenient not to have to worry about replacing batteries was wrong used it one day and it hasn held charge since huge waste of money 
neutral,doesn hold charge long
positive,kids love it they use it to play on ps the sound quality is good and like that the headphones light up 
negative,after two months of non regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it own and now feels somewhat loose when touched was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies 
positive,perfect
positive,this works great for gaming and normal pc games check out our youtube channel northwoods peach tree
neutral,we bought this for my son to use and it lasted months before the scrolling wheel broke 
neutral,i thought this mouse was gonna work really good and last long time based on the reviews unfortunately the charger that came with the mouse isn charging the mouse tried everything to get it to work and would not the mouse worked for few hours before dying on me not good purchase and not satisfied with their product 
positive,it not quite as good as some of the high end headsets for comfort and noise canceling but it does good job at everything else definitely good value for the money spent 
neutral,nice mouse but have had other rechargeable and this one seriously lacks uptime getting about few days and dies quickly my first one would last weeks but lost it at conference should have went back to it 
neutral,the mouse looks great feels great but didn get more than few hours out of it before it died left it plugged in for several hours but it doesn stay on anymore despite several recharge attempts it just doesn turn on anymore 
positive,works great son loves it
neutral,works
positive,it bit bulky but find hear clearly like that it has volume button have it for months now and it hasn broken yet although it does feel bit wobbly like it could break if you re not caref with it the microphone could be longer so others can hear you more clearly
positive,i liked it very much it was product wanted and the sound quality is very good 
neutral,these stop working after short while bought they all have been returned spend couple bucks more and buy different unit
neutral,only have had this mouse for months and already have to replace it the charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging the port is wobbling around not making contact to charge going back to battery operated wireless mouse 
neutral,good quaility for price
negative,light weight ergonomic bought on died on impossible to recharge
neutral,lasted months
neutral,this mouse worked one time and hasn worked since have tried charging it and flipping it to different settings it lights up and that is all that it does 
neutral,i use for work only last about hours battery not like it specifies
neutral,this product is not worth the money it stopped working all together after and months 
neutral,stopped working within month won charge light comes on and goes right out bought plan on sending the other one back still in the box 
neutral,the headset works of the time don waste your time and money on this it cheap for reason 
positive,cool lights my son loves it
positive,the mouse doesn work the reason they have good ratings is because they ask you to rate star and promise refund don buy 
positive,love it
positive, sooo this thing is so cute for starters it light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily the buttons aren hard and actually it easier to click on different things only negatives have when it goes into sleep mode have to turn it on and off and the second thing is pro and con for me the usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy just wish it had latch release had to use card to pop it out other than those things it great didn even have to charge it when took it out the box 
neutral,product doesn stay connected
positive,it very comfortable to use minimal noise
neutral,not actually wireless in the way mac users need it still requires port for dongle which makes it not mac compatible
neutral,i have been using this for less than month and it doesn work it doesn hold charge 
neutral,works well
neutral,i have weird situation with my speaker everything works fine except that it doesnt allow me to turn it off whenever you try to turn it off it goes off for some sec and turns on by itself have try several troubleshooting steps and still the same 
neutral,does what its meant for
neutral,skips around and freezes when clicking on things save your money 
neutral,mouse stop working after couple of days feel cheap got what paid for always felt like was holding the wrong end of the mouse 
negative,don bother even thinking about purchasing this item it terrible does not connect to anything very cheap looking the color doesn match the description the seller is little suspicious too tried giving me refund with fake amazon gift card 
positive,bought exchanged immediately due to sent broken one recieved replacement works sometimes won always work the other original purchase scrolly ball won register any movent good for months if you get one that works properly from the start 
neutral,i bought this to replace my regular keyboard with no backlit this works well the only problem is the charging cable is too short will need to use another cable otherwise it does what it supposed to 
positive,this headset works well it decent quality the sound is good they definitely aren noise canceling but that doesn bother me overall glad bought this 
neutral,could not get it to work 
positive,great sound quality amazing battery and lightweight 
neutral,the first one they sent me was defective out of the box klim was good enough to just send me replacement obviously this must be common issue the keyboard misses when am in the flow of typing consequently keep typing passwords incorrectly to the point have to type them in notepad then copy and paste to ensure don get accounts locked or make error after error and have to type extremely slow to ensure each key is picked up the keyboard is unreliable don buy it full stop bought the keyboard in august black friday is tomorrow so this keyboard is getting replaced 
positive,love this mouse purchased the mint green for laptop works great so far dongle was tight to remove but that ok lights change color make sure to put it on the setting that looks like sun otherwise on position will leave lights on red it was delivered when it was expected 
neutral,bigger than other speakers we have had but that is plus choice of colors was an added plus since everyone has black or white it seems
neutral,it meets my need 
positive,the colors are great the charging time is great and the battery life is great unfortunately this is quite difficult to type on and feels extremely cheap the old saying you get what you pay for comes to mind 
positive,alright purchased this product about years ago and it has gotten regular use over all for what it is it is good product for good price do wish there was an option to dim or turn off the led lights when using the keyboard but that fairly small issue my one frustration is this there is no place on the keyboard to store the wireless dongle the slot it comes packaged in is just rectangular hole in the back of the board with tape over it once it is unpackaged and getting used regularly not having place to lock the dongle in to the keyboard when transporting it creates risk of losing the tiny little bt dongle which is exactly what happened to me when moved my home office so was without use of this keyboard for about weeks the good news is that when contacted klim they were happy to mail out new dongle free of charge in fact the first one they sent got lost in the mail so they happily sent second replacement free as well and tracked the package this time so the product is middle of the road and could use some engineering improvements but it worth the money and more importantly the customer service is star 
positive,love it for my work from home job very ergonomic and smooth 
neutral,casual use 
neutral,it quit working after weeks
positive,love this mouse mouse came days before delivery eta which was always nice love that it rechargeable no more dead batteries mid work shift mouse connected right away to my thinkpad ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome mouse is low profile with really nice feel to it tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for longevity so far it for me do note with the white version the colors bleed through the top as you can see in the picture and video however still looks cool to me just different than the advertised photos 
positive,highly recommend this is the rd jbl speaker ve purchased my kids are hard on them and leave these in the shower take to practice sleepovers and throw around in our golf cart got great deal no complaints great sound quality and durable recommend 
positive,the headset is really comfortable it feels natural on the head my friends can hear me really well when play and hear them just fine you can hear what going on out side the headset but not real well use it for gaming and really like it over all really good headset 
positive,beautiful
neutral,very good
positive,the headset goes hard it was on the more budget end but feels sturdy and came with an excellent chord adapters the sound quality is good and the mic pickup fairs well this product is an excellent choice 
neutral,easy to pack and go 
positive,great item kids love it
neutral,use traveling with laptop compact and thin better than standard mini mouse
negative,the microphone is literally ass trash asf when went to go turn my mic on it didn work and tried multiple times the headset didn work either because of the jack so it trash
positive, the mouse is very bright in the dark love the aesthetic of it it very sleek and looks nice with my laptop the battery lasts pretty long it stays on red when you need to charge it love that it is rechargeable so no need for batteries 
positive,great sound especially for the money plus for any gathering indoors outside 
positive,pretty cool devise easy to install no instructions needed
neutral,stopped working in days
positive,aint the best but aint the worst either 
neutral,as described
positive,i am using mine with my gaming computer and to watch movies the noise cancelling feature is superior to my last couple of sets very satisfied 
positive,this keyboard looks good on my desk and is very good for coding 
positive,its nice mouse but not sure if its good for gaming 
positive,this keyboard is pretty cool but it doesn seem to hold up to my son gaming we had to return it for new one in the first month the second one seems to be working fine with no issues think it is not for serious gamers it will be fine at desk where it doesn get moved lot 
neutral,only one side worked
positive,used these for gaming on my pc everyone was playing with told me there was consistent background static every time cued my mic tried several different ways to correct the static from setting up the headset on the pc and updating drivers and the issue persisted the overall features of the headset were good but the static issue won work for me returned these and will be purchasing different brand 
neutral,didn work for my ps total waste of money going with turtle beach headsets for my next gaming headset purchase 
neutral,great speaker we use it on the lanai for pool music bit much on the bass out of the box but adjustable via the app can be paired with additional speakers for large area 
negative,the usb plug for the pc is totally useless as the pc will constantly complain about an unknown device plugged into the port contacted support what joke told me to return the product for another one no thank you this goes in the garbage where it belongs no quality control they sent me an email wanted to send me replacement no already threw it away as it stopped working you can buy my good review with cash or another of your defective products do not buy wish had read the customer reviews junk 
neutral,the mouse just feels odd in my hand it serviceable but when it dies not buying another 
positive,everything perfect arrived on time in perfect condition
positive,i have small hands and it feels great on it it light and pretty live that it changes colors haven used it for gaming though 
positive,for any headset as inexpensive as this headset its actually good one it didn have the best quality like what normally get but didn expect it to be very good it felt as if it was kind of crushing my head from the cheap foam earpiece and the foam piece that rests on top of your head didn make it that much better could only wear it for about minutes to an hour before hearing the pumping of my heart the audio wasn the best but it definitely isn the worst audio the mic is great and my friends said the only difference between my mic and this one was it was quieter the adjustable function for the headset is what disliked the most each time adjust it it always made loud cracking sound from the adjusters and each time felt as if was going to break or snap it in half because of how hard you have to pull to adjust the thing in all wouldn generally recommend this headset know it cheap option but have found lucid sound headsets or other main brand headsets as cheap as this one that have lot better quality than this one giving this one stars mainly because its cheap option for gaming but could easily give this since can find better options that are as cheap as this headset if you are looking for good headset that will last long time recommend corsair voids or just any more expensive headsets aiming around 
positive, when opened my mouse noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse towards the area where your palm would rest when in use also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the usb that would make the mouse compatible with my macbook so had to use different adapter considering paid for new mouse was expecting to get better quality gave the mouse second chance and this time received one that didn work 
negative,this is the second time bought this in months and the same thing happened the wire broke from the headsetreally bad quality when it comes to the wiring
neutral, if you have big hands don recommend you buying this also with the lighting really dislike it if you look at the video it goes through the mouse and you can see all the the stuff inside very disappointed overall it good and sturdy mouse just thought they could ve worked on the exterior more 
positive,love this remote the slim design fits perfectly in my hand love the changing rainbow colors and the ease of using is absolutely awesome would highly recommend this remote to anyone with pc mac laptop
neutral,it basic sleep mode is irritating 
neutral,you have to press down very hard on the mouse it gets very annoying wish still had the box return it
neutral,it is hard to use and the sensation is not good 
neutral,this mouse does seem to let you pick color and the same is not comfortable 
positive,this is very nice headset for ps the only complaint have is that it only lights up when the usb is plugged in which can be difficult when you already have stuff for gaming plugged in the sound works great being plugged into controller overall it has worked great and my son likes it would not suggest buying based on lighting up unless you have an extra usb slot to plug it into usb on ps 
neutral,sound is true stereo
positive,great
neutral,i charged it it still will not work the mouse still will not work 
neutral,i used the mouse after got it for hours and within the first minutes the light srop changing colors it is now only red 
positive,i love this mouse it easy to use when don use it for period of time it shuts off and with the click of the mouse its back on also love the changing colors 
positive,really nice keyboard its far quiet than mechanical keyboard which is what want the finger resist is slightly higher but its fine battery lasts me about week on full brightness there is not many cons so am nick picking but every time you turn off the keyboard it forgets your settings and the actual placing of the off button is unusual so just always leave it on now its really just to stop the cat walking on it anyways highly recommend it espcially if your computer doesnt have bluetooth
neutral,this is decent headset if you re using it for pc gaming there is no noise cancelation the loudest volume is not that loud to be honest the led lights needs the usb to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller you can use it for playstation or xbox but you can use led unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with usb port guess should have expected this since it wasn too expensive although for this product think the price is lot this is equivalent to dollar headset based on sound quality no noise cancelation and the led lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you re playing on playstation 
positive,the lights only work if you use the usb plug which is not practical for video consoles like xbox and playstation sound quality is pretty good but pretty standard set of headsets without the light feature 
neutral,it arrived in time the overall quality of this products is good 
positive,it has really good noise canceling very good for hearing footsteps while gaming overall great product for sound quality 
neutral,it works okay but my scrool wheel doesn work and it never jad

neutral,we purchased two of these and the scrollers broke on both of them in less than two months there was no trauma to them they re just junk 
positive,the speaker is very loud fills the room easily portable for any event the charge holds for long time makes wonderful gift my fiance absolutely loves it 
neutral,i got this mouse and charged it like it said to but when went to use it it doesn even work would not recomend anyone to get this mouse 
positive,i barely use my keyboard sit on couch and watch netflix etc aka don even use it for gaming and after like months at least the button the button don work whatsoever they say the keyboard lasts at least decade hmmmmmmm buy something else as now have to as well
neutral,on my laptop it skips doesn read about of the time making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces and it does the same no matter what 
positive,my kid loves them great quality and sound she says they are the best head set she has ever had 
positive,great mouse sleek and fun great price 
positive,i big time gamer all my friends say it sounds good on their end so it good headset for gamers plus hear them just as good 
positive,i enjoy the sound quality for the headset but please get the adapter for the xbox one controllers the headset fried controllers audio boxes unless used the adapter 
positive,i wanted to just like it mean it worked but honestly it felt like kids cheap dollar tree toy just can imagine that it will last long should have known better with the price anyway returned it 
positive,bought this item for birthday gift he been using since no problems 
neutral,some people will hate and say these are bad headphones cuz they re cheap ve been using these forever their sound quality is great and the mic quality is just as good as any other mix no need to spend hundreds on mic and headphones when you can get it for cheap 
positive,bought here for my son he loves them lights and mic work great
positive,great product the sound is amazing and the battery last all day would recommend
neutral,it was great while it lasted days before the wireless receiver failed the keyboard itself still turns on and has lights though so there is at least that going for it 
positive,i love the speaker works great wish it came with better instruction manual for all of the features 
positive,comfortable sound clear and looks nice
positive,just plug and play so easy to use and very sleek and slim looking like it when the light lid up its soo cool this is my st rechargeable mouse really like it am going to try it for month and if it work well will buy another one 
positive,keyboard was for dual purpose but one was to use for my office computer keys are nice and quiet but very responsive nice looking obnoxious glow adds little flare to my work station 
neutral,this is large speaker read the dimensions but its significantly larger than the flip series my only criticism would be that it does not really have quiet setting even the lowest it can go is still sometimes little louder than wanted that being said it sounds great can be very loud and we haven had any issues yet 
positive,i use this for work not for gaming the sound comes in and out in the left speaker but the sound quality is better than using my cell phone or computer microphone and speakers 
neutral,compact and extremely loud when needed
positive,it just great in everything good sound waterproof great bluetooth connection definitely recommend it 
positive,i bought this mouse for my work laptop the right click on the mouse is constantly getting stuck and the left click seems to take several pushes before it recognizes what it is supposed to do overall wouldn buy this again would definitely recommend spending allitle more and getting better mouse to get the job done 
positive,absolutely love it
positive,very comfortable and feels great
neutral,good
neutral,only one side works
neutral,i wanted it without the dongle

positive,the headphones work great can hear footsteps and other things clearly
neutral,this item is not what was expecting 
neutral,this is very nice product the mouse does not need pad can work on the bare desk on sheet of paper etc my device does not have multiple leds only red or the software use does not employ all its features but there is no need to complain will buy again without hesitation

positive,this is def noise cancellation always in full house and was happy not to hear noise
neutral,does it exactly what it should do 
positive,great product super comfortable and the sound is clear 
positive,great sound and design of mic 
positive,great product great sound not much difference between the new ones and got this for dollars cheaper than the new ones and it was definitely worth it 
positive,i ordered two pairs of these headphones one for me and another for my brother not even two weeks and they ve already ran their course at first they were bit tight on the head enough to give headaches if not removed after few hours this eventually eased up as the first week went on the real issue came in for us days after first using them like many others have been saying here one day the mic was fine and the next day all of sudden its quality was way lower than what it was prior audio then coming through lot more stuffy and the mic having hard time picking up any sounds at all only when cranked up the decibel settings to max it was able to pick up feint sounds one of them still works fine on our xbox but when it comes to pc they re both on the way out already will most definitely be looking elsewhere for our tech needs in the future 
positive,excelent product thanks and very funny with the instructions thanks lot
positive,my son loves it the led light only works if you use the headset with computer or laptop 
positive,good for party s
positive,so got it for my boyfriend who wanted gaming keyboard but no wire it was on time in the mail looked like it was returned item with all the tape trying to keep the box together but as it came in the original packaging it makes sense while it was plugged in we turned it on to see the lights it was very low with other lights interfering but visible at night or in darkness we left it to charge as instructed and it never charged when it was it lasted minutes at most the keyboard connected to the laptop as we saw it under the devices but it wouldn type or send any sort of input in overall wasn good buy on my part but for gift for gamer boyfriend who hage wires he liked it while it lasted 
neutral,mouse seems to work ok looks nice easy install etc biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature every time go to use the pc it asleep then have to either click button which may may not cause an action on the pc or pick it up and down several times too annoying so stopped using it might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling definitely not for daily use 
positive,the headset is really comfortable great quality and really really good overall
positive,good lighting on the keys for typing in low lighting comfortable typing perfect keyboard size not huge but not tiny either wish there was way to but batteries in it in case the internal rechargeable battery ever goes out it does come with cable for charging overall very good keyboard happy with it so far 
positive,i didn buy it for gaming but love it 
neutral,lovin it 
positive,good looking keyboard my son love the color and its dual you can used with cord or without cord 
positive,like that this product is waterproof camouflage that about it the jbl charge is better product thought the would be an upgrade but in my experience in less than year the speaker now won hold charge my charge had had excellent sound long battery life only crocked because the charge port became loose after years of hefty use very displeased by the fact have to constantly charge the the sound quality doesn seem better either ve only used the charger the came with too with the was able to use the universal android which was handy 
positive,i love this only it won hook up to my phone calls via bluetooth sound quality is amazing love the battery life 
positive,you get what you pay for what did expect just save and buy an actual headset like from corsair or some turtle beaches are better than these 
neutral,the headphones are pretty and worked well in the beginning but now there echo don know why and what happened but the suck now 
positive,very impressed overall

neutral,for the price can complain good beginner headset for gamer

positive,i like the build quality and how the headphones sound the mic quality is also good 
neutral,will not hook up to my laptop
neutral,i like this because it loud enough for me to listen to the music
positive,this mouse made my life easier honestly 
positive,these work well and the sound quality is good they completely cover the ears and seem to be comfortable enough they rest on the pad on top of the head and would probably get tired of that with extended wear but overall they are good product at good price

negative,worked flawlessly for few days then the left button became unreliable not worth the hassle to return update seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered refund if took down this review replied rather have corrected unit which would then review they replied they weren fixed yet and offered to my refund ignored it

neutral,the one ordered will only turn on if the switch is in strange position that is between the clicks had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until found the very small area where it turns on sending it back because its almost impossible to use if the switch gets moved it takes few minutes to turn it back on 
positive,the headphones were great purchase overall good price for great quality the design and comfort of them are excellent would recommend them to other gamers looking for headsets

positive,this keyboard is great it works exactly as advertised the keys are quiet the design is very fluid and the lights are cool charged it once when it came out of the box and have used it for hours doing work and playing games still haven had to recharge great product definitely worth the money 
neutral,no usb only type c
neutral,product is useless without charge 
positive,i really wanted to love this headset it looks nice and is very lightweight but no matter what did they sound quality was incredibly poor wanted to be able to chat with friends online while gaming and even with my output volume all the way up and friends turning me all the way up in their settings they could barely hear me could barely hear them or any of the sound coming from my pc ended up replacing them within week of purchase

neutral,i love this mouse its quiet modern and the lights are nice added touch pro tip remember to store the usb connector under the mouse when not in use have lost mine or damaged it in the past 
positive, so far so good does what it supposed to do worked right out of the box like that don have to buy batteries for it it charges quickly lasts looking time and is compatible with my hp chromebook it has two settings solid red color only when mouse is moving and slow changing rainbow when mouse is moving and or at rest the usb tucks away into the bottom of the mouse which is where you ll find it when you open the box for the first time also comes with an adapter and short charging cable 
positive,wanted this for living room computer put the wifi reciever into usb port in back of the pc by my tv and if use the charging cable that came with it got further away than using the wifi component it seems which means you get between ft of range for anything other than using it across room it does seem responsive easy to use and other wise great keyboard but if you want to sit more than ft from your computer you may want something else 
positive,i love all the colors this mouse has keep on thru the nite last long time on one charge
neutral,the mouse is comfortable to use notice while using it there is bit of lag would recommend if the slim design is what you are looking for would not recommend for gaming use it for work 
neutral,first rate frompackaging to product son just wanted something different thanks again
positive,batteries would be so much easier with the way the power runs out after charging by usb frustrating because if your in the middle of something have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use love the feel of it though and the cool lights 
positive,these headsets have great sound which was surprised the transmit volume is little low but you can still be heard and for me it doesn fit well but my daughter said they do her after hearing the sound from these am probably going to order me new pair cause mine apparently are horrible but won these cause they just don fit me well for kid would recommend them in heartbeat

neutral,this sister last uses
positive,this is very nice mouse for the price the charge in the battery lasts long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever perfect for use during lecture at school when you don want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises not sure how this would be for gamers but the switchable dpi is very nice feature as well also do feel that should point out that the rgb lights are switchable on and off which is nice feature if you are like me and are in class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips

neutral,yes
neutral,i used this once and when it died charged it for few days and it still won work

neutral,is not usb it works well but plastic feels cheap and flymsy 
neutral,purchased for imac compter seamless setup and operation 
positive,it worked fine for the first two weeks now it just stops playing music randomly doesn puase the music because the music on the phone is still going but you can hear anything have to press play on the speaker hasn been dropped or even exposed to any water even though its water proof

neutral,easy to carry 
positive,works great for work super comfy even with my glasses 
negative,the overall audio is really good but you can only hear from one side of the headphone and every often you can hear static noise that is coming from the headset and the only way you can fix it is by unplugging and plugging back in and know that not exactly you know annoying or an inconvenience but it is kind of annoying to you know having to unplug and plug back in

neutral,the first seconds it works fine then is glitchy and is worthless 
positive,i like this wireless mouse for now hoping nothing goes wrong with it so far it been very dependable and works correctly the design is perfect and love the different colors it works the moment you connect the usb connector to the computer and turn the mouse on the only thing don like is how quickly it goes into sleep mode but that not too big of an annoyance 
neutral,mic doesn work and have to mess with the head jack to get both speakers to work
positive,mouse is great bargain does everything it should do
negative,the aux input doesn work properly the sound keeps cutting out this is simply bad design and when contacted jbl support about this here was their official response our jbl charge normally goes on standby when there is no sound coming out of the speaker for while this feature can be turned off they called their poor design feature much in the same way faulty brakes on car is feature they also solicited me for star review and incentivized me with gift card so stars 
neutral,compact slim and well light recharges quickly when drained completely comes out of sleep mode in the blink of an eye 
neutral,very good sound
negative,was decent first month very flat so not ergonomic but that personal taste issue is this is already broken the scroll wheel no longer works even for mouse that pretty pathetic since ve had other mouses for years at time had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor 
positive,the mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun it auto shuts off after minutes think which is great for saving the battery thought that having to put it on charger would be major inconvenience it not at all the recharge is quick and only do it once week so far

positive,its so cute slim and pretty 
neutral,after only months it will no longer hold charge

neutral,quit working after weeks of use
positive,perfect my son loves them

positive,have not had this too long and ve charged it and it won turn on anymore made sure switch is off even changed chargers it stopped working 
positive,it is good speaker the sound quality is great no complains about it it feels really good built and the bass is great but the volume it is not as good as thought would be not bad at all because of the speaker size the batery time claims to be hours of playtime but havent try for that long yet but in general terms it is good speaker
positive,very happy with the sound quality 
positive,great product very competitive price 
positive,the texture is very good to hold and mostly very quiet feel very good about this shopping experience the shipment was very fast and it arrived much earlier than expected 
positive,the photo compares the flip smaller and charge larger the charge is well worth the extra it louder more bass and much much crisper sound the flip sounds just like the wonderboom which is fine but not for really enjoying the range of sound of your music haven purchased any other bluetooth speakers so can speak on how these compare to bose or other more expensive brands for my needs in bedroom apartment of these in the bedroom kitchen and bathroom works nicely very easy to connect battery life is amazing does take time to charge but plays and charges at the same time they connected to one another easily 
negative,the matte coating started peeling off within week or two of using it it still works well but looks terrible 
neutral,i ordered this in early june and really enjoyed the fun color and sleek design however now in late july about months later first the usb transmitter broke off and got stuck in my laptop and then the mouse itself stopped charging and no longer works guess you get what you pay for look elsewhere 
positive, aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow like how it wireless and it can even work from small distance away on another table from separate from my computer it works very well it has an on and off button for storage 
negative,shown new work with ps works barely but requires cord to be plugged into usb port for lights sound was terrible box condition showed headset had at best been repackaged at worst repaired sold as new don wast your time or money on these

positive,i am fan on jelly bean type of mouse had previous jelly bean mouse that ended up giving to family member and was searching for another one to replace it and came across this one the lights is the one that did the trick for me here just love the lights other than that its nice light mouse could have been little shorter its longer mouse compared to my previous one but other than that very functional and light and can be carried in the pockets to meetings in offices which is what do primarily with this one 
positive,works well hooked up immediately love the feels and the look 
neutral,mouse is nice and lightweight and quiet but its lags and jumps around sometimes

positive,works great my year old enjoys playing with this using his xbox

positive,we used for gaming works great and really good price for the quality 
neutral,i bought this brand for the conveniance of using adapter provided with the product for usb the adapter is so loose it falls off tried in different computers that has usb csame problem have days to return let me check how long the battery holds good before charge 
neutral,beautifully produced and lovely to look at for mouse the lights are welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace did notice that it tends to go into sleep mode quickly but takes longer wake up time than expect on screen busy with windows the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life it frustrating for anyone who isn patient 
positive,it looked like it does in the pic listing says it works with apple no clear directions on using it with the iphone terrible self support and regular support the info of setting up iphone was basically it works on some stuff might work on iphone figure it out yourself the support is none they never contacted me back and couldn get it to work so sent it back worst service ve had on amazon no excuse for not at least responding to support issue steer clear of them they don care about their customers 
positive,great for pc
positive,these are so amazing gaming headphones love them cant hear any noise this product is great

positive,i recently got job working from home and needed mouse to accompany purchased the rose gold it is beautiful came on time and hooked up with no issues if you want to use the color changing lights make sure to flip the switch on the bottom of the mouse all the way to the sunshine symbol took me few to figure that out but otherwise great product 
positive,jbl did it again another excellent speaker just like all the rest nice
positive,the mouse is aesthetically very cute and does feel nice on the hand main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities the mouse will randomly jump across the screen which has never happened with any other mouse it led to misclicks ve deleted emails didn mean to because of it essentially just unreliable

neutral,for gaming 
positive,easy to set up connect happy with this product
positive,bought this headset for gaming it comfortable on the ears good because when play tend to play for looong time and has high quality sound and microphone the only con is that it is mostly plastic

neutral,i don know if there is compatibility issue but it just doesn work most of the time try to click on things and there is no response don recommend it at all 
positive,great headphones and they hold up well for how rough my kids are with them 
negative,i was told that the speaker makes two sounds before playing audio from the other paired device one for when it turns on via pressing the power button and another for once it connects to paired device got no sounds from either of actions turn the fully charged speaker on from this point am supposed to hear sound notifying that the device is on all see is the power button light light up then press the bluetooth button and that lights up too then connect it to my phone which has connected to other bluetooth devices perfectly fine get the notification on my phone that it is connected to the speaker but no sounds from the speaker notifying that it is connected to the phone even reset the speaker and it still gives no sound very disappointed will be returning

positive,excellent sound
positive,these are great headphones my year old son loves them the noise canceling is very impressive on them for the price 
positive,excellent keyboard have ever use it keyboard lights just light up whenever you touch any keyboard key but it would be nice if package would comes as combo with mouse 
neutral,i got white one and the leds shine thru the plastic the pointer tracking laser noticeably strobes will get something better made
neutral,my fav speaker ever 
neutral,most think this will work on gaming console partially they will but how the console is designed there is no usb port next to an audio outlet there fore the player is left to choose between the lights on the earphones working or the audio working and we all know audio is must so all that is left is whats the point of the lights if you cant use em while gamethese are computer gaming earphones
positive,for the price it is great 
positive,love it while it worked great quality suddenly stopped holding charge nothing happened to it obviously could be coincidence that it happened right after warranty expiration but suspicious enough that think will buy different brand in the future after good experience this one had bought another maybe months ago and we ll have to see if that lasts more than year now too
negative,dead in weeks
neutral,they are ok for the money
positive,to charge have to press down on the cord where it plugs into the mouse and hope for the best scroll wheel clicks are loud

positive,i bought two of these speakers and was quite satisfied at first my first would not hold the charge after quite bit of use bought second one and the battery would not hold charge contacted the company and was never contacted the speaker is good battery and customer service is quite questionable 
positive,likes no noise click lights look cool chargeabledislikes chargeable battery life is very short had to turn off every time don use it or else battery runs out super fast within days after months the charging outlet is broken there no way to fix it now can use it anymore safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for long time

positive,i had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had lot of reviews it works great the mouse looks good and has sleek design the led lights are fun touch and the dpi feature is nice to have had zero issues connecting the mouse to my macbook wirelessly to with the usb port what did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use coming from mouse that had an arch in the design this mouse was little flatter than that another are the clicks and scrolls it definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling it not loud like compared to regular mice but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse did end up returning the mouse but would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design it still great mouse overall

neutral,nice sleek design however does not hold the charge for long it frustrating when the computer is turned on and it doesn come on after switching it on 
neutral,convenient and quiet mouse

positive,i have had this headset for month and half it very good headset love it so much big fan with how many different color choices for the headset there are too thank you guys so much 
positive,its great good sound quality and style 
positive,i love this keyboard the keys are super quiet and it comfortable to type on it great having the colors as opposed to simple white backlight only have two issues first do with the colors were tad bit brighter second would like way say downloadable software to control the brightness as well as how fast the colors fade or not at all even and lastly how long before sleep mode kicks in for the price though you definitely can complain and frankly feel my issues are very minor 
positive,all around solid best dollar investment ve made 
neutral,does work for ps controller just doesn have plug to light up
positive,the mouse works better then expected the battery life has exceeded week so far if you have surface go this mouse will not disappoint very happy with this item would recommend

neutral,this is clean simple design completely simple to install 
negative,package was opened and parts were missing had charging cable bu no other parts paid fo new product
negative,love the slimline appearance and the changing colors the colors add sense of fun to normally mundane piece of computer equipment also love the ability to keep it one color red or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor good product well designed make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on off switch but has three positions this is now october this mouse broke after little use while traveling the scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless this appears to be poor design and weak point in this item and would now not recommend it have had other computer mice for years without this issue 
neutral,good quality sound
positive,i haven used them but they seemed great so far out of the box 
neutral,center wheel was hard to roll after couple of days few days later the whole thing failed like the rechargeable feature but battery does not last long
neutral,ok
positive,i pruchased this because since working from home have become so tired of all the wires from mouse not only is this great price but plugged it in charged it from the box and it started working perfectly it is smaller than my older mouse but like it it is silent and feels nice in my hand 
neutral,does not work at all lights come on but it doesn connect to dongle and does nothing 
neutral,came with speaker but no directions or charging cable 
positive,headphones are great with amazing sound quality decent noise cancellation and would say it good for gaming did realize when it at full volume you can hear it from distance and sadly the lights don rly work bc the wire that makes the light turn on doesn reach when also try to use the headphones 
positive,i like that this cute mouse holds charge for days and is rechargeable no more batteries dying on me 
positive,i thought it was battery operated but didn read the description well enough it lasts about days between charges at least can see the keyboard without the lights on happy with it 
positive,the quality was great and everything worked fine it was very easy to use but it only worked for about months until the mic stopped working it seems others had the same issue as well not too bad for price though edit the microphone started to work again it occasionally gets spotty and my audio can sound muffled to others but that not all the time the speakers still work great can hear clearly 
positive,the speaker was for my husband motorcycle he able to put it on his motorcycle ride with it bluetooth connection real easy for him the sound of the speakers very loud he very happy with it easy for him to set up and he was able to charge it without taking it off his motorcycle so that even better plus it waterproof he loves it and we will definitely buy it again two thumbs up
neutral,this is probably the single most frustrating headset have ever dealt with the mm jack fits loosely in dell workstation it is not wired correctly does not work in combo headset mic jack on the same workstation the usb connection is purely to power the leds ended up replacing with cheaper headset from reputable manufacturer and all of the issues ceased 
positive,i have this same model in bluetooth and it works great needed it for an old yoga win laptop no issues and works great
positive,good sound easy to use
positive,best mouse have ever used very smooth and really sharp looking 
positive,its really light weight and you don hear the mouse clicks however the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse didn have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn have visible battery so used the tip of knife to pop the usb out almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out you may do better job than me 
neutral,no quality
positive,the company is so kind and understanding really appreciated all their help with the product 
positive,i love the way this mouse performs 
positive,awesome quality and great price
neutral,it is good for noise canceling
neutral,the keyboard is very light and doesn feel too cheap but it never detected on my dell computer not sure if it my software windows or the keyboard but it would light up and then go dark when tried typing on it the manual didn explain anything because the keyboard is supposed to automatically be detected and work my other vic mouse and redragon keyboard work just fine returning for refund will stick with my wired for now 
neutral,never buy this product when buy something usually look at product reviews but this product seems to have lot of problems unlike reviews don usually post reviews but posting this product review in hopes that there won be victims like me bought mouse and it worked fine at first but after charging it it started to get weird and didn work at all so thought there might be small problem so exchanged the new one instead of refund received new mouse and it worked fine for another few days but after charging it again it didn work the product user manual says it is sensitive to charging but this is serious problem bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire but think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem 
positive,i don do gaming really just wanted lighted keyboard could use with my home theater setup this one does the job but after six months the on off switch developed problem so contacted the company about the issue they responded really fast and bent over backward to supply me with satisfactory solution super nice folks too recommended 
positive,great product for gaming at great price
neutral,be ready to turn it on and off every mins of non use the thing goes into sleep mode then is sluggish in its response time till you restart it not something would reccomend
positive,it wasn until my husband gave me his mouse to play my sims with that realized how much loved using one even on laptop he said could have his red and black one but lo and behold when opened up amazon and put in wireless mouse found my own type of dream mouse got the mint green colored one and honestly obsessed with the glowing of the different colors great mouse great price wish needed more than one to be honest 
positive,this mouse is the best it got quiet click and has sleep mode as well highly recommend 
neutral,didn last worked for short while guess you get what you pay for 
positive,my gf loves her headset
positive,great sound for the value sounds like your at live concert
positive,for the price it works fine and is comfortable can wear it for hours and it doesn hurt have no idea about noise cancelling not an audiophile or anything but it sounds fine to me for my needs have asked people on the other end if the mic sounds good and they say they can hear me fine it is loud enough but do wish it was able to get even louder for some uses rating it stars for filling my needs but stars on the gaming scale because while can hear footsteps and surround sound sure it must not be as good as turtle beach or something ve also had it for years and no issues no idea about the lights because ve never plugged that in 
positive,this mouse works very well holds good charge and is easy to connect and transport as travel quite bit 
neutral,the scroll wheel broke
positive,i absolutely love this keyboard normally get just the regular wireless or plug in but never again can type so much faster on this keyboard it responds beautifully fewer typos even because it keeps up with me and the cool lighting is pleasing bonus 
positive,i would give it stars if could my husband loves it very loud and great for outside at the lake we lost it in the lake for weeks and found it at the neighbors by their dock best part is it still works no sound quality loss or anything would highly recommend 
positive,it works smoothly and the colors are fun keeps charged for good while

neutral,so have had this mouse for about weeks and it works perfectly never encountered the problems people had with it stopping and people say that the battery dies too quickly which have been using on the same battery without charging it for days my cursor has also never messed up it works just fine the only problem have with this device is the lighting is not nearly as impressive as thought it would be but guess that what you get for buying mouse for 
neutral,mouse is pretty solid all around except about day after started using it the wheel started squeaking figure it might go away in time nope months later still squeaking and getting more irritating by the day working in an quiet office it is loud enough that other people can hear it 
neutral,excelente bocina
positive,used it to video chat during online games works great
positive,these headphones are great for gaming with my friends like that the microphone folds up and it works perfectly with my ps would say that the passive noise cancellation is just due to the thick memory foam earmuffs which are nice but wanted to make it clear that they aren active noise cancellation headphones

neutral,they moved the back slash and pipe command key down next to the key and made the enter key taller keep hitting the key instead of the enter key 
positive,good headset for ps recently got mine and they are overall good for everything

negative,i ve had of these randomly stop working in the last year both stopped clicking after minimal use less than days on the first one less than for the second don understand why this product is so highly rated it terrible learn from my mistakes 
positive,jbl charge produces the most awesome high quality sound from portable bluetooth speaker have ever heard from including larger speakers you could jam to music or watch movie with movie theater quality sound worth every penny 
neutral,stopped working less than month after purchase 
neutral,classic jbl speaker can go wrong also beautiful color
positive,its very light and fast comfortable and changes different colors great buy 
positive,works great for our daughter 
negative,this mouse was bad quality 
positive,great 
positive,they do feel cheap and that ok for the price but the mic and sound are better than expected so you won be disappointed of you consider the price the mic is loud and clear and it does an amazing job at filtering my music playing on the background so it just picks up my voice and does not disturb other players 
negative,why there no lights or showing if it charged or not have to turn it on to see the lights to see if it charge do you have to do that all the time turn it on to see if it charged or can you just plug it in and the lights will show if it when it going to be fully chargeyou have to turn it on to see the lights to see if it charge do you have to do that all the time turn it on to see if it charged or can you just plug it in and the lights will show maybe something wrong with mine please let me know
neutral,the mouse is cute and like the colours but it dies every hour and have to plug it back in and just revert back to the mouse pad will be returning and getting something more basic with longer range of not having to be charged up 
positive,only thing don like about it is that the cable included in the package is only for charging rather than for charging and wired use you must use the wireless adapter for it to work not huge deal but it would be nice if wired use was an option it would make sense 
positive,i love my new jbl speakers the sound is very clear and you can connect more than one at time that is great improvement over the older speakers wish could trade my older ones in for these new ones 
positive,it works well looks pretty and very smooth to use good buy
positive,mouse arrived the next day easy to set up and use have had no problems at all it works as it should 
negative,this mouse absolutely sucks ve tried charging it and the blue light appears then after minutes it goes out plugged it in at and hours later it still dead and they sent it to me again and it keeps happening it doesn charge and it doesn work it just cheap plastic don get it 
negative,loved this cute little mouse but it broke after months the wheel broke off from the gear 
positive,the headphones arrived very quickly as someone who has been using them for quite few months now they are very durable have unfortunately dropped them on the mic good few times but to all surprise they have held up sound quality is good and so is the mic they do get smudged quite easily though but you get what you pay for overall solid from me 
positive,i love it the colors make me happy it so comfortable to use 
neutral,i bought this about months ago and it worked perfect in the course of normal use turned it off and then went to plug it in immediately after noticed the unit wouldnt charge and proceeded to try several other chargers to no avail since product is slightly more than year old jbl is offering to give me the names of local repair shops that can pay out of pocket to fix this shoddy workmanship for premium product that is more than likely designed to break after warranty so you ll have to buy another just dont get how it can work and after turning if off while working it would proceed to never turn on again if you want to throw away every year then this is the perfect speaker for you was offered discount on future speaker but that is not the answer wanted or expected 
positive,i spend hrs on the computer day for work and gaming this is the best keyboard on the market not only that my windows key stopped working tried troubleshooting but thought it was broke opened up support case with klim support and within the hour they replied with thorough set of troubleshooting ideas turns on there is windows key lock that my year old little guy turned on amazing support ll only be buying klim products moving forward 
positive,good bass and sound quality easy remote comfortable and game for like hrs at time sometimes 
positive,this thing is awesome great sound good battery life 
positive,the mic could be longer but the sound quality is awesome
neutral,constantly times out or goes to sleep and every time try to move it to use it again it takes me having to sit there and shake it for ten seconds at first not big deal but do that for few weeks and it incredibly frustrating went back to my old mouse ll know next time to pay for better mouse 
negative,this lags so bad not great
positive,love jbl products this is great speaker good size nice to look at very stable nice sound output
positive,excellent mouse for the price
positive,working great no problem
neutral,mouse worked fine for two weeks shape took some getting used to since it low profile charge held up pretty well but the scroll wheel broke after few weeks of use so in the trash it goes 
neutral,it just gets stains easily
positive,great for gaming
neutral,good sound quality for price ear cup little small 
positive,after my charge quit charging was thinking of switching to ue boom but couldn jbl knows what they re doing and couldn go without the bass very good speaker for its price 
positive,great speaker sounds amazing gave it star only because it needs little more bass and it doesn make calls it would be nice if can call and talk through speaker then would have gave it stars 
negative,the keyboard is definitely quiet but the enter key is in an awkward position if you learned how to type and don hunt and peck you will constantly be hitting the slash key rather than the enter key this gets very frustrating when trying to type reports and documents it has nice look and my kids thought it was cool with the colors but sadly it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs
positive,very comfortable great sound quality
neutral,this product came fast and has worked well
positive,i bought these for my son to use when playing the game and he loves them they do cancel out the noise so sometimes he has one ear on and one ear off yeller so he can usually hear me with them on the mic is clear when he is talking during the game 
neutral,the item would charge but then would not turn on or work at all in the computer
negative,the idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun however was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop or any other usb port for that matter perhaps this one was defective but this was unacceptable would give zero stars if could 
neutral,thks
negative,i bought this first time and after few months it died completely even after being charged it will not respond when turned back on thought it might just be one time defect and bought another this time it died completely after month nice while it worked but will not be buying rd time 
positive,this is my second jbl speaker and the first one lasted me almost years with no issues so far this one works pretty well and has good sound quality every once and while the bt won automatically connect and have to manually do it the battery life is good usually listen to music as get ready for work in the mornings and it lasts three weeks doing that before it needs recharge 
positive,these headphones are comfortable and the noise cancelling is great the sound quality is also very good both through the headphones and through the mic the only issue is the wires it impossible to use the lights through the usb and plug in the headphone jack at the same time on my laptop because the usb and headphones inserts are on opposite sides and the wire isn long enough which is really irritating when the actual wire is very long and its just the split wires part that too short the extender they give with the product also seems cheap the sound through the headphones with the extender is completely messed up to the point of it being unusable none of these problems are with the headphones itself so still gave stars but it annoying that can use every feature included honestly the product is solid stars 
neutral,feels very light weight and doesn sit tight if you touch type you will most likely find this unsuitable for daily fast moving entry 
negative,can just say wow this mouse is absolutely incredible the wireless feature and led lights make this thing steal for its price it is super helpful when want to stay in bed but still use my pc from afar can just pull this bad boy out and start going it has silent clicks to it as well so you wont be waking or bothering anybody buy using this mouse and with its low profile shape and structure it takes up practically no room whatsoever 
negative,very very bad stay away 
neutral,the scroller doesn work mouse feels generic
neutral,product did not move smoothly across the mouse pad and did not fit my hand particularly well 
neutral,i almost didn submit this review because they re forcing me to type something 
neutral,mic broke after few months and know its these headphones because every other headset ive used worked
negative,ive tried everything under the sun to make it work and alas it will not lol don buy it not worth it
positive, so far so good does what it supposed to do worked right out of the box like that don have to buy batteries for it it charges quickly lasts looking time and is compatible with my hp chromebook it has two settings solid red color only when mouse is moving and slow changing rainbow when mouse is moving and or at rest the usb tucks away into the bottom of the mouse which is where you ll find it when you open the box for the first time also comes with an adapter and short charging cable 
positive,pros significantly cheaper backlit keys rechargeable looks good sturdycons off brand name keys feel little plasticy battery life is little light not bad just don expect it to last for weeks without charging that it ve had two now after many logitech backlit wireless keyboards and for half the price or less can safely safe that logitech the big name is absolute garbage in comparison 
positive,i got these for my husband to use on zoom while he works from home he loves that he can hear our kids in the background and that he hears the people he talking with very clearly he says he is made fun of daily though for the size of these headphones his clients and colleagues constantly ask him if he become gamer they also crack jokes about him being an air traffic controller ve offered to find him new headphones but he has declined he takes the poking fun in stride and sees it as an icebreaker for his work sessions with his clients and colleagues overall great purchase wish had gotten them for him year ago when he first started working from home 
neutral,the wheel for scrolling breaks to easily this is the second one that ve purchased with the same issue will try another brand 
neutral,it ok wished the lighting stayed on going into sleep mode 
neutral,overall was satisfied with this product 
positive,it was great value it arrived quickly it works great the usb doesn fit my port but the mouse only need usb 
positive,the mouse doesn work the reason they have good ratings is because they ask you to rate star and promise refund don buy 
neutral,they aren bad for the price but my earbuds on my phone are louder than this don use them as often because of this 
neutral,the audio coming in is muffled and the headphones feel all around cheap made of not flexible plastic however if you have no choice they are functional 
positive,this is great value am using with my laptop as dont like the keyboard on my laptop love this 
neutral,while the overall sound is decent for the price bought two speakers specifically for the party feature which is supposed to allow two or more of the same speakers to connect and play together ve had nothing but problems with that feature ve tried resetting per company instructions even sent them back and got two new speakers but the same problems exist if you want one speaker go right ahead but would advise against getting more than one 
positive,this is user friendly works well and holds charge for long time would buy it again
neutral,i like it
positive,i like this mouse the light colors constantly scroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great nightlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the cursor will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic glitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer 
negative,this is an awesome keyboard but what triggered my purchase was that thought it was water proof not sure how got that idea think some reviews had read were making mistake of saying water proof and not water resistant had also read reviews on another site that mentioned silicon sealed internals and the keyboard has quite few holes in it they are very well engineered for liquid to run onto and through the keyboard drying it very quickly have inquisitive pet birds that knock stuff over all the time onto my keyboards and are also fascinatd with stomping around on the keys seems to be weird fascination with most larger birds have seen so the idea of keyboard could just wash in the sink was awesome except that it isn have ran into few other people that have made the same assumption and instant destruction of an awesome keyboard as myself woulodn even really call it water resistant the board the battery wires and well everything is jsimply placed inside with no covering or anything while the drainage heoles do help mitigate spill damage the internal components seem very ill quiped for moisture of any typ my keyboard died quite instantly upon wiping it down with damp rag bit on the wet side though rung out quite bit so be careful this was selling point that somehow got very confusing which failed upon light testing of the water resistance 
neutral,after months of use keys p n have died did not spill any water onto it and was used somewhat frequently for programming guess that is expected due to the cheap price point but was hoping it lasted at least bit longer 
positive,perfect budget mouse if your working with macbook like am very smooth and responsive but wouldn recommend for gaming because any crazy fast movement can kind of lag but for my online studies it been perfect very very long battery life don think ve charged it since bought it 
positive,like it size perfect fit for laptop bag
positive,i love it portability it loud in proximity but not too obnoxiously loud to disturb neighbors when use it in my open garage it connects quickly and it easy to pair battery life lasts much longer than jbl flip lastly purchasing strap accessory is good investment so you can carry it around 
positive,worked great very pretty aquamarine color easy you use precise and then suddenly died today stop charging so after few months it departed this world without sound not worth it wish it did going to order from another maker 
negative,this was absolutely the worst headset ever received had bought the adapter and plugged it into my xbox controller the sound was so far away even on high volume the quality was bad it looks nicer in the picture than it actually is would not recommend this item at all
positive,i bought one to try for myself at home and loved it so much ordered two more to use at work this is the best wireless mouse ve ever had great value too 
neutral,i don use this every day it less than two years old and already time for replacement the wire casing at the connection point is cracked and internal wires are exposed works great but should have lasted longer 
positive,like it very much great price great performance and cute too 
positive,just love color
positive,good quality and excellent battery life 
positive,totally worth it very good product it was gift for my brother and he loved it the sound quality is great 
neutral,i get annoyed with the small things that they cheap out on in speakers and really if had to find something wrong with it it would be the that the outer edges are plastic and not rubber but they make cases for them so not too big of deal
positive,if you are looking for great quality gaming headset this is what you are looking for the sound range of the headset is great the noise cancellation is fantastic can see my fianc talking to me and just nodding cuz honestly can hear anything of what he is saying am very pleased 
positive,pretty cool mouse honestly was only looking for simple mouse to use with my laptop the tracking works great and the colors are pretty cool nothing like adding little color to your workstation being able to recharge the mouse is plus 
neutral,works beautifully has same problem all head phones have how long before the cable snaps and the jack falls off took some tooth picks and electrical tape to make sort off splint around the jack confident it will hold if you have the same problem with head phones try that method stars 
positive,this little box has great sound love it
positive,my husband had the prior version and we loved it so much so that purchased this with the case to link to his we use them everywhere and lot charge life is excellent even better than my husband individual and linked stereo sound fantastic portability at the beach by the pool and around the property when we re doing projects and chores great and convenient ease of use for technical illiterate such as myself ranks so after an entire summer of almost daily use giving this solid 
positive,good mouse for regular use great rgb lighting
negative,bad audio broken mic flimsy big and you can hear the audio even with them on horrible headset would not recommend
neutral,ease of use
positive,it came really fast got it in one day it is really sleek and works really smooth chose my favorite color of course but love all the colors the light goes through also really like that it has button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light and of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries the other mouse have have to use batteries so that was major selling point for this one 
positive,i was hoping for much more sound than got mic is ok
positive,great speaker
positive,got these for my year old son who wanted some gaming headphones he gave the reviews said they are great 
negative,horbile never worked be careful they fool u
positive,came charged has an off on and then the color switch quiet quick my favorite mode is that when it idle for while it shuts down and you just click and it comes back to life exactly what wanted easy usb charge hope it lasts me for while 
neutral,i ve owned jbl speakers since the and have always been totally satisfied 
neutral,the ball already broke 
positive,i bought this gift for my children for their computer games and they are delighted 
neutral,we bought this for my son to use and it lasted months before the scrolling wheel broke 
positive,i bought this for my year old son he loves it and uses it everyday haven had problem yet would recommend 
positive,good quality helps cancel noise love the volume control on the side of it 
negative,nothing special about this keyboard not fond of the manufacturers website adding to this review after less than year of use the battery is failing one of the issues is the forced keyboard lighting there is no way to turn it off while the keyboard saw heavy use the main function wireless is hampered by poor design am reducing my review to reflect this issue after testing do not recommend this product 
neutral,doesn work after less than days of having it
positive,hi and use this for gaming and distance learning it great can really get into my games when gaming because the sound quality is great and really enjoy feeling like in the game it isn quite noise canceling because can still hear bit when have the headphones on my head overall happy with my purchase

positive,works great
positive,feels great sleek different colors for different laptops nice 
positive,great mouse speak design no clicking noises really pretty and easy to use 
positive,i purchased this wireless mouse to use with laptop purchased it on amazon due to the slimness color and uniqueness am exceptionally happy with the mouse and would recommend 
neutral,appearance is bit different than was expecting also doesn glide smoothly and quickly enough on the screen not sure why sending back after day of use swiched to my old bluetooth mouse within hours
neutral,have tried multiple charging cords and power sources including the one they provide and the keyboard just won charge when first bought it charged it up no problem this is the first time the battery died and when trying to recharge it nothing happens 
negative,all reviews that said this keyboard is quiet or silent are liars
neutral,the scroll wheel stopped working days after bought it used it less than times
neutral,no carrying straps
neutral,the jbl is good speaker but when you have the audio go up more than the bass levels start to fade out that is common problem for jbls but it still works good
neutral,this mouse worked great for months then the scroll wheel broke don waste your money 
neutral,product was great just the delivery was horrible this is the first time ve ever had issues they crammed it so tight in my mailbox like to have never gotten it out and could ve damaged my product just by trying to get it outta the mailbox 
positive,the best
positive,this mouse works very well holds good charge and is easy to connect and transport as travel quite bit 
positive,works great charges fast with cool lighting
positive,works great love them only concern is it can not plug into my xbox controller it has to be plugged into the console but for pc gaming they are great 
negative,this keyboard looks really good but the description is deceiving as they claim it to be silent or quiet this keyboard is so not close to being quiet one it has really loud keys which wasnt fan of 
neutral,i have only purchase it for about weeks and this headset sucks plug it into my ps controller and for some reason it keeps messing with the controller it keeps automatically scrolling up and down like you are holding down the stick the sound and mic are fine so far but not woth it when you have trouble selecting an option in game have to unplug the headset to be able to select then plug it back in 
neutral,the mouse does not work on mouse pad can only seem to get it to work on piece of paper and even then it glitchy 
positive,works great and my students love the color changing lights bought it for my second computer and it has been so helpful would suggest purchasing for yourself it has very smooth texture and slim design always you to take it anywhere it charged quickly so that could use it immediately 
neutral,too flat hard to use
positive,great works good
neutral,had to exchange first one after month replacement was fast and easy
neutral,i bought of these headphones for my kids one came in none working condition and got replaced however after using more than month both stopped working and return window is over please avoid buying 
positive,i really like the design and feel of this mouse bought in week the lights are cool and like the sleep feature if it not used for minutes great price 
negative, the ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing it is lightweight and feels cheap white matches my setup but it translucent and takes way from the aesthetic it is connected less than ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag it makes it completely useless to me don recommend you buy it at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging 
neutral,the mouse worked well for couple days but then intermittently started cutting out and after week it wouldn stay turned on for more than seconds despite it being fully charged it very cute but unfortunately will be going back 
neutral,it good
positive,good mouse for the price and the buttons do not make noise so it feels nice when clicking which is win for me
positive,ordered this mouse in early september as of today it no longer holds charge bought this mouse to have something portable to go along with my laptop as generally dislike using the trackpad it size was ideal and it was overall comfortable and easy to use however this mouse does not hold charge at all had to charge it at least twice per week remember this is not mouse used on my primary computer either and yes do turn it off when it is stored in my bag not thrilled that now have to replace it after only year of use and will not be purchasing again 
positive,i bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of pain to use the mouse is slightly small in my hand but is still comfortable and tracks well really appreciate that it charges from micro usb cable great value for the price 
negative,i purchased gold they sent black tried to send it back but amazon couldn afford gas so the place needed to return it to was inconvenient so kept it big mistake got it at end of april and the scroll portion is already broken sham of mouse and company 
positive,great sound have one on my patio and one with my camping gear
positive,while it isn on par with some of the more expensive headsets out there for the value that it was give discounted this is good pair of headsets that helps for those that want to get into the video gaming craze this pair of headphones is big so size should be covered for those with big round heads while the game audio is bit filled with bass at times the quality outside of that is really good and the size comes to an advantage again as it helps with noise cancellation both in mic and in speakers if you can get the same deal did recommend it for first timer 
positive,i got this because have laptop and sometimes that little square isn enough it easy to set up easy to use have no problems as of yet
positive,sone loves it
positive,my grand son love the head phoneand love the color
positive,amazing for the price 
neutral,can listen to music all night long and into the next day without recharging 
positive,besides driver totally dropping my package on my door step and watched him act like he didn tthis speaker is great the only thing wish it had like the jbl flip is its own sperate volume instead relying off just solely the phones volume this is great for hr shift
neutral,where to start purchased this to use at an upcoming bbq pool party we were having with approximately guest when it first arrived fully charged it no wall charger included connected to bluetooth it was working fine for the short time used it the day of our party it would play for short time and stop but was showing it was connected to bluetooth it was very frustrating having to stop what we were doing to try to figure out the cause never figured it out the sound quality was subpar lacked in bass and at times distorted the overall sound was mono not what you would expect for the price and an upgraded model also you will not receive any of your phone notifications when using the speaker so you need to keep your phone with you we ended up having to use an old bose speaker so our guest would have continuous music without the constant interruption would not recommend the charge couple of our friends own the charge and it sounds and preforms much better than the returned
positive,cute little plug and play usb keyboard 
positive,i ordered the red color but got the grey one it was gift but the recipient didn mind the color sound is excellent portability and build quality are excellent and connection is smooth and seamless used as sound bar for computer and on the go 
neutral,the price for such big speaker which isn too loud
positive,i purchased this mouse as the wheel on my old one quit working loved the design and wanted another so ordered it and received it aug it is oct and the wheel just quick working again would recommend looking at different mouse if you prefer your scrolling feature 
positive,stoped working after few weeks it won charge 
negative,sound quality is horrific find speaker like the jbl extreme or that has stereo sound instead god awful even when plugged in with an aux connection instead of bluetooth stay away form this product and heed the warning of the other reviews about this speaker only having mono sound
neutral,it is overall descent headset it can get annoying that the mic isn curved or more movable than just up and down give it 
neutral,this headset is so big and bulky especially for kid the audio is fine and is better than most budget headsets the mic started having static issues after months every time you slightly move the cable the static is incredibly loud through the mic to the people you re playing with that tells me the internal components are poor quality or poorly put together 
neutral,i really was disappointed in this product just needed an extra mouse for work andnit only worked for few hours before the problems started it wouldn track where the mouse was and the lights worked but the mouse was useless other than the light show save your time and choose mouse from more reputable company
positive,absolutely in love exceeded expectations highly reccomend 
positive,this is our second purchase my son likes it alot the first one the mic went out due to he kept putting it in his mouth great headset for the money 
positive,i recommend everyone for this speaker lucky to have it 
neutral,works fine with xbox
positive,we liked this headphones the fact that they light up look amazing the only problem is that the cable that lights it up is very short so you have to be close to the console in order to connect the light it very uncomfortable cuz if you move it unpluggs other than that my son likes it very much 
positive,i never looked into jbl before this sound quality is amazing durability is top notch it is sleek and not to bulky have not tested out the waterproof part but think leave that for another time the battery lasts very long time like it says hrs it also great backup portable charger for my phone kinda wish got the bigger one just because really liked this brand this is me saying this not someone telling me to say it but if you like protecting your things would also get the carrying case will upload picture at another time 
neutral,the product is cheap and worked well for the first months but after that it started becoming unresponsive would plug it in because thought it was low in power but that didn solve the issue either use lap top and have lap desk where it has built in mouse pad area ve had it for years so was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn able to read it so bought new mouse pad but still nothing tried updating drivers with various programs tweaked bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites nothing so disconnected it and brought out my wired mouse and it isn working either this product even disabled my track pad but luckily found way to get it working blame this crap product as it literally almost bricked my laptop
neutral,awful
neutral,it doesn stay charged and it feels too light weight in your hand 
negative,did not work at all cheaply made and very disappointed
positive,honestly all the hate for this headset is uncalled for this headset has all you need at such good price fits perfectly and has long cord and the sound quality is amazing wouldn be where at gaming wise if it weren for these headsets allowing me to hear almost everything on the maps
positive,i love the color and the light the most it so easy to use and the best part is not having to download drivers 
positive,mouse is nice thought there was an option to not have it light up since don need that function but the options are off one color and alternating many colors it only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still glides good clicks well my only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be little unreliable if want to scroll down just line or two it won move and then if scroll just little faster it zooms down the page overall decent
positive,perfect but would like to see how much battery life have left
positive,love it
neutral,i followed the instructions to the letter and it was slow and laggy 
positive,i was very excited to get this speaker as ve always like jbl products however even though battery life was great was underwhelmed by the sound kind of muffled needless to say was very disappointed and returned it 
negative,i initially liked this mouse but after month it stopped working terrible product waste of money
positive,i used this guy for dayssssss upon receiving without charging few times ve had thought had issues with the mouse but had it backwards that my main complaint too easy to put backwards it doesn attract dust and dirt works on every surface ve put it on and it cute
neutral,it simple yet sleek looking mouse ve been using it for almost month and have no concerns about it recommend it 
positive,excellent all the way around so happy ordered another one it is great as well 
negative,i have this speaker for months and used it total of times it stays in case in my room always somehow it has stopped working it is not charging and switches off after couple seconds one light blinks consistently during charging but it isn charged will not recommend anyone spend this amount of money on speaker that will just stop working
positive,great product
positive,loved this at first however battery is pretty much shot am only using it with home entertainment system computer so it isn getting used lot however in less than months new need to charge it daily or at least every other day not sure the sleep function is working may try turning it off after every use to charge it less often but that will become annoying super fast even if it does work it will likely end up in the trash before long 
neutral,nice mouse for few months of light use after that it would not take charge even tried swapping cables big disappointment
neutral,it just dosen work
positive,this mouse was purchased for use with my laptop ve purchased two of the same brand previously but wanted something different so took chance on this unknown the mouse is light and ergonomic have fairly small hand and it fits well connection was simple the sleep mode will definitely increase battery life add to this the pretty lights and lovely rose color pleasantly surprised would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive and uncomplicated addition to their setup 
positive,so far so good this speaker gets loud without distortion love it and the color so much also like that it can charge my phone it convenient because my area is often plagued by wind storms and power outages sure ll be using it for that soon enough it was super easy to connect haven had any issues with the bluetooth connectivity the battery life is very good 
positive,i love the feel of this mouth love that it automatically goes to sleep and it has an on off button best portable mouse 
positive,i love the back lighting rechargeable battery and light personally only sit at desk when playing games mostly like wireless so don have to sit at flat surface for the keyboard use like to sit back from my computer on inch monitor tv for emails you tube videos and browsing the internet while holding the keyboard only when changing websites your design makes that harder to pick up or hold with the left hand and typing with the right the keys go to the very edge of the unit only the bottom and right top corner have spot to use thumb to hold without touching key little more area on right side would be ideal for many users comfort when holding the board especially near the esc key an another model perhaps flared out going to the top 
positive,i use these for playing wow and they are comfortable doing hour raid sound great and love the lighted feature works great so my wife doesnt hear all the chatter 
positive,i really like this mouse love that it doesn need batteries you just charge it and it ready to go did have issue with my macbook pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad and wasn able to scroll without using the mouse had to call apple to figure out how to fix it and that when discovered removing the usb adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem have usb to usb adapter from the mac store so just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly and it doesn change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all 
neutral,excelente
positive,sound quality is good overall would give it stars if it came with the carrying case as the charge did overall nice little speaker for taking to the lake or camping 
positive,lights are visible through white part because white part is thin but it nice
negative,garbage colors on keyboard go in and out and if you don touch keyboard for seconds it goes completely black waste of money cant see the keys when am gaming at night terrible one star for usability 
neutral,the max volume sounds more like the minimum volume this is my first purchase for gaming headset maybe this is normal but not fan 
positive,got it for my nephew he had smaller one but wanted to upgrade got really good deal during black friday sale nice system for home and now he using smaller one for his car 
positive,decent headphones my sons both have ordered pair and while they generally work pretty well they have had few hangups with them while playing games sometimes they have to be plugged and unplugged couple times before the sound works and sometimes it just doesn seem to want to work at all and yes the volume is up but overall they work about of the time and they were pretty cheap so 
neutral,it not what expected but it work
positive,it seems to be working just fine to me when it came also like the glowing effect from the led lights
neutral,i was really happy to use this mouse it light weight and really liked the color changing light however had it month and the wheel use to scroll up and down stopped working so basically it useless 
positive,i am still working with it to review the mouse connection and other parts and then other features to it so far so good
neutral,works great charge lasts long time no more batteries 
positive,nice gaming headset for cheap mic works great sound is great and the options to use for xbox ps or computer is pretty sweet my only gripe is the noise cancelling isn anywhere near bose beats or jbl and if you have pumpkin head like myself it houses big brain for gaming duh this headset can be little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time overall stars and buy again
positive,son loves the headset great price 
positive,works great
neutral,the mouse quality is poor type adapter doesn work can work for macbook but usb adapter works 
neutral,worked as soon as it was being used
neutral,product stopped working shortly after month wouldn click properly 
positive,this mouse was pretty great when first got it worked well went quite while without needing to charge quiet etc however months later it acting up almost constantly it skips around the screen and sometimes turns itself off like there an electrical short somewhere obviously too late to return but wanted to update my rating this wasn expensive but it shouldn act like it disposable 
positive,love it definitely worth the buy 
positive,the best
positive,love everything about it 
positive,the design and color is awesome also bought this product for my as well and would definitly recommend this product to family and friends there is nothing to dislike about this product
neutral,i bought my mouse few months ago and it was working just fine now the scroll wheel sunk into the mouse and stopped working

neutral,mouse was very light and would keep charge adapter broke week after got it

neutral,for gaming and sleep mode helps out lot in college
neutral,deep bass for small speaker also has great sounding highs too use it hours day at work and it doesn disappoint at all 
positive,this headset is possibly one of the best headsets ve ever gotten would recommend them to anyone looking for headset for noise cancellation and gaming 
neutral,a few days after the return window expired the scrolling wheel stopped working 
positive,it was okay at first it lagged lot know it wasn an issue with my laptop cause ve used wireless mouses of different types before so got this one after few days it completely stopped working even after charging it it refused to connect and work definitely won buy this again and letting my friend know not to get it either it was just letdown 
neutral,i had wireless mouse for over year and found the it was very unstable and track even when not being moved this one is solid as rock 
neutral,stopped working after months trash
negative,i bought one of these and in three months it completely stopped working couldn charge it or use it bought second one thinking the first one was bad one and the second one did the same thing buy something more reputable would not recommend buying this product 
neutral,disappointed in these headphones save your money and get better quality headphones it sounds good if you re just listening to it but when you have the mic on its horrible play cod on ps so much static and background noise you can even hear me 
neutral,don buy

neutral,the sound quality is excellent it cancelled all sounds
positive,this has been great addition to my gaming set up it perfect size for my year old who loves using it for homework
neutral,i ve ordered of these in year because the wire end never lasts
positive,i am college student so naturally need mouse that lights up the picture made the mouse look so cool with the lights but the white mouse ordered was more of transparent white so the lights made the mouse look like something bought at swap meet super cheap now for the function it worked great for few months then the sensor on the bottom started to get an attitude with me wanted to go to the right of my screen and it would want to go left attempted to perform an exorcism on it just in case there was demon possessing it either did it wrong or the demon was too powerful for my faith or the mouse is malfunctioning ll let you decide the storyline on that one prior to it becoming possessed it worked great and charged up fast the charger is old school not usb 
neutral,they last about year
neutral,everyone should be mentioning the radiation this speaker is emitting keep it at least two feet away don carry it around it emits high radiation even when it off 
neutral,we got this mouse for my teenage daughter and at first it worked great she only had it for weeks and it stopped working 
neutral,my grandson wears them alot
positive,my daughter loves them would highly recommend shipping is fast 
positive,i love this mouse 
negative,looks like the track wheel is connected to an internal device using very fragile thin piece of plastic was simply using the mouse didn drop it or slam it and suddenly the tactile feedback of using the track wheel stopped and the mouse would no longer scroll the screen too bad actually liked the mouse until then 
neutral,stopped working and wouldn re charge after few weeks threw it away 
negative,so sad been using for months only and the scroll wheel broke already bye bye scrolling feature kind of turn off to use it now that its broken

neutral,mouse worked great was easy to connect and use but stopped working and had to throw it away after months of use stopped charging stopped working all together 
positive,love my led light up mouse it very quiet and no more clicking noise yay thanks amazon
negative,purchased two connection between the speakers is good but the bluetooth connection between the source is by far the worst have ever had constant clipping does not matter if ft apart or lot of sound when connected but will drive you crazy with the clipping not worth the money not even worth half the price do not buy my mistake 
positive,this keyboard is the best keyboard ever owned my gaming have been better with it if you want own keyboard klim is the best 
positive,i no audiophile but have been amazed by the sound quality of this speaker hearing subtle sounds from my classic rock tracks that have never noticed and this compares to both bose wave and their portable brick friend has the version and think this has better sound the range is superior to any of the bluetooth speakers have used and just realized can keep the phone close because of the charging capabilities don know if these other reviewers were expecting live philharmonic sound quality because this speaker is awesome 
positive,i just got this in the mail opened the amazon box and found it like this haven even opened yet hope it not damaged 
neutral,straight out of the box the left click button doesn work completely useless sending back don waste your time like have 
positive,my son loves his headset would definitely order again he can hear clearly and is heard clearly

positive,perfect for any gamer and price is great 
positive,portabledecent weightstrong bassgreat upgrade from flip pairs well with flip to balance strong sound
positive,great portable speaker
positive,if you want to rock out to heavy base beat this is your speaker but for the spoken word it isn as good as much less expensive speakers 
positive,this mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use love the lights that constantly change while you re using it the best part for me is the fact that it rechargeable just plug it into any usb plug it into my laptop at the end of the day battery usually lasts me few full days of work sleep mode is great and helps prolong battery life 
neutral,it barely lasts few hours before having to recharge it which is annoying think it is because of the led lights which drain the power 
neutral,in my opinion this keyboard is not product worth the money various key functions did not work 
positive,the headset is comfortable and has good sound quality wish the mic was longer but thats really it 
positive,at noise levels befitting age subdued rock and rollers this speaker performs admirably 
neutral,first time charging this mouse started smelling burnt plastic smell in my home walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was lot stronger reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot had not been in that room it would have started fire not happy 
positive,love it
neutral,in less than months after purchasing the scrolling wheel stopped working 
positive,it the best speaker ever bought it has an clear sound and the lost frequency mode is insane the bass is amazing the price is good for all the speaker has offers to you
neutral,i ve had the mouse less than months and both the roller wheel and the piece that plugs into the usb port both broke managed to super glue the roller wheel back together but it just broke again buy slightly better mouse if you can not sure if all the reviews are even real 
positive,can plug into all kinds of hardware instructions easy to follow amazon had great shipping very timely sound and microphone work awesomely 
positive,pretty good sound and audio quality for the price fits well and can wear for long periods of time 
negative,it very cute but it lags and skips around lot unfortunately 
neutral,does not come with case do your research so you don have to spend alot more money for one 
neutral,didn work
neutral,if you want an led mouse for aesthetics dont buy this brand this has flashing red led that is seperate from the rgb leds it stays on even when the led switch is not on 
negative,idk about sound cancelling but my son hasn complained about it he into gaming and animations kingfuture is his name 
positive,after months stopped working none of the key functions work the keyboard is fully charged should have read the negative reviews like others have said stopped working right after the return window closed also for what this cost the lighting on it should stay on constant but it doesn you have to hit key for it to come on they charge way too much for this piece of garbage amazon needs to give more than month window for returns guess ll stick to best buy for electronics if could have gave it less than one star would have 
positive,i love it great to use 
neutral,this is compact slim mouse wouldn call it ergonomic just efficiently sized just opened it and already hate it it isn silent the buttons are loud and non responsive ve had to click multiple times to get response from the mhouse and only heavy loud click works ll be returning and will continue the hunt for replacement mouse it does look cool but performs poorly 
negative,doesn charge fast the scroll broke within days the mouse completely stopped working after few weeks it constantly would stick 
positive,this speaker sounds fantastic and has great look thought it didn come with charging cable but it is actually in the back of the box in thin cardboard sleeve 
positive,only months old and already won charge pretty but not very long lasting
neutral,i needed this for work rechargeable nice looking easy to use but broke after weeks
positive,my son is gamer and he loves them 
positive,it moves well and like that can turn it off if not using it 
neutral,this so slim not comfortable for men with average size hand maybe children can use it not sure how this things got star reviews believe most star reviews are made by paid promoters 
positive,works perfectly battery lasts really long time excellent sound quality 
positive,cute and fun to watch while using
positive,son loved them 
positive,i loved this mouse until it quit working three weeks after using am unable to return it due to return window tried different mouse pads and notebooks hoping was just the material it was sensitive to 
neutral,looks beautiful but couldn get it to sink to my macbook air saddened
positive,we use this as our portable backyard poolside speaker it produces surprisingly high volume and sound quality out of such small package very happy with the purchase 
neutral,the wheel for scrolling breaks to easily this is the second one that ve purchased with the same issue will try another brand 
positive,i got my headset few days after ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so notified them and right then and there they replaced it with red one as requested because it just goes along with my computer no questions asked the headset looks awesome love the lights anyway besides the awesome lights this has got to be one of the most decent sound wise quality and most awesome looking headsets out there and for very sweet price mean price like that for headset like this is very cheap repeat the price is very cheap for what this headphone worth if you re gamer and do not want to spend crap ton of money for decent headset you might want to try this 
neutral,the scroll wheel stopped working days after bought it used it less than times
negative,battery life seems to be decent have two of these and both have issues with the dpi randomly changing itself so have to click the button to change it numerous times day every now and then the one use at home doesn connect when turning on the computer have to unplug re plug the dongle do have it plugged into usb switch but seeing as it the only device that encounters this issue don believe the problem is the switch not likely to buy this again it been too frustrating 
neutral,didn even work sensitivity way to fast
positive,this mouse has been great super quiet when you click and responds well when prompted the lights add nice touch and remind you to turn it off for the day 
positive,i received the kotion each by bengoo headphones last christmas as gift thought for sure these were headphones when tried them on my ps they sounded great and gave my girlfriend peace because she now did not have to hear rdr constantly could fish ride horses hunt and have shootouts with outlaws all day long do not play online so cannot say to the microphone quality but have used it few times on zoom calls and no one had issues hearing me am also musician and filmmaker and am very picky about sound quality let be clear crystal clear get it these are not sennheiser headphones but they are very good quality for the price for casual use could not believe the price when looked them up would edit an album or film with these yes for rough cutting but would grab something more reputable for sound final mixing for video and definitely not use these for sound mixing music the mix coming out of these is little on the bass side for me but not enough one couldn get used to in few minutes and only know they are slightly bass because my ear is trained to hear that stuff most people will not notice this at all they have lasted just fine for year and are still going light plastic body but nothing has fallen off it yet also take very good care of my things and do not toss them on tables couches etc so cannot speak to how robust they are for people who like to throw things across rooms do not ever pull on the cord etc mine came with split connector mm usb which does come in handy sometimes but the extra dangly cord not being used can be annoying also the cord is waaaaay long feet ish which is great and also annoying depending on your usage but would take more cord than not enough any day the in line volume knob is great for when different streaming services like to pump out different volumes and your ears get blasted when your show starts no need to get up and change the computer volume just lay on the couch and adjust the dial on the cord reversely the dial is great to pump up the volume bit for those highly compressed videos on the web that are too low to hear overall it gets stars if it had treble bass adjustment knob it would get cheers to your ears 
positive,bought it months ago works perfectly 
negative,very nice sleek design was expecting lot more given the reviews but mouse stopped working after weeks the usb and usb adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending so as soon as go to plug it into my computer it does not connect definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for product to use for about week or two 
neutral,the dpi sensor stopped working after couple of days don buy it
positive,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additionally with the hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price
neutral,very lightweight and like the looks of it but the right click button stopped working after few months
positive,not waterproof started to sound fuzzy after months of using it great if it going to be indoors and not in extreme conditions 
positive,super
positive,straight out of the box it is sleek and feels good in my hand however it does not read on or off the mousepad very disappointed 
positive,works very well best part is charging the mouse through power chord rather than batteries 
negative,the mouse functions well especially like the colorful lights however the battery is kind of pain it lasts for only days even when it is in sleep mode have to remember to charge it everyday which unfortunately am not good at ended up using my old mouse as backup every few days 
neutral,first time that need to change the battery and it doesnt work anymore no duro ni meses 
positive,this keyboard is so awesome will buy another when necessary we have projector connected to our computer and this keyboard helps when trying to watch movies in the dark 
positive,great brand speaker has lot of bass perfect for home or on the go in my opinion this speak tops the beats pill 
positive,it great the only reason didn give stars is because the lights go off almost as soon as you stop typing understand that it has an energy saver to keep you from constantly recharging it but seconds would have been perfect you barely can enjoy the effects as far as being loud it not loud to me don what kind of silent vortex these other people need to be in but it quiet enough keyboard 
positive,what speaker jbl never disappoints we use this speaker all the time battery life is really good better than expected recommend this speaker to all 
positive,i use this for my laptop mostly when creating designs on my cricut works good lights up very nicely 
positive,this little thing sounds great 
neutral,i purchased this keyboard in may and it now july use this keyboard for gaming so do use it quite bit which is why purchased it in the first place going off the reviews already having keys stick not working which shouldn be happening since ve only had it for less than months it worked great up until this last week but guess going to have to look into another keyboard now 
positive,love this speaker very easy to set up and use great sound quality battery lasts forever 
neutral,it for my laptop doing graphic design
neutral,it very nice
neutral,yup 
positive,love the overall look love how it can light up for when play at night the noise cancellation is awesome really great product invested in
neutral,as advertised
neutral,it very good
neutral,my speaker will not accept any additional charge and turns off within few minutes of playing music have tried the factory reset but think it may be hardware issue 
positive,this mouse is super cute it is lightweight and the color matched perfectly to the picture got dark gray to match my macbook pro the click is silent which love the led lights are bright and colorful there is also setting where you can just have red lights but love the color changing the only downside is that this mouse does not hold charge long enough to last my entire workday ve started switching it off when am away from my desk and that help some charging is simple though 
neutral,charger not included it good speaker but wish the battery life lasted bit longer 
negative,this is the worst wireless mouse ve ever had the displeasure of using bought it thinking how bad can it really be it just needs to connect to my laptop well if this could be negative star rating would do it if you stop moving the mouse for seconds or more you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn respond to your movements it doesn have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use it is garbage 
neutral,this product only lasted days thought it was not charged but it not that
positive,this is an awesome mouse it is slender build so it fits small hand the lights are totally fun when you click the buttons it is strong click so that you know you have clicked on something it also has quick response on the computer it has an off on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won use up the batteries will be buying one for my daughter it is awesome 
positive,i love it silently clicks automatically goes to sleep conserving battery and slick design
negative,very disappointed bought this for my kindergarten classroom and the kids loved it last week it totally went black no more cool lights no more nothing after months it does not work beware if you want to use if for long period of time 
neutral,it worked very well till it didn anymore bought this in january and it won charge or do anything very disappointed
neutral,works well worth it
neutral,cant hear that well doesnt light up as stated in ad 
neutral,i like the fact that it lights not only can you see it in the dark but it alerts you when the batteries or low
positive, this mouse is lightweight it charges fast by small cable which is included it does not take batteries it puts on light show of colors fun for adults or children this can easily be turned off by switch on the bottom of the mouse the mouse itself is easy to assemble there is small usb plug that clips to the bottom of the mouse for storage when you are not using it this plugs into your computers usb port when you do use it this is great mouse to use as backup the color is great also review title great spare mouse
neutral,very goo mic and the sound quality is good 
neutral,i like not having to replace batteries all of the time and also the sleek design and color 
positive,the nose cancellation is plus and works great for what bought it for my son loves it for his gaming 
neutral,do not buy this complete junk too small
neutral,this mouse has very poor sensor it will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for bit and you sometimes have to click the dpi button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up the sensor also cannot move fast if try moving the mouse quickly the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like deja vu is playing in the background speaking of clicks the left mouse button double clicks quite bit the only thing this mouse has going for it is its design even then the design is uncomfortable since its so flat find better mouse please don torture yourself with this 
negative,it worked for the first hour bought it went to charge it it no longer works turns on or charges 
neutral,works for nintendo switch
neutral,nice speaker
neutral,broke within week of having it 
positive,great portable speaker that sounds great 
neutral,not very loud sound is ok
positive,my son loved the headsets definitely great putchase
neutral,it broke after being used for one week
negative,bad sound
neutral,it doesn stay charged and it feels too light weight in your hand 
neutral,feels durable and not fragile like the others worth the couple extra bucks over victsing 
negative,battery life is great being able to use it as charger for other devices like to charge cell phone also major plus but where it suffers is the sound quality as others have mentioned the mono speaker is definitely weak point though the bass output is decent for its size the speaker barely seems to get as loud as our flip also when connected via bluetooth to our samsung tv for is quite noticeable lag in audio once again in comparison to the flip 
positive,amazing speaker 
positive,this is great keyboard and really enjoyed it 
positive,the mouse lasts good while on charge as it shuts itself off good product 
positive,i purchased this headset on wednesday and got it by friday really fast which was great now the sound is really great better than the one currently have im glad made the switch 
positive,i love this can have stereo quality music anywhere the charger lasts long time so thrilled with jbl charge you will be too recommend buying the carrying case also 
neutral,i ordered these for myself my current headset just reached the end of it life and needs replaced these appeared similar and were near the same in price but oh boy the quality first off unless you have an extremely tiny head or are child these are not for you the ear cuffs are absurdly small had my japanese roommate try them on and even he laughed at how ridiculously tiny they were there no way you could wear these for any length of time without getting headache from the pressure to your ears but hey maybe they ll sound great and can get past that nope the audio was muffled and quiet had to turn my volume up five fold to hear anything compared to my worn out set the set that literally falling part sound better come on all of this comes after waiting much longer delivery time than quoted by almost week and when the package did arrive it was crushed headset seemed unharmed but with the sound quality who knows maybe that factor can say all can say is that these are absolute junk 
positive,cute mouse just love how it lights up with the different colors 
positive,this is so pretty fits my hand perfect the lights are soooo pretty lol it was beyond easy to set up on my laptop it came partially charged even so could use right out the box easy to charge lasts really long time too love it would totally gift 
neutral,if you can spend the extra money and buy something little better quality
positive,i love how you can plug it into usb charger or into the usb on the device to charge say durable because have dropped mine stepped on it you make it and it still works as good as day one 
positive, quality is good dunno yet how ling the battery life is but just make sure to charge before going somewhere recommended 
positive,great portable bluetooth speaker max volume could be better but certainly recommend the purchase 
neutral,good product timely shipping 
neutral,if you have intent on using this for anything other than typing good luck the keys are weirdly spaced it membrane and not mechanical and the position for some of the outer function keys are weird 
neutral,sounds is decent can hear other crisp and clear if you want the lights to work plug in the usb long cable so you aren tied so close to your device controller 
neutral,the mouse is fine but the scroll button started squeaking almost immediately and is pretty annoying 
positive,it was cute and worked super well while it lasted but about weeks into using it it just stops doesn hold charge doesn stay on of course it lasts beyond when you can return it so just don take the chance 
neutral,i had different models was time for new one since going out town ship was fast but the thing would not stay connected to any phone for music or call sent back and had to go purchase from store and pay little more but no issues and sounds great sent back got refund for broken one understand that not seller fault they can test new equipment and not all will function out box correctly so for the hassle gave stars
neutral,so far ok needs bluetooth up grade
positive,i bought these for my son and daughter and they love them my son is and huge gamer and my daughter is and constantly chatting with someone super happy with the item definitely worth the money 
positive,this mouse doesn work it may go few days of being ok but it doesn track properly and takes several minutes to start working then it ll go days without working at all charge it for hours at time so know that not the problem 
negative,when opened the box containing the product bunch of white powder feel out not sure what it is but it very unsettling checked for silica packet or something it could have come from but found nothing washed really well but my hands are itching now might be an allergic reaction 
positive,amazing little mouse
positive,the price on this headset was unbeatable have had them for months and can believe how good they sound especially for the price point and they have held up with nothing breaking they are very comfortable and have had several hour gaming sessions with no complaints they don sound as good as the sony bluetooth set have but they were more expensive so didn expect them to the led lights are cool but fortunately you can not use them by not plugging in the usb connection if you are looking for comfortable decent sounding wired headset for great price look no further 
neutral,just wished it ll light up without being plugged in
negative,maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting if you hold it in front of you you can immediately notice that there no sound coming from the left side initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mono did more research and learned it was designed that way the sound quality is still excellent just personally can look past the unequal sound distribution 
positive,looks great feels comfortable however when lifting the mouse it would shoot the cursor all over the screen which can be frustrating when playing games or working on detailed spreadsheets 
positive,works fine easy to install and use but there is nothing quiet about this keyboard it clacks along just like regular one not advertised as quiet 
neutral,broke within week it cute and all but not worth it 
neutral,cheap quality and it broke quickly save your money for something more durable
neutral,i think it great for gaming although the cord is bit heavier it not big problem love the headset 
negative,i bought this after my xiberia headset broke and was blown away by how much of downgrade it was might actually tape up the xiberia to use it instead of this the sound quality on these is bad there are weird whining noises in the earpiece whenever people talk to me it has separate usb port which thought would be nice but its only purpose is to turn on the lights no joke this is waste of spend bit more and get pair of xiberias here instead 
neutral,jbl speakers are trash when it comes to battery had the jbl xtreme and the battery wouldn hold charge it had to be plugged in to use it finally threw that one in the garbage and bought the charge three weeks in and the speaker won charge at all the sound quality isn that great either sucky bass and only has one speaker on the right side it not worth what it costs this speaker should be no more than returning this crap and gonna look into better speaker don waste your time 
neutral,cheap easy to use and keeps up with your needs
positive,these headphones are amazing they re soundproof too love the price they re very affordable and compatible with almost every console and pcs so happy with my purchase will buy again 
neutral,doesn work 
neutral,after just three months this mouse no longer charges so it useless spend few extra dollars and get better mouse 
neutral,i never write reviews as matter of fact this is the first have ever written but due to the danger factor felt compelled to my son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire 
positive,i spend lot of time working with music esp mixing mastering composing wanted speaker could enjoy while was at the skatepark my friends something that could get loud and sound really good heard jbl was pretty popular and had good reputation but was dissappointed with the charge in terms of build quality it nice speaker it feels sturdy and looks good but as soon as turned on song was shocked by the quality of audio the mid frequencies were boosted and they made audio sound muddy and unpleasant for speaker that was real letdown checked out their app hoping for some sort of software update tune up but it very bare bones and didn have anything to help also checked if bass mode was on and it was from the start went into my phone eq settings and manually changed the spectrum to my liking if you own this speaker recommend you moderately raise the lows duck the mids and raise the highs that made the speaker lot more pleasant but as soon as did that it took loss on its max volume the skatepark go to is pretty small but has metal ramps that get loud this speaker wasn enough for the park it definitely okay if you re at small picnic in an apartment etc but it doesn get as loud as was hoping overall this speaker isn worth the price for an allegedly reputable brand it absurd the sound quality doesn come good from the start it felt like paid for jbl logo what think ll do is buy from cheaper brand and do the eq tuning myself hope this helps have good week 
positive,love it 
positive,i love this thing live on cal fire center and all my buddies here love this thing definitely would recommend the sound on this thing bumps battery life is great as well and best part about it is it charges your phone too if you connect it through usb 
positive,great
neutral,cleanest bass in the bluetooth speaker out of tried tried the doss bose soundlink jbl flip jbl charge and megaboom out of all these the jbl charge had the cleanest bass and clearest vocals without distortion at large volumes 
positive,i love this speaker great sound super durable and long lasting 
neutral,scroll wheel broke after one day only used for less than an hour and it no longer scrolls and isn connected in the correct position anymore very light use hopefully replacement will be better quality if remember ll update review after using replacement 
positive,silent clicks works great takes getting used to lower profile not having to worry about battery is golden 
neutral,the scrolling mechanism stopped working within minutes of use didn drop it or handle it improperly it just piece of junk 
positive,sound is great very loud love it
neutral,i used every way possible no sound no anything 
positive,it is so nice to use it with my laptop
neutral,for my laptop and received it the next day 
positive,love it 
neutral,the enter key is weirdly shaped the back lights do not stay on unless am typing and the key sticks use for work not gaming it is too much trouble to return but will not buy again 
positive,i feel like see this speaker everywhere and it great speaker super loud and great quality for the size price no complaints there have main issues too much bass think it crazy to say for speaker like this but it true sounds great for some songs too muddy in others don need eq settings but bass boost on off would be nice there no way to go back one song with the speaker controls this is legitimately frustrating ve read the manual and googled it but the controls let you adjust volume play pause and skip to the next song can go back and replay song without going back to my phone to control it 
negative,i tried to give this mouse some time tried it on different surfaces in all cases it skipped around and was very hard to work with unfortunately because of vacation and because tried to make it work missed the return window by one day that just frustrates me even more 
negative,the mouse was stunning when first got it it was very fluent but the one problem and very major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time right clicked and my chromebook didn have setting to fix it overall it was just an annoying issue 
negative,might work for low use we shall see and ll update this review after week or so of use update received aug mouse died sep rip
neutral,it turned on and that is about all it did it wouldn move the cursor tried different mouse pads and surfaces and finally gave up 
positive,bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it and then wished kept it for myself 
neutral,usb adapter doesn work and light on mouse fuzzes out when plugged into different computer that allows for usb 
positive,the product is just fine looks like jbl but clearly they lied about hours worth of music battery life plan on returning it and just going to big box store next time 
positive,amazijg at all live with my roommates but could focus on my own stuff with this headset thank you 
positive,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer 
neutral,hit the key and it also types the key these keys aren even near each other 
negative,i ve been throwing pair of these in pools hot tubs the lake my favorite party trick is the bass spraying water off the sides when you take it out of the water yes these are mono thats why you buy two and they pair up with just single button press on each you do have to use the jbl app to marry them into stereo mode but hell you can even sync bose speakers without an app my only complaint with these they don play music under water lol seriously get two you won be disappointed the battery wore out in my renewed one bought for can complain because it owes me nothing and ordered an upgraded battery for it for which brings it to the full price of one of these after beating on it for years literally beating on it taking them everywhere 
positive,purchased for my friend to use with her zoom classes works great with ipad chromebook and computer so far love it
negative, update after using the mouse for around days it just completely stopped working the lights come on and it appears to charge but the buttons no longer work and the optical lens doesn pick up any movement don even bother with this it trash not very reliable mouse after just couple days of use it stops working intermittently which is frustrating wouldn purchase again that said it is very quiet mouse with no audible click and it good size 
positive,it responds very well and is easy to use 
negative,it has too much lag it slow that why hate it
neutral,would not recommend

positive,haven set it up yet its christmas gift for my year old son arrived quickly and looks great will review after he uses it 
positive,as far as gaming is concerned not using it for that using it because have diabetic retinopathy and it helps with seeing the keys the brightness is perfect the battery life have not ran into problem have used it when my computer is docked and several days have gone by without charging it again so to me that great 
neutral,great sound however stopped working with no sound after only over year contacted jbl only one year warranty they only offered discount code to buy another speaker no thanks 
positive,great quality and great price
neutral,ther is nothing bad to say about these headphones
positive,have previous experience with jbl and it was natural choice to buy this was not disappointed
positive,i am an adult with smaller head and sometimes feel like these headphones are slipping off when gaming but that is really the only complaint have tend to just use one of my beanies to keep it from slipping don like the cutesy headphones they make for smaller heads that why chose this one otherwise like these headphones alot 
positive,this speaker sounds great and has an awesome battery life haven tested the water proofing yet but so far love this speaker
neutral,have used this mouse for more than month now the cursor jumps around unreliably on the screen making it difficult to navigate battery life is not very long before needs recharging feels very cheaply made in hand do not recommend 
positive,my daughter loves it cute color and works great 
positive,if you have normal size ears they won fit to small if you have normal size head they won fit to big and hang down past ears 
neutral,it stopped working after weeks the lights would appear and it looked like it would charge but the mouse was nonresponsive to movement it worked for week or two before this happened so know how it was supposed to work before it stopped working the surface felt silky to the touch but that about the only plus can give this product as cool as the lights look wouldn recommend wasting your money on this invest little extra and go with more reputable and reliable brand that won break after weeks ll be doing the same after this disappointment 
neutral,mouse seems to work ok looks nice easy install etc biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature every time go to use the pc it asleep then have to either click button which may may not cause an action on the pc or pick it up and down several times too annoying so stopped using it might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling definitely not for daily use 
positive,decent enough sound quality but already have quality headphones for audio the product is borderline unusable because whenever use push to talk feature it just plays whatever sounds it making back into the mic as input my friends cannot hear me all they can hear is game sound whatever song have on laughably terrible feature it almost be better if it just didn input anything 
positive,great product 
positive,amazing headphones for gaming great product recommend them 
neutral,it hi quality

neutral,all did was turn the mic and out of nowhere it just broke off
positive,the mouse is very slim but is so cheaply made don dare drop it or it going to break won by another one
positive,product is awesome very soft and silent great for gaming

positive,great sound quality and battery life
positive,recommended to me by friend great colors and good sound 
positive,works great
positive,i love jbl
neutral,item received charger does not work
negative,right out the box noticed the very plastic cheap feel the rbg lights are bright but honestly bought it for cheap mouse after using it for while the wrist did start hurting little the worse part is after it died for the first time did full charge and it has not worked since sure can go through the warranty but ll just take the loss you get what you paid for 
positive,i use this mouse for casual surfing and scrolling no gaming but it smooth and responsive and looks awesome 
neutral,i was super exited about this product for my laptop sadly it didn even work after week tried everything to get this mouse to work charging for two days try it on different computer nothing helped the mouse didn even use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements 
neutral,loved this but based on other reviews not the only one with this issue stopped recharging and working after months 
positive,i was so excited to receive this mouse chose it because the color with so nice bought it in mint green and the features of the multicolor led lights however to my surprise this mouse doesn hold charge after maybe two hours of use it done and needs to be charged for few hours in order to be used again naturally went back to my original apple mouse 
positive,for the price the quality is really good they don hurt my ears or my head super easy to control the volume and the lights on the side are pretty sweet highly recommend these 
positive,everything arrived and performs great 
positive,love the way the music or movie sounds through this speaker the best ever bought very happy 
positive,i just got and they work pretty well 
neutral,the wireless feature and recharging from computer 
neutral,cute mouse but that about it very flimsy and poor quality feeling like that it rechargeable ve had this for few months now and it stopped working it charged clean clear of debris and on mousepad but still doesn work for more than few seconds waste of money

positive,this was christmas gift and the recipient was thrilled to death when gift was opened was given demonstration soon after gift was opened looked great with the changing colors of the device 
neutral,i have to say impressed not only does it light up but accidentally dropped it in dog bowl full of water and it still works can ask for more than that for the price 
positive,looks and works amazing use it for xbox and the sound quality is very very good especially for the price and also looks very pretty 
neutral,i ve tried and tried to set up the microphone to work can hear everyone talking but no one can hear my voice using laptop and non of the laptop today has two plug ins for the microphone and speaker one is pink and one in green the microphone is on but the pc system doesn know about the device ve tried different laptops none of them works 
positive,i purchased two of these one works of the time get some ghost keys and missed keys but it is something can live with this second keyboard though wow just wow maybe half the keys work at most charged it up tried multiple computers oses etc same result get maybe half the keys working it is very random too as to when it happens and which keys spend little extra and get something that is actually worth it and if you are worried about accuracy buy wired

positive,best portable speaker ve ever bought or heard take this thing everywhere perfect for camping fishing in the backpack hiking in the bathroom showering recommend and purchase again

neutral,i bought this keyboard twice once months ago and again few weeks ago have two computers one for work and one for personal use both times when moved the usb port from one computer to another received an error and my computer did not recognize the usb tried the internal usb ports along with the hubs have for each computer do not make the mistake made do not give this product first chance 
neutral,thank you 
neutral,they stopped working after week
neutral,worked for less than month it won charge real piece of junk not great product 
neutral,i bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design after using it for awhile plugged it in charged it worked for awhile then it would only work for few hours then not at all when plugged it in noticed that had to move the connection where it plugs into the device to the left then it would light up but if let go nothing would not recommend this product 
positive,that was my first review but the mouse did not work the seller replaced it immediately and that one works fine again be aware that this is rechargeable mouse and you cannot replace the batteriesthe seller should ve been clearer that this is recharging mouse and don know how you replace the rechargeable batteries so that the only complaintotherwise it great mouse
neutral,this mouse is ergonomic light weight and very easy to use unfortunately the color shown in the picture for rose gold was not very accurate it is much darker would still buy it again though 
positive,i don like how you can change the keycaps also don like how you have to click the middle of the space bar and can just click the side

neutral,did not function even after charging and plugging it in returned 
positive,i bought this for my son birthday and he absolutely loves them would definitely buy again 
positive,got good deal nice item was exactly as described 
negative,i purchased this item because of the backlighting planned to use it in our living room at night to interact with our tv the backlighting is great like the feel of the keyboard but yesterday connected it to my desktop was having problems when would hit the return key with my left pinky after comparing the klim with the worn out logitech am replacing found that there is an extra key between the quotation mark key and the enter key the backslash key has been moved down row if were hunt and peck typist suppose this would be fine but learned to touch type years ago use my touch typing skills many times day why would want to teach myself how to find the enter key all over again to press key thinking that am using the enter key and then finding that have backslash or that the item failed to load is maddening dislike giving low score to such good looking keyboard but if buyers have the same concern as do they need to know what they are buying would also prefer larger delete key 
neutral,the wheel stopped working after weeks
positive,bought as temporary replacement for my gamer son when his started messing up lot and he is very tall and they barely fit but he does like them and says they work good until he can find pair he would like to get so great price for temporary fix

neutral,this is not good product we all know the number of good reviews online for this item are inflated by bots was feeling cheap and ordered this headset as replacement and it was even worse than expected the fit is terrible the materials are hilariously cheap and the mic was broken out of the box the joke is on me for ordering these be smarter than am 
neutral,keyboard is small and ok not strong lighting in the light my main issue is that the volume up and down don work to me this makes this non purchase

positive,ok tried everything in the world to get this keyboard to work plugged the dongal into the usb port charged it up overnight and finally restarted the computer looked at the bottom of the keyboard and saw nothing but there is very tiny button that blends in with the rest of the keyboard which is in the off position when it first arrives turn the button on this message is for people who haven had to buy new keyboard in million years like me hope it helps all the non techie people out there love the colors on the keyboard and because of my set up the keyboard is in fairly dark area in pull out beneath the desk so this is really really helpful very light to the touch as advertised not gamer but you don have to be to appreciate this keyboard 
positive,works great with my mac book pro 
neutral,my son received these headphones for xmas months ago they worked great for the most part the switch to turn the mic on and off was touchy he occasionally have to flip it back and forth to get it to work he said sound was great and noise canceling was ok the worst part is that he was using it today and the cable cord just came apart as far as know it not fixable unless get soldering gun but have no idea how to do any of that we have one bummed kiddo

neutral,it was ok while it worked prefer battery to having to charge it via usb only worked months and the roller mechanism broke 
neutral,good headset for gaming

negative,i ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen even when it was fully charged figured just got bad apple so made an exchange for new one the new mouse came scratched not big deal and the scroll wheel wasn as smooth annoying but its fine but this one cursor is jumping around the screen too would have otherwise liked the mouse it charges up quickly and appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer

positive,like it very much great price great performance and cute too 
neutral,only used it few times and like it 
positive,i purchased this with the hope to use it for my home office to get rid of my corded mouse was very surprised when was scrolling and all of the sudden the scroller seemed to sink deeper into the mouse took it apart in hopes to fix it only to find that the scroller just snapped off 
neutral,product is very good 
neutral,the rose gold color is very pretty and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors there is an option to turn the colors off but you end up with red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around it will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to logitech or name brand get what you pay for in this case 
positive,my year old son loves this headset he just received it for his birthday we haven texted all of the features and aren sure if the mic works yet but he still enjoying it update mic works and he very happy with the gift

positive,bought this for our boat amazing sound and now were using it for outdoor movies in the backyard and camping love this product
negative,the headset itself is pretty but it big on my head without the ability to adjust the lights on mine don turn on no matter what do the sound quality isn bad it just isn loud at all even at the highest setting still use them for horror games but if you like your games loud wouldn recommend this headset 
positive,my brother loved this headphone
neutral,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the scroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the scroll wheel mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty 
positive,my three cents just the jbl charge and the portable speaker bass and sound quality are great for the price you can charge it while using it so it doesn need to be portable 
neutral,for the price it good to use for gaming with other players over the ps system
positive,feels and sounds great the audio is amazing and the lights are so nice
neutral,this product only lasted days thought it was not charged but it not that

positive,i could afford way more expensive keyboard but honestly love this one
positive,my son love this headphones for gaming 
positive,really disappointed wanted to love this product but the usb adapter that came with it doesn fit into my usb port it looks like it only goes half way in so basically the product is useless the mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate wish the adapter worked
positive,was so excited for this mouse loved the style and lights when ordered it once received it used it for approx half day and then it died and never turned back on charged it through the pc for quite while when realized it hadnt charged tried wall outlet never turned back on went through some of the reviews after and realized it was running theme and that many other customers had the same experience dont waste your time

neutral,not great quality but it works fine lights up

positive,loves
positive,works great would highly recommend
neutral,waste of money never charged and never worked waited to late to return so it ll go in the trash 
positive,this speaker sounds great as long as it is in the same room as your music source the sound counts in and out as soon as you walk around corner 
positive,i gave gaming star because don do gaming the mouse is worth every penny love how it feels love that it makes no noise you must use mouse pad 
neutral,i purchased this item in august the usb plug completely fell apart and can no longer use the mouse 
negative,first removed the charging cable from the box and found that the wire was broken and figured could find another cable but then pulled out the mouse and it was broken as well the top half of the mouse was broken off from the bottom half needless to say returned the product for refund 
negative,v was ok slightly bigger kinda cooler looking but they ve had time to dial in the planned obsolescence battery died year and week after purchase thumbs waaaay down bought and done with jbl 
neutral,it has already stopped working the little roller on top stop working
positive,great product
positive,it was fine until it just stopped working months in do yourself favor and spend little more money to get well known brand like logitech 
positive,the sound quality is on par maybe slightly better than other units in this price point easy to wear not heavy at all the noise canceling is not the best but was not expecting anything crazy good works well for the kids when gaming the lights give it that wow factor for the kids no issues here 
positive,i purchased this for my year old grandson and he loves it he takes it everywhere with him great buy 
negative,i had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just weeks would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen every task on the computer began to take the amount of time it used to had to resort to using the trackpad on my macbook which not fan of definitely don get this mouse not worth it 
positive,my son loves the product has not had any issues the headset is clear 
positive,first the price is very affordable it light weight and it works very well the perfect part is it doesn make any sound love the product am very satisfied
neutral,never worked had to return it wouldn connect after charging x
positive,i absolutely love this speaker for work would like more if it gave notice to charge before it just shuts off
neutral,good sound quality
positive,it was very jittery on occasion went to replace it because it was quick buy to get me by until could afford better solution solution it served purpose but wouldn recommend the purchase if you could avoid it 
neutral,i purchased this mouse for my chromebook which only has mousepad enjoy that it really lights up it is lightweight and an easy glide finish it wireless and rechargable the wireless adapter fits in the bottom of the mouse so you don lose it 
positive,works like any headphones should good sound the microphone works good lots of noise reduction although the usb isn extendable or detachable while it can be mostly ignored it would be nice if it could be removed
positive,works great 
neutral,this mouse is almost unusable because of how loud every scroll is took the top off to make sure there wasn something stuck in there to create this awful sound and it was clean just poorly designed cheap wasn expecting the greatest mouse for this low price point but this is just obnoxious 
negative,i was saddened when the product didn work at all my kids needed new wireless mouse and they did everything they were supposed to do and it didn work at all will not be buying again 
positive,i just tryna find out how to turn the led light on but it great set overall 
positive,this speaker is great it price is worth it especially when it was on sale great sound and it can loud enough for outside use too 
negative,this mouse was delivered missing of the track strips on the bottom of the mouse decided to use it anyways since that shouldn impact the function it worked for few days and then started having problems have to click several times before can get response from it it also barely holds charge 
positive,i like the mouse it operates excellent and the light show is great everything wanted when bought it thank you very cool and functional 
neutral,i honestly don care for this at all sure it cute but it not comfortable on the ears the sound is not very loud and the quality is low have issues with it constantly where people can hear me and know it not the controller would not recommend 
negative,mouse no longer will charge or hold charge even after attempting to charge for nights waste of my money 
neutral,this mouse is cheap and like the colors but the laser isn accurate so it can be slow and laggy occasionally its entirely unresponsive 
positive,my daughter loves it no complaints here 
neutral,only cool thing is the lights and they don work unless you plug in usb cheap cord broke within month wou
positive,this little mouse is great no need to use batteries connection was easy peasy
positive,first off love the color it what made me purchase it in the first place didn need mouse but like having spare now for my review as far as what used to for comfort this mouse sits flat so be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time fits nicely in your hand have medium small hands so please take that into consideration with the review the lights loved the different light modes it actually made it feel like had gaming mouse while not being so hard on my wallet now for push button response my right click wasn working properly barely clicked down and would sometimes mia click from it being mispositioned had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad broke it off and now it is clicking as intended so please be aware this is all very fragile plastic within its housing overall the mouse is great if you need spare and would buy again if needed another hate out of stars because feels worse than but feel an is more accurate to how feel as it has lot of great features such as charging vs batteries and an included usb adapter overall wonderful product that do recommend
negative,i loved this keyboard when first started using it but that didn last very long haven even been using this keyboard for full month yet and it quit working completely such waste of time completely useless for working from home the usb stays plugged in all the time so can use the wireless capability but it just quit charging can press key and then it completely dies even if plug in the usb cord it will light up but no matter what key press it does absolutely nothing am returning this asap don waste your time or money garbage
neutral,i like music batter
neutral,battery is running quickly have to charge every two weeks 
positive,i had high hopes for this jbl charge it good name brand with good reviews gave it shot but couldn get used the the mono sound and the fact there no equalizer my ears just weren happy the bluetooth worked great it solid and connected every time with no issues battery life seems good though haven kept it long enough to actually confirm this am returning it and keeping the soundcore motion boom which purchased week later as comparison it stereo sound far more superior and can be paired with an equalizer phone app therefore the charge is going back 
positive,truly amazing product
neutral,i like the sound and baterry life
positive,it looks good feels good but won hold charge for even minutes 
positive,great sound durability color everything wanted dont hesitate buy it already 
neutral,good overall product in sound quality connectivity battery life 
positive,love it teacher and the kids love to watch the color change it has soft click so is perfect for progress monitoring so students don hear the click no more messing with batteries stays charged for long time buy another one in heartbeat 
negative,it been about months since bought this the piece that goes into your laptop to make it wireless completely fell apart and mouse no longer clicks would not recommend
positive,i got this keyboard to use for streaming as frequently need to move my keyboard depending on if gaming or using my desk space for my stream so far really like it the keys have good resistance but are not overly noisy the color on it is great and not distracting my only small complaint with the keyboard having the backslash key next to the enter key as ll frequently be trying to hit enter and hit that key instead because of the odd shape of the key but other than that have been very impressed with this keyboard especially at the price point 
positive,love this little speaker the battery lasts forever not ton of bass but it sounds great 
positive,my son old headset was on its last leg he loves this one especially the retractable microphone 
positive,love this item works great never needs batteries light portable
neutral,i like the raised keys not using for gaming but for work what dislike is that it doesn have setting for backlight to stay on which is what wanted 
positive,i purchased these for my son he really loves them best headphones have purchased 
neutral,it stopped working only after months 
neutral,just opened the package and doesn even work
positive,love it
neutral,the mic sounded as if were trying to communicate with you from another level in the house 
neutral,first time charging this mouse started smelling burnt plastic smell in my home walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was lot stronger reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot had not been in that room it would have started fire not happy 
positive,it surely is not mechanical keyboard but it has great lighting and satisfying tactile response for the price though it can be beat
neutral,if your looking for loud speaker don buy this buy the wonderboom it cheaper in price and better sound quality 
positive,it comes already big doesn really fit well the cables are to short for spreading requires you to plug into the console to use the led lights wasn pleased but the sound quality and noise cancellation works great 
negative,it viable headset for the price do not expect the best sound quality
positive,working great
neutral,yeah no the roller fell inside had barely used it
negative,the mouse look and feel is nice and sleek but it does not slide well due to the bottom strips coming off and restricting the movement unfortunately has to go back the seller keeps contacting me offering money to remove the review 
positive,you get what you pay for hold true with this product being senior citizen on fixed income chose the cheapest option its better than nothing so ll continue to use it 
positive,great sound quality and durable
positive,if it werent for the battery life and ability to charge other devices would give this bass response and loudness is ok definitely not bad its better indoors than outdoors waterproofness is exceptional spilled cup of starbucks on it and it was unfazed hahaha its lil chunky if ya got big hands its not problem to carry around but it is hefty in weight just wished it had sound 
neutral,i had this mouse for two weeks and then it just stopped working which is so sad because it so cute
neutral,battery finally died for the first time after about weeks sets the bar pretty high resistance is perfect and not loudkeys are bright enough to be cool and visible but not blinding in the dark charges relatively fast and you can use it while charging first delivery didn show up but amazon worked it out with me 
positive,loved this mouse but literally bought it in october and today march th it broke super sad was hoping it will last longer
positive,my son uses it at school he is years old when asked him this he said it good better than my other one that it
neutral,good for the price it also doesn make the typical mouse clicking sound you can barely hear it 
neutral,battery stopped accepting charge after months of use submitted warranty request to jbl will see 
positive,i love this speaker took it to california and it is so easy and light to travel with the sound quality is amazing not only that but the battery life is soo good didn charge it the whole trip and used it for few hours each day have never had any problems with it so far but would highly recommend 
positive,works great
positive,likes works good for the price and is pretty good for membrane keyboard the battery seems to last quite long time didn actually time it the keyboard goes to sleep pretty fast to conserve battery life also can be con cons this is why it is cheap so the cons are to be expected for keyboard at this price point the keyboard flexes the rgb is very limited would of liked an option for solid color the keyboard shuts off even when plugged in probably the biggest downside the space bar is clacky and doesn feel as solid as the other keys if you want decent keyboard that is fairly cheap and works as advertised this isn bad buy 
neutral,this product only lights up in red not multi colored as described or shown other than that that it okay 
positive,surprised additions the headsets came with pc headset splitter in the box bought this for my son he loves it this fit properly and are very comfortable sound quality is too good for the price 
neutral,sounds good battery doesn last as long as advvertised 
negative, big design problems the lights don stay on probably to conserve the battery this means if you are not using the keyboard for few seconds say you are just using the mouse or just reading the screen the keys go dark then you can see whatever key you need to hit first when you are ready the enter key is one key farther to the right than standard keyboard as life long touch typist now am tying when mean to hit enter so not only did not gain the ability to see the keys in the dark but lost the expected location of the enter key just couple of points of clarification you cannot change the colors you can just adjust the brightness of the backlighting and you can put it on some weird breath setting where it slowly goes brigher and darker this does not take batteries like most wireless keyboards it actually requires wire to charge the built in battery which is billed as taking hours to charge for hours of usage might as well leave it connected so much for wireless 
positive,my grandson loves it 
neutral,was really clear
positive,update not sure why but this mouse is working better than it did when originally purchased it back in october use it every day and don mind charging it over night every couple of days or so it is comfortable to use and kind of funky in good way to use the changing lights feature from time to time naturally this will make the battery run down faster but once in while enjoy the light show lol and love how the click is so quiet they say they ve upgraded this product so hope you ll give it try too original review october my use of this mouse consists of following hours of use without the pretty little alternating lights on and then it switched off for the night before my next hours are over this thing runs out of life and must be charged again not at all thrilled with it it does have nice quiet click but if have to charge it every time use it don think it will last very long 
neutral,item broke already the wheel in the middle does not work did not last months
positive,i love this mouse ve had others before but never like this it was so easy to connect just plug in the usb connector and thats it no drivers to install or to download works right out the box its so natural when using this mouse even used it when was in the coach and it worked perfectly on the arm rest would recommend this all day good product 
positive,i like the fact that it turns off after some time like that it works with usb and like that can use it with my mac or my pc and like the charging cable 
positive,very good quality and comfortable
positive,it came in great shape and sound quality is better than my old set 
neutral,the box came absolutely smashed and the mouse doesn work with the usb adapter that included with it 
neutral,i ve had this wireless mouse less than month and the wheel of the mouse has already broke not to happy with this mouse won buy this again
neutral,this product is very nice 
positive,my son really likes tham good sound and microphone works well 
positive,pretty cool mouse honestly was only looking for simple mouse to use with my laptop the tracking works great and the colors are pretty cool nothing like adding little color to your workstation being able to recharge the mouse is plus 
positive,my son loves his gaming mouse
positive,i originally heard this thing at christmas someone else got one as gift listening to them test it out it put out some amazing sound from such small device it does sound great but there are technical glitches that are really irritating the first second of sound cuts out until it wakes up from its bluetooth soft sleep like state guessing it to save battery life it supposed to have an app to tailor all kinds of controls but after installing it it refused to recognize the speaker no matter what did it paired fine can play music to it from my phone but communication with the app nope little bit of user oriented testing would ve gone long way here 
positive,we are really enjoying our jbl charge speaker we use it all the time especially in the golf cart and hot tub it stays charged for long time and is easy to bluetooth to my phone we are very glad that we bought it 
positive,works good for the price little tight on the ears after wearing for few hours seems like they ll take bit of breaking them in to get comfortable 
neutral,liked this little mouse it holds charge but after months it no longer works even after fully charging the right mouse button will work so know it is connected uninstalled the device rebooted the laptop and nothing fixed the issue 
positive,my son loves playing his music and the sound is great he loves the speaker and takes it almost everywhere 
positive,noise canceling is great 
negative,noiseless very light and comfortable mouse but there was card in the same box saying if you will write review we will return the money spent on the mouse that not true spent time going through this process for nothing do not believe them was disappointed 
positive,this mouse saves ton in cost of batteries because it is rechargeable it fits the palm of my hand very comfortably well worth the cost 
positive,best portable speaker by far enclosed areas are key for the bass to hit just right 
positive,just bought near end of july already having issues battery drains extremely fast pointer has tracking issues won click most of the time have to repeatedly click on something for it to work 
neutral,usb part broke inside of computer hardly used 
neutral,good for gaming tv or music
positive,had issue with keyboard purchased for my granddaughter klim customer service reps went totally out of their way to fix the problem above and beyond can tell you for fact that if you need any help klim customer service won jerk you around totally impressed will definitely purchase from them again 
neutral,nice
positive,comfortable soft keys great responsiveness and retraction 
negative,had this for month and it already dead doesn charge and tried multiple usb cables would highly not recommend this or any no name products they are similar
positive,i loved the cushioning very comfy on my ears
neutral,i got these delivered the same day purchased them straight out of the box and mean straight out of the box the headphones on work on the left side the right side had no sound and the microphone doesn work do not waste your money garbage would leave no stars if applicable
positive,great value for the money super fast shipping arrived in less than hrs works as expected highly recommend
negative,i bought this mouse twice because wasn able to return them in time due to mailing issues thought the first one must be an error since it broke after hours of use guess how long the second mouse lasted hours absolute crap product and wasted my money
neutral,like other reviews stated this mouse is super nice smooth and looks neat but lasted just over the day return window put it on charge for the th time since had received it and the blue light comes on indicating it is charging and goes off some time later indicating it is complete when you switch it on the red light flashes and then goes off highly disappointing 
positive,i enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up but that is essentially it the battery storage on the mouse is super low so you ll have to plug it in any way after about half hour of use maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow led light feature the mouse scroll wheel broke on me in middle of game not any aggressive game mind you just house decorating sim and ve hardly used it for the six or so months ve had it to sum up for quick cheap purchase it looks great but isn worth it in the long run and regret not buying different mouse 
positive,very nice mouse love the size and feel
neutral,very good
positive,i bought this for the home shop and it makes really nice sound love it so far 
positive,works great no issues with my unit power button feels bit flimsy saw other reviewers complaining about it breaking and could see that happening am careful with mine and don use it frequently can change the color away from rainbow but you can alter the effect slightly didn get this for robust color features so this doesn bother me the keys are bit less diverted and less resistant then what used to frequently hit multiple keys while attempting to push one might bother another with sloppy hands like mine but look at it like challenge now that all being said this is hands down great option for wireless gaming there are slightly cheaper keyboards that tout these specs but they seem to be either too cheaply made or have to many reported issues for me to expect quality product on this note this keyboard is rechargeable there are other cheaper brands with similar products but they are mostly battery operated other issues in fact bought keyboard here on amazon that was similar no lights and used batteries it didn work upon arrival this was my second purchase got this for gaming wirelessly and use it with additonal ghz receivers no issues haven noticed any input delay but sit pretty close to the receiver so distance isn something have stress tested currently this is the keyboard would recommend for wireless gaming under 
positive,it great speaker would recommend
neutral,this was originally star review and wasn very happy with these headphones but after working with customer service they really worked to make this right overall 
positive,these are good for the money my year old likes them for gaming and listening to music 
neutral,very cheap quality but good for an emergency purchase shipping was very quick
positive,son uses for gaming and watching school videos and listening to audio books says they are very comfortable don hurt his ears sound quality is great dual plugs adapters means he can use them with laptop or his mp player can beat the quality for the price 
positive,i really enjoying this headset am saddened by the fact that for one of the headsets the mic doesn work yes we ve tried all the troubleshooting options but they re are working very well for me for my ps gaming purposes literally the only comment have is more of minor annoyance don care for the distance of the split for the jack and the usb while playing with controller the usb is useless but it can get in the way at times even when wrap it up with the velcro strap it comes with it be nice if could slide the plastic point where it splits to give myself more slack since can use the usb anyways but it really not that hard to move past just annoying overall very happy with my purchase 
positive,i thought it was fantastic at first wirked great for me at work now the wheel keeps popping out of place and doesnt work 
neutral,i bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design after using it for awhile plugged it in charged it worked for awhile then it would only work for few hours then not at all when plugged it in noticed that had to move the connection where it plugs into the device to the left then it would light up but if let go nothing would not recommend this product 
neutral,when hit the key it types io when hit the key it types io should have gone with logitech 
neutral,because can purchase an expensive one purchase the jbl charger don regret it love everything about it 
positive,it super quiet have it plugged in through hub adapter to google slate tablet and it worked immediately no issues at all lights up and color changes which is just cool add on feature no complaints here very portable

positive,love my jbl blue tooth speaker use it in my jet ski 
neutral,sometimes the keys work when click sometimes they don it get really annoying 
positive,i bought the charge year after got the charge loved the thumpin bass on the charge and decided to pair it with another jbl product and decided to go with the upgrade so got the charge set it up to the right and left of my work area the whole set up sounded awesome with sound coming from both left and right speaker sources as awesome as it was though it was not stereo just two identical sounds coming from different sources can hear the sound engineer instrumental separations during the recording as with headphones but like said produced some pretty good results for the price 
neutral,very satisfied with this mouse 
positive,the boys love these headsets
positive,great sound super portable and lasts long time 
neutral,use for work in an aqua aerobics class environment works quite well
neutral,i used the first pair for years and this is my second pair use these for work days week for hours per day and take them off and put them on at least times per shift so for the price point they ve done me quite well 
neutral,broke within week
positive,the charging cord was very flimsy and won charge any more lasted about week 
neutral,i purchased this for daily use although the design and colors were neat ended up breaking this is not durable mouse not usb another downfall is the light in the mouse could be blinding at times the mouse dropped once and broke

neutral,looked nice while it lasted but it wouldn charge after two months of light use 
neutral,this is not bluetooth product even though it shows up in results as bluetooth 
positive,this mouse is true to its description in that it silent and ergonomic but it wasn worth the money for me bought it in april and had to throw it out in january around november of started experiencing issues with charging where have to wriggle the cord around before it would start charging by january it was clear that there was an issue not with the charging cable but with the charging port in the mouse it was loose and wiggly when held the mouse up and it would only charge if held the mouse in my hand and kept the charger pressed in tightly recommend looking elsewhere for cute mouse 
neutral,inexpensive and good quality
neutral,i liked the mouse until the usb to usb dongle broke it is way to long on moving laptop
neutral,white button spin wheel broke months later too late to return 
positive,sweet sleek mouse with nice color can wait till its nighttime to show it off
neutral,don order it it does not function well at all 
neutral,very bulky and the sound quality for what you get is not worth the price returned mine for the flip which has little less bass but ultimately it is relatively close to the same sound for less
positive,really great headphones use them to play on nintendo and they work just perfect would definitely recommend
negative,this mouse is so sensitive if the surface is not absolutely debris free or flat signal signal won be sent from the wireless mouse to the computer screen ve had it for several weeks and have tried it with several mouse pads surfaces paper under the mouse it just not good fit like the changing light color it very pretty but for me not great wireless mouse 
positive,after bough this speaker another friend was so impressed that he bought one too it produces great sound quality can take it in any environment beach and it has plenty volume to fill the air with nice full sound 
neutral,very slim stays charged for long time
neutral,sound quality is as advertised battery life is exceptional feel good about this purchase 
positive, update after yr of usage used the keyboard almost everyday for whole year mostly for work rather than gaming and it is still like new then one day had to switch out my laptop at work and forgot to take the usb receiver before turning it in unfortunately couldn retrieve it and was beating myself up for it going back to using the laptop keys was highly excruciating so decided to take chance and ask if the usb receiver was replaceable their customer service is phenomenal the same rep communicated with me throughout the process have you ever played hot potato with customer service then you know how amazing this feels and she always responded pretty quickly to my emails there was never lag time the only hiccup ran into was at the very beginning when searched for customer service portal through amazon the initial link connected me with the klim technical riding gear rather than klim technologies however they gave me the correct email address immediately and it was smooth sailing from there they told me the usb receiver is replaceable yayyyy but that part was on backorder was more happy to know be able to continue using the keyboard so was willing to wait month later they provided an update that the part was still on backorder but that they were going to send me new one it arrived as promised and can go back to typing comfortably and with lightening speed just got it and have only used it for couple of hours but thoroughly impressed by this keyboard smooth buttons smooth typing comfortable feel and full sized buttons and now have number key pad the presentation was also impressive black little envelope with seemingly personalized note with little flare from the makers when you open the box love it just the quality of the keys make it obvious that it will be great for game play the keys feel so light and smooth under my fingers as type hope it lasts forever 
positive,i like it good it shine keyboard functions reliably and has long battery life like that it auto sleeps to save on battery it especially beautiful too there is some latency but it not noticeable when playing games like the sims or planet zoo 
neutral,i wasn looking for an ultra gamer keyboard with the lowest latency and most responsiveness highest keystrokes per minute possible was just looking for something could see in low lighting at night and take with me to the couch to control the tv monitor with this did the job perfectly battery seems to last about hours on my count with the setting of full lighting every keystroke would recommend 
positive,this is fun mouse love the gold and the light show it provides most importantly it works so well and makes me work at light speed 
neutral,very cheap quality the lights don look like the photo it just changes from one color to another and never looks rainbow like in the photos also buttons are not silent 
neutral,like outside
positive,nice mouse responds well works great with my windows laptop battery life is fair haven had it long so far it been good will update
positive,sound is amazing love it
positive,the wireless mouse worked well in the begining it was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were nice though not necessary feature received it in september it wasnt something used every day about once or twice week in february the scroll wheel just broke it spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen do not use it often and am definitely not rough on it am dissapointed in the quality of this product 
neutral,this headset works alright for being made of cheap feeling and looking plastic it does the job but the sound quality is not good and there practically no noise cancellation it also only lights up when its plugged in highly suggest saving your money and getting better quality headset 
positive,sounds great looks great portable and with nice design easy to use would recommend to others 
neutral,he has been using them about week and we have no complaints if something changes we will add it to our review 
neutral,cable length isnt bad and audio is decent dont recommend it for the microphone since have to essentially put it in my mouth for it to work but solid pair of headphones for the price
neutral,it worked fine until it quit one day can really complain because of the price but going to to try something else to replace it 
positive,my jbl speaker didn receive the charging cord or the carrying case that was suppose to come with it could and would you please send those two these to me thank you 
neutral,went through batterys like crazy and did not last long was disapointedit in it
positive,make sure you keep an eye on kiddos with these headphones overall they are great in sound and support
neutral,i like that it is lightweight and very durable and it is quiet can use it at night or early morning and not make sound 
positive,the key doesn work pretty hard to do anything when pretty important letter is not able to be used 
positive,overall really like them they re fairly solid product comfortable to wear sound quality it good they feel sturdy and easy to operate the only complaint have is that the cord is little bulky and cumbersome but even with that actually kind of glad that its sturdy and feels durable 
positive,i bought this mouse on august it worked well for while but today september the mousewheel spins freely while my screen does not scroll you get what you pay for and guess with this you re only paying for mouse for month and half 
negative,i bought it on june nd it august th and the microphone stopped working the return date was july rd have been trying to contact the seller and no success 
neutral,the coolest mouse ever it charges quickly and lasts long time love the color changes and the smoothness it scrolls with 
neutral,don buy this you have to charge it every day you might as well have mouse with cord because that what it ends up being it does not take battery and hass to be charged all the time 
neutral,broke after weeks of having it 
positive,it great mouse perfect and just what was looking for it really quiet which appreciate because louds clicks do get annoying after some time but not with this mouse the lights are cool too really slim so it easy to pack in my work bag and it feels great while using it 
positive,ordered for my daughter for her xbox to play and she loves it great buy 
neutral,it takes too long to wake up and the battery dies quickly the instructions were terrible have no idea what the two on settings are for as they are not addressed at all seems to do what basic mouse is supposed to do but would look elsewhere for higher quality next time 
neutral,worked good
neutral,i loved this mouse used it for few hours of office work once every week or two so very light use in the scheme of things for computer mouse received it end of june and it is currently middle of december so about months until the roller scroller part of the mouse broke 
neutral,this thing is nuts the sound looks material everything was so worth it 
neutral,it is normal that it only charge hrs 
neutral,actually changed my mind on this mouse the one was using was driving me crazy because the clicking was so loud broke this one out of the box and it pretty cool it changes colors and it silent can work with the size being slimer 
positive,very comfortable to wear and it was great deal for starter headset it had everything needed and wanted
positive,super quiet you just don hear any clicks love that it is rechargeable instead of replacing batteries have had it for weeks and have only charged it twice 
positive,we have two of these now and we love them 
positive,great product
neutral,the mouse no matter how much charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money spent on this all wanted was mouse to help me work on my macbook and this was just huge disappointment 
positive,i like the quality of the sound is is amazing have not tested the water proof ability of the speaker yet but am sure it is workink the battery could be improved 
positive,so needed good quality wireless keyboard but was little unsure any would meet my standards as techie and have huge tv and distance to my couch where was going to play pc games from just wow this thing has the responsiveness of wired gaming keyboard feels great to handle and use it at nearly feet away to boot it actually better than some of my professional keyboards use at nearly the cost totally worth the buy and the battery lasts ridiculously long 
neutral,my mouse is not working properly just purchased it not even week ago sending it back
positive,love it
neutral,broken out of the box 
negative,i bought this headset for my grandson july th and the microphone stopped functioning august st he only used the headset six times ridiculous 
positive,sounds amazing just not the color ordered only gave stars because didn get the color ordered really wanted the blue one 
positive,this was bit bigger than was anticipating but not complaining while that does affect portability slightly it still very easily transported especially with the case sold separately but worthwhile investment it loud and sounds great and the battery life is amazing there bigger better model for little more money but for my needs this works fantastic had some trouble with using it while camping as it seemed to only be picking up mono you could hear the background music and noises like doors slamming and whatnot but not the dialogue not sure if the problem was with the speaker the transmitter or the tv it was hooked up to hooking up bluetooth headphones the sound was perfect and hooking up this speaker to different devices the sound has also been perfect so don know where the breakdown was 
positive,we have this speaker in blue great speaker gift recipient wanted yellow not even close gold at best maybe basketball orange didn go through the hassle of returning 
positive,very happy with the sound quality and volume levels love that can charge my phone with this speaker 
neutral,quality was not worth it stopped working unexpectedly
neutral,i don like the sleep mode if that what it is that makes me have to press the button every time want to use it again rather it just stay on also it has to be recharged every days and not big computer user so that pain because have to change the cord and usb every time 
positive,gaming on the switch works great 
positive,i purchased this speaker because it if the name and thought they made great sounding speakers that is not the case with this speaker guess should spend more money to get the quality of sound want 
positive,it amazing
positive,this mouse has become my new best friend have arthritis which has severely affected my hands its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage the mouse is absolutely quiet as promised plus is easily used without huge amount of pressure from my fingers hand or wrist the mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations my hands are grateful and so am another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsonce charged the battery is good for quite few days do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily and sometimes more have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for eight days actually it was still working but had become bit slow to react rather than wait for it to quit completely charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week am very glad chose to try this mouse my next purchase of mouse if or when needed will be repeat of this one in different color this is an unpaid and unsolicited review from grateful owner 
negative,a solid keyboard for the price the battery life is not very good and if you use your computer lot it sort of defeats the purpose of it being wireless the keys are not silent although they are more quiet than most standard keyboards the backlighting provides nice visual but contributes to the poor battery life on single charge however the light level makes the keys very visible in dark or dimly lit room if the rgbs are important to you consider keyboard with more programmability because this one can only switch between off on and glow with options to toggle light level and glow frequency 
positive,bought it for my wife as present and she wanted and loves it
neutral,cheap
neutral,in less than months after purchasing the scrolling wheel stopped working 
neutral,i like because the battery long life more than hrs
neutral,precise led optional lightweight mouse has slot for bluetooth and is rechargeable no more batteries stellar with the precision mouse pad
positive,i have two jbl charge had for year or more wanted to add more speakers as can hook up to jbl speakers the best feature you can have for portable bluetooth speakers well the newer charge speakers bought just now cannot communicate with the connect firmware software of my charge showstopper for me guess could go back and get some charge of just look around for others if missed the asterisk that said the and don work together am sorry for this review 
positive,keyboard is cute but ve rubbed the letters off after just two months of use and some of the keys don work like they should like ctrl arrow to move over whole word it works to the right but not to the left going to have to replace it soon 
positive,i was looking for wireless rechargeable mouse because recently lost my old mouse but kind of glad did because really love this one it super cute sleek and the lights are so pretty the clicks are quiet like it says in the description and easy to use would recommend this to anyone looking for mouse 
positive,i wish would have gotten one earlier love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier
positive,works well special features are fun
positive,this is still stars because description is correct and perfect for price nothing else will beat it best for laptop pc gaming but bought it for ps console so the lighting feature won work because the usb cable is not long enough to reach the console while also having the auxiliary plugged into your ps remote what you can do is have phone charging battery pack with you to have it power up the led lights lol that what did
positive,this speaker has incredible sounds great value 
positive,great
positive,excellent
positive,battery takes forever to die which is great sleep mode helps lot it thinner and smoother than any other mouse ve own love the lights

neutral,you get what you pay for works some days and doesn on others 
positive,this speaker seems very sturdy and durable don plan to use it around water so won comment on how well it works when wet the sound is amazing for such small device very rich tone and lots of bass overall very satisfied 
positive,y all now know that haven had this keyboard long at all weeks but it is game changer the sound of the keys isn too loud but it not so soft that you feel unproductive love the way that the keys actually feel when am typing the color of the keyboard is great too would purchase this keyboard at full price all over again if had to primeday

neutral,you can beat it for the price
neutral,stopped working cant return either 
positive,these and the other chinese brand that are exactly the same are pretty good for the price have owned andnthisnis my th pair like anything else the cable does eventually good bad at the plug end however every set has lasted me over year think the shortest time frame was about year and half and that is using them basically every day for hours on end sound is not broadcast quality by any means but it not terrible either have never had any complaints from anyone saying they sound bad or hard to understand or hear 
neutral,the battery life is pretty bad
positive,i bought this for my year old he goes through headsets like crazy this one was incredibly affordable hopefully it will last great customer support from the company so far

neutral,there si not the product that bougth is not jbl is megablast and cant use for my other jbl speakers 
positive,for it pretty good
neutral,it works nicely 
positive,i really liked this mouse being able to charge it and not worry about batteries was working great up till today tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out the cover to it was still stuck inside the port had to use tools to get it out and now it no longer usable very upset have lot of work have to get done and using mouse makes it smoother to navigate guess this would happen just after weeks of the return window closing have only had this since the end of july 
negative,so my review after using this mouse for months there are lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another the mouse stops working in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged you have to turn off the mouse put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again will not recommend this mouse to anyone couple days later the mouse has completely stopped working and there no customer service response update the mouse is still not working have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company but they don respond the quality of customer service update it been over months since got the replacement even the replacement is horrible it stops responding the action time is delayed when you left click it doesn respond this is even after carefully keep the mouse 
positive,it works very well got it as gift for my boyfriend and he loves it
neutral,these speakers worked well for couple of months play lot of music so had to charge them have at least once week last week one of them would not power down no matter what troubleshooting did today the nd one wouldn power up no matter what did after doing some research apparently the power button is an ongoing flaw with this product my speakers are still under warranty so am going through the process of having them evaluated and hopefully replaced however being my first experience with jbl speakers which thought would be bulletproof sadly disappointed 
positive,easy on the hand looks great recharge easy 
positive,it great head set good sound easy to use did receive funny but weird bonus used acrylic nail tip so some one out there is missing piece of their manicure picture included 
positive,this is great wireless mouse at great price it comes with usb charger and quickly connected to my laptop it feels great on my palm and the cursor moves around the screen smoothly love the ability to change the mouse lighting and love how lightweight but durable it is 
negative, not so great with the rendering dragging objects with the mouse is not so great especially acrosss screens work on visio lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around so basically has bad sensor but its smooth and very quiet 
positive,this awesome jbl speaker and great sound
neutral,this mouse is unusable for someone who wishes to work efficiently it tracks completely erratically and is simply not worth using 
neutral,the first one had defective charging cord connector very loose and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally both were returned under warranty and won be reordered again neat but not good quality 
positive,not great they don really fit snug on your ears no noise cancelation not very loud for gaming mic works good light is cool probably good for kids thought it was good deal on decent set but really they are just headset ill be returning them as they were not what was expecting or hoping for and don fit 
neutral,this mouse worked perfectly for about months almost on the month mark exactly the scroll wheel stopped working it just spins and doesn move the cursor up and down the page looked to see if could return but the window closed month ago don be tempted by the cheap price should have stuck to name brand 
neutral,it good headset for the price paid 
positive,when first bought it felt bit skeptical about the product but when tried it out was definitely amazed with how much of difference it made in the sound quality of my games and honestly fell like this would be my go to product if ever so find myself needing new pair of headphones 
neutral,long lasting battery good sound quality always connects to bluetooth 
positive,i got these for my boyfriend birthday he loves them they for sure noise cancel because have to scream at him for him to hear me you would have to connect the light usb to power source if you re not gaming on computer but works great for his daily use 
positive,perfect size with enormous sound
positive,worth every dollar these earphones have great sound feel comfortable and are great as far as the price would definitely rerecommend them 
positive,i had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had lot of reviews it works great the mouse looks good and has sleek design the led lights are fun touch and the dpi feature is nice to have had zero issues connecting the mouse to my macbook wirelessly to with the usb port what did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use coming from mouse that had an arch in the design this mouse was little flatter than that another are the clicks and scrolls it definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling it not loud like compared to regular mice but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse did end up returning the mouse but would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design it still great mouse overall 
positive,the headset is pretty well built the only drawback is the extra long cord that connects to the controller 
positive,comfortable fit can be worn easily with glasses 
positive,the product is good and operates well 
neutral,mouse battery doesn charge
positive,is came with one side of the headset not working then when speaking into the mic the other party couldn hear what was being said recommend maybe different one if this worked for you great but on my end it didn the box came little beat up looking too also very light weight feel like they would have broke easily sent it back for refund 
neutral,they work really well with my xbox 
neutral,okay
positive,i bought this for my work laptop and just love it easy to use and love that it is rechargeable fantastic design so it not hard on your hands and connects easily with no issues 
positive,this mouse is good quality for low price love the multi colored led lights on the side and middle chose the blue and feel like it adds pop of color to my office however the blue paint is already peeling on the bottom and ve only used it little while not sure if it came like that or is already wearing there are probably other products for similar price that could be better quality 
positive,great value and very sturdy nice color and easy to use 
positive,excellent sound and reception 
positive,i bought this mouse to match the keyboard bought for my daughter to use with her laptop she does online school and likes having mouse as well as keyboard she likes that they match and both light up didn know how it would be for gaming 
positive,works great and looks cool great value for the money 
positive,worked great for about weeks and then the battery kept dying faster and faster now it cannot even hold charge so it now rests in the garbage can 
neutral,i just spent lot of money on this little thing and couple months later it won stay on go to return it but amazon account tells me it was only month warranty that pathetic if that true 
neutral,super unresponsive fun idea but would not recommend to anyone 
positive,well the color is great but it stopped working after two uses tryed to charge it and it doesn even take charge won try anything from this vendor again 
positive,this is great cordless mouse it is rechargeable as long as the computer is on there is place on the bottom to store the dongle if not in the computer if dropped it will come apart unfortunately it does fly in special education classroom stronger shell would be great also an extra dongle in case you lose the first one 
positive,ergonomics are great quality is okay very lite weight and made of cheap plastic mouse pointer seems jumpy at times for no reason all in all would probably spend little more money if you can or want to so that you get better quality device 
neutral,save your money used them times and they broke
positive,excellent mouse it really handy and helped me lot in my academic work am already big fan of it 
positive,bought in february and it worked great until rd or th charge now it not connecting to my computer any longer 
positive,i have used many different jbl speakers including the extreme and honestly these littler ones are way more worth buying then the big expensive newer ones love my charge 
neutral,smooth wakes with click and best of all no batteries holds charge all day with constant use
neutral,i really enjoyed this mouse at st due to my job but less than months of using it it has completely stopped working one of the girls work with owns similar mouse and when mine stopped working it actually worked with her laptop even though the mouse chip was plugged into my laptop 
neutral,cute
neutral,the wheel breaks easily
neutral,i ve had the speaker for about and half weeks and probably played hours of music on it went to turn it on today and noticed the music was grainy sounding and lacked bass at first thought maybe could be wrong that it didn sound as good as thought went and checked others reviews and charge issues and many people are experiencing this issue the jbl website warns about buying from unauthorized dealers and stated that counterfeit speakers have the exact same issue experiencing however the jbl website lists amazon as an authorized dealer which is where got my charge so guess have an authentic speaker that now has turned into piece of trash after barely any use 
neutral,it already doesn work
positive,love the sound it the same size as the charge superb sound
positive,love it second purchased first one was so good it walked out of my house on its own lol
neutral,sound quality is amazing although the woofer is off centred and it loses the stage sound its predecessors had 
positive,the mouse feels amd looks great that the only positive aspect there is this thing cannot even connect to its own hardware so half the time you re just clicking happening this piece of garbage connects 
positive,a sweet ergonomic mouse with good responses 
positive,good headset for gaming love how the provide the splitter for audio in and audio out jacks on your pc so you don have to buy one for being way cheaper than the rest would say it great quality 
negative,usb device failed after months it was working great before that the device now is not recognized by my pc have tried every form of trouble shooting could find online without success 
neutral,ok all
neutral,had it for three months and it was working fine loved that the click was quiet and it was lightweight but it stopped charging and working out of nowhere 
positive,i got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it well day it wouldn charge so gave it break and decided to try charging it on my mac she had originally tried her school chrome book few seconds of it being plugged in it started smoking it smelled like burning plastic so quickly just unplugged and didn bother doing anything else with the mouse 
positive,this is good quiet keyboard bought it because my wife and share one living room which is also where write on my laptop keyboard noise was driving her nuts bought this wireless keyboard because it was advertised as quiet it really is quieter made it even less noisy by putting piece of towel under it that has really helped my marriage survive during the pandemic cooped up together the keyboard lighting is nice prefer lighted keyboard since sometimes wake up can sleep and start writing another chapter for book that may someday be bestseller the keyboard charged up easily with the short usb cord included the charge usually lasted one to two weeks between charging even when forgot to use the switch underneath to turn it off for the night when the battery died the keyboard was instantly usable again as soon as plugged it into the laptop have just one small grumble writer not gamer when typing fast want large enter button on this keyboard it is little smaller in order to make room for backslash key find myself getting lot of backslashes instead of new paragraphs this happened with different keyboard few years ago which threw away due to aggravation for this quiet keyboard however the configuration is not so aggravating for now its quietness is terrific other than the extra backslash key the keyboard action is nice feels great can write for hours when not interrupted by my dog hope this is helpful for someone be well 
neutral,waste of money
neutral,i work in fast paced setting being able to un dock and move needed something small to transport this fut my need actually bought two may buy more for my team 
positive,this mouse has been the best one that have ever used would purchase this again the fun part of the multi colors is another reason to purchase it again
positive,was bigger than my last speaker and louder to if you like to feel like you re at concert than buy this one 
positive,this mouse works well for my needs and fits in my medium sized hands well this is the first mouse ve ever owned with built in rechargeable battery and now don ever want to own one without it the small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go another nicely designed element is that the nano receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn require prying off cover or any extra effort to remove or insert 
neutral,this is regular keyboard light weight works ok not good for gaming it drops signal signal is intermittent and or keyboard light turns off quickly 
neutral,the charge has one speaker in the front left side the charge had two speakers and assumed the would keep this design the sound quality is fine but the build of the speaker is misleading 
neutral,i bought this mouse months ago use it constantly and have yet to charge it for the price point steal 
positive,love the color affects
neutral,backlite goes off to fast need it to stay on for few minutes
positive,great audio and good noise canceling
neutral,i was so excited when got my mouse in to go with my laptop and it didn even work had it charge over night while it was off and still wouldn connect 
positive,super cute but it is really slow 
neutral,came broken then forgot to return in time 
positive,these sound so good and they are at great price highly recommend
neutral,terrible product charge lasts only couple of hours 
negative,i had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just weeks would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen every task on the computer began to take the amount of time it used to had to resort to using the trackpad on my macbook which not fan of definitely don get this mouse not worth it 
negative,no power supply included disappointed children on christmas 
neutral,i like the shape and the way the mouse works unfortunately can even make it through whole day of work without it needing to be charged again 
neutral,this product didn wouldn charge
positive,the best headset you can buy for the money hands down 
neutral,this mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given as is typical of many amazon products this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future and strongly suggest not buying this mouse unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don work is past time of yours then knock yourself out 
positive,love my new speaker sound is great and easy to set up 
positive,my loved it sound quality is good and the microphone was working perfectly
positive,it cool feels pretty smooth and nice light colors but the battery doesn last long 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse first off have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works that is huge with me next it very nice mouse love the colors it lights up with its so nice to not have to worry about battery too just plug in and charge and ready to go swear charge it like once month too and it still works great highly recommend this mouse 
positive,received with everything shown even came charged and ready for use gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and it was great gift it can be used from far away for when your laptop is connected to the tv through the hdmi cord with no problem 
neutral,nice simple headset for gaming inexpensive with year warranty 
neutral,roller ball stopped working within months of minimal use piece of junk 
positive,super
positive,this headset is perfect for ps its also pretty good for xbox but dont like how you have to plug in the extra cord and its very short give it only for the short cord but other than that it is perfect comfortable and overall good looking also like how it was packaged so neat and safely 
neutral,had this mouse for month and the wheel already stopped working
positive,feels great sleek different colors for different laptops nice 
positive,works great just feels little flimsy so not sure how it will hold up suppose it good value for the price the slowly changing colored led lights are pretty cool like that unlike the apple magic mouse you can use this mouse while it is charging the seller extended the warranty another months after registered it so that gives me little more confidence in the quality or at least the customer service was compensated by the seller for this review with refund of the purchase price of the mouse 
neutral,as described
positive,i got this for my son so he could attend his school virtually and then he also uses it for playing computer games he ha not complained thing about it since we got it so would say am happy with the purchase no problem cheers 
positive,needed wifi mouse for my hp chromebook liked the fun lights and the price was good set up was quick and easy via bluetooth works great 
positive,great product 
positive,they work as intended but sometimes they re weird you do get what you pay for the cord is obnoxiously long the microphone only works if have the switch perfectly in between the muted and not muted setting very odd the headset covers your whole ear so it doesn put pressure on them which is nice the headset itself is pretty big and clunky though definitely good purchase if you re casual gamer who just needs cheap headset had it for couple years and it works 
positive,big fan of this mouse works great and used for strait days without needing charge 
positive,exactly what was looking for great quality and sound
positive,love the lights 
positive,it was great especially for the price
neutral,good sound and quality for reasonable price 
positive,the quality is amazing bought them for my fianc for our playstation he loves these headphones 
positive,it came as advertised my son was happy 
neutral,this mouse is junk the battery charge does not last it is rechargeable but you can use your computer while it is charging 
neutral,i have to say impressed not only does it light up but accidentally dropped it in dog bowl full of water and it still works can ask for more than that for the price 
neutral,worth of purchase 
neutral,really smooth soft click liked 
positive,great products and the prize is amazing
neutral,we wanted silent keys these are regular noisy keys returning since not as advertised 
neutral,it works
neutral,confortable to use silent clic and battery lasts lot
positive,love this speaker would definitely recommend buying this one 
negative,after two months of non regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it own and now feels somewhat loose when touched was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies 
positive,i really liked this mouse being able to charge it and not worry about batteries was working great up till today tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out the cover to it was still stuck inside the port had to use tools to get it out and now it no longer usable very upset have lot of work have to get done and using mouse makes it smoother to navigate guess this would happen just after weeks of the return window closing have only had this since the end of july 
neutral,no quality
positive,love the headset so far 
positive,clicking the right and left stick and it is slow to catch click cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for cute yes but not worth the frustration 
positive,ears are little tough compared to my cowin but it pretty comfortable the audio is also nice 
negative,bought this to get rid of wires on my desk and it has been great but the battery doesn last as long as expected and that with the backlights turned off was also disappointed to find that not all usb cables work to charge it lost the cable that comes with the keyboard to charge it and when it died only one of my usb cables would charge it and found that really strange not totally sure why that is but it something that noticed so if you don have lot of usb cables don lose the one that comes with it otherwise you might not be able to charge it otherwise like it haven had any problems other than what is mentioned 
positive,this mouse works as advertised the changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for new mouse on amazon don really like the slim feel to it feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time also was looking for specifically usb mouse and to make this one work with usb you have to use the included adapter which ends up sticking out quite ways on the edge of your computer this is clearly stated in the advertisement just didn pay enough attention when bought the mouse 
neutral,i love it when first got it but now it has stopped working 
positive,i don do much pc gaming at the moment so can speak for that but this is great buy very affordable small but great for my big long hands great response time long lasting battery charge and easy to see in the dark 
negative,less than months after receiving my keyboard it stopped working the on off switch on the back of the keyboard seems to have something to do with the problem the keyboard stopped working couple of weeks after the return window closed so was referred to klim directly long story short klim never resolved the issue despite the fact that this product has warranty sent about emails before giving up would definitely not recommend the product when purchased the keyboard was excited about the features described but if the product doesn function then those features are useless note didn have any problems with the amazon seller 
positive,bought these for my year old and he absolutely loves them they work well with his android phone and ps 
positive,i ve never had to charge it for the few weeks used it the lights cant change dont think but it doesnt matter to me the wireless range is good enough as well keys feel nice it sleeps when idle and find the wakeup very responsive havent had any issues with this havent really used the various function keys and never gamed with it use controller anyway but for what do it works perfectly 
neutral,worth it
neutral,i like the look and feel but the mechanic of using it are slime after week
positive,i love that it change colors it sleek and easy to control will most definitely order another one 
negative,i bought one for my grandson and he seemed to like it for gaming we had to return the first one for the same reason so that was two his second one is still working so we decided it must have been an isolated incident wanted the colored backlighting as well and it was still rated higher than most so purchased one for myself bad idea this morning it worked when signed in to my computer and then stopped working in the middle of meeting do not trust this product cannot even return the most recent one and do not understand why out of bucks 
positive,i honestly don dislike anything it holds charge for couple of weeks and also love that it slim also love how it changes colors nice little gadget highly recommend 
neutral,for one this mouse is not compatible with the adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device update it and see why the adapter isn working or remove this item 
positive,such great headsets my boyfriend loved them 
neutral,not as good as the charge 
positive,these are pretty good if you aren looking for long term they work great but mine only lasted few months before just completely giving out randomly
neutral,it would ve been nice if this actually worked 
positive,i was looking for mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one am pleasantly surprised by this mouse the click is very quiet yet there is satisfying tactile feel to it though the right click can be bit sensitive but nothing too major think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable very convenient the mouse can be used while charging and only took about hours to fully charge there is led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging the mouse will also go into sleep mode after minutes of inactivity to save power overall great mouse 
neutral,great product but little too flat for me 
positive,my grandson loves that it glows in the dark the only thing that he don like is that the usb cord is too short 
positive,love the mouse my only downfall is that it very light and used to little heavier one so it something to get used too 
negative,not the best headphones ve purchased doesn provide the same quality for headphones less the price 
positive,my son loves this speaker they use it at practice every day 
positive,i always loved jbl products they have amazing sound quality for their price point when ordered it was nervous cause always like to test speakers out in store before ordering it but could this time it was gift for my partner and was definitely not disappointed the speaker isn to big and it definitely sounds amazing definitely recommend 
positive,really like this mouse never thought say that it stores the usb port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces it quiet click which appreciate even when working alone and the rainbow lighting is optional win win win it light too as it rechargeable carry it with my laptop and it made working on the go better
neutral,when some essential combination of key press it does not work this keyboard is useless
positive,it works excellent it is very awesome

neutral,i can get through the morning without this mouse losing its charge would rather battery 
positive,this mouse is true to its description in that it silent and ergonomic but it wasn worth the money for me bought it in april and had to throw it out in january around november of started experiencing issues with charging where have to wriggle the cord around before it would start charging by january it was clear that there was an issue not with the charging cable but with the charging port in the mouse it was loose and wiggly when held the mouse up and it would only charge if held the mouse in my hand and kept the charger pressed in tightly recommend looking elsewhere for cute mouse 
neutral,this product stop working after month
neutral,as the title states this headset worked at first after about two three months the sound became quieter four months later no longer have sound on the left side oh well not bad for about 
neutral,works as described 
positive,i would not recommend this product at all it cheap for reason it rarely works while it looks nice its performance is very poor in each box they ll include little flier saying you ve won free product to receive it you need to leave good review while they do indeed follow through and give you the product it harmless scam to get positive reviews for their bad products spend the money on better product 
positive,just the right size nice and clear and the volume is perfect get two and they connect to each other very very nice kick ass sound
positive,great sound 
negative,i ve bought of these mouses when the first one broke thought it might just have been dud really liked the mouse up until that point so decided to get another one it been weeks and the same issues with both mouses the scroll button broke while the mouse does still technically work it super inconvenient and annoying 
positive,i just got the mouse today and so far so good it didn take long to fully charge it sleek lightweight love the different colors that it alternates one of the best things is that the clicking sound of the mouse is not even noticeable it super quiet

neutral,not as good as the charge have can get my two to sync the is not as loud as the 
positive,i did not dislike anything it was amazing the sound quality was great and my kid loves it 
neutral,only complaint is usb cord was too short to plug into my computer for the lights on the headphone my laptop had an outlet on the left side and attached cord would not reach 
positive,i love the colors that it shuffles through also like that it is virtually sound proof no more hearing click from across the room only thing wish could pick stationary color instead of that feature always being red 
neutral,the headset is really nice but the cord is like feet so its constantly getting stuck or tangled
positive,got this for my son for christmas he was always borrowing my charge the charge sounds great and the camo color looks even better in person the battery life on these is excellent 
positive,if were younger person or one with perfect eye sight this keyboard could have been perfect additionto my computer equipment but as an older guy with glaucoma in my vision find that this keyboardis not very comfortable for me to use the most disheartening problem is that the keyboard illuminationgets turned off after seconds even though it is always plugged in into usb power source mostlywork in completely darkened bedroom so as not to disturb my sleeping partner and it is annoyingtrying to locate turned off keyboard in the dark also find that the lights do not clearly illuminate the keys also am not touch typist shame on me and so seeing the keys quite clearly is important to me it is also hard for me to make out the inscriptions on doubly labeled keys because the inscriptions aretiny to my liking am really very sorry for such negative review of your product like said in thebeginning had been young or had perfect vision this review could have been different please forgive me 
positive,absolutely love everything about this speaker the battery life is insanely long if you re debating between this speaker and another one get this one you won be disappointed

positive,i always wanted mouse which is similar to the apple one and found this to use for my windows laptop its very stylish rgb light looks pretty cool like the sleep feature it goes to sleep pretty quickly saving the battery and also that the mouse is rechargeable 
neutral,good headset
positive,just got this last night for my new acer when plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around with usb or usb plug it zig zags across the screen when trying to move in straight line it stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it overnight and same results this morning adjusted the dpi with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen tried troubleshooting but can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works 
positive,works really good when you playing call of duty or division to love this item this is the second pair ve bought one for me and one for my friend
positive,had few issues but customer service was awesome problem was resolved immediately overall would buy headset again 
positive, sound battery life build quality led too bright don time out they have daisy chain feature you can use but it been hit miss with us these speakers are fantastic for the price we bought of the charge and charge the only reason these aren star for us is that the primary use is in the bedroom to play sleep stories music the leds for buttons on top never time out while the speaker is turned on and are sooo bright in dark room unfortunately we have to drape something over the top of the speaker to hide the lights stars if that weren an issue as for battery life use one in my office all week for conference calls with desk mic and charge it only every other week fantastic 
positive,i like the the ease of use don go through batteries because it chargeable the light is not over bearing the lights don disturb sleeping loved ones the ergonomic design is easy on the hands overall it nice and easy product to use 
neutral,they worked well for while lately have been causing feedback to the mic which ofc makes them unusable not really sure what might have caused this issue all of sudden whether it zoom meetings or gaming being told that when speak there is an feedback loop upgrading to something better guess 
positive,love how amazon is fast and product is great
neutral,the scrolling feature stopped by april the mouse will not scroll page using the scroll button on top of the mouse not good

positive,still cant figure out the connect feature but super great speaker on its own the power bank is sick 
neutral,this is great mouse if only my cat would stop breaking them 
positive,iupdated returned and bought another as really liked the way it fit my hand etc the first one didn get charged til it was out and then wouldn recharge after it died ve plugged this one to charge more frequently and am happy to keep it not going to let it die cuz don want to suffer finding out it design flaw on the other hand could have just been the one first bought am so disappointed received my pretty mouse charged it and love it fits my small hands no clicking sounds easy to use received it around july today is july and the cursor won work hadn charged it so plugged it in to charge the wheel still works but the clicker won work when press it nothing happens would exchange it for new one but then don have many days left to see if it works and really don want to take chance on losing my money these mice seem to work great for some and don work for some may figure out which credit card gives year warranty beyond the normal one which is non existent at least could try again 
positive,very nice keyboard lots of color choices breathing speed can be adjusted from really slow to fast or you can choose to not breathe at all and keep solid color well made my only complaint is it shuts off after seconds of non use but simple touch of button immediately turns it back on again contacted customer service for some questions regarding the lighting nothing was wrong with the keyboard customer service was fantastic they responded to me immediately and answered all my questions would definitely recommend this keyboard

positive,great product and for one with an injured wrist this makes everything so much easier make sure you charge this keyboard first and then put it to good use did this and it has been some time now and still running smooth love it connectivity the works and the colors are all just awesome
positive,this is the third bengoo headset purchased for the cheap cost of this headset the quality is far superior to the price highly recommend this headset and company to anyone in need of quality headset without the quality price 
positive,it is great compact size nice features feels good in the hand like that it is rechargeable 
negative,i have been using for about weeks and it died it will not charge 
positive,i bought two of these to use with our laptops both computers recognized them right away and we were able to use them easily like the variety of colors offered and the lower profile so my hand doesn cramp like it has with some other styles the light up colors are fun think it was good value for the money 
negative,never lit up my autistic son wanted these so bad for that reason and of course they didn work 
positive,not really ergonomic but don have an underlying issue where this is problem for me love the color changing aspect conversation piece and the charge lasts couple of days also turn it off when leave so really don know how long it really lasts but have not had any issues its mouse if you want it get it if you don don 
neutral,within month the scroller stopped working 
positive,this model is more so for bass if you love bass this speaker is perfect for you in every way however the quality of the actual sound could be improved it exactly like the reviews on youtube videos and the company videos explained with all of that said it worth the money and is loud if you are in middle school sized gym and it playing on apple music volume turned up completely it heard just saying it loud loud for house outside activities especially apartment bluetooth connects with no problem battery life last as promised for hours with non stop playing 
neutral,ear muffs feel cheap and after an hour it just feels weird on you head solid pass
negative,i really liked using this mouse it died hair quicker than like but would just use it wired while it charged up however month after using it the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn come back up making it impossible for me to use as use that often in playing sims didn expect much as didn pay much but was slightly disappointed 
positive,i bought it for work it so smooth color is matte black led lights are so cool and fun doesn make any clicking sound is rechargeable very happy with this purchase 
positive,this mouse was purchased for year old girl she loves the colors the fit and the fact that it works without making noise 
positive,this is loud louder than vtin or louder than aomais life bass is good miss and highs kind of muffled some distortion when over volume but very good speaker overpriced some but good speaker 
neutral,as soon as took this out of the box knew that was probably going to be sending it back it looks nice in the picture but it is piece of cheap plastic it felt so cheap that just couldn even use it sent it right back 
positive,i love how sleek it is and that its very responsive stylish and comfortable in my hand if my wife takes this one like she does most of my peripherals then ill definitely be buying another 
neutral,it is headset for small kids if it breaks it headset for kids 
neutral,serves its purpose for everyday use teacher who uses their laptop daily worked great for about months and then the middle wheel stopped working 
negative,not good at all but did pay cheap for it uncomfortable sound is not that good and short mic wouldn buy again 
neutral,it basically junk doesn hold charge it works fine as long as its plugged into the charger but that defies the purpose of wireless mouse
neutral,i bought this mouse few months ago it worked very well for couple of months and now it has quit completely sorry to say my return time ended in april buyer beware 
positive,loved the look and feel of this mouse but after only weeks of school the usb completely came apart when pulled it out of my son chromebook there was no impact or anything to cause this and the kiddo was quite upset that it broke because he loves the look of this mouse as well as how it feels in his hand

positive,i use this at work it great everyone asks me about my keyboard all the time have adhd and it actually helps me focus 
positive,it worked great liked the low profile however it started to act up few days before and then stopped working after months tried it on two laptops with the same results 
positive,my order came fast and on time use this little mouse at work all the time it is lightweight and slim enough to put in my scrub pocket for travel easy to clean only thing see is that cannot tell when the battery runs low keep an extra mouse handy for those times but other than that no complaints 
positive,i bought this for my son and the microphone didn work what disappointment update the headset works good initially gave it star thinking it didn work we just found out it was my sons controller with the problem luckily we kept the headset and tried it on new controller and it works great 
neutral,backlight works good on imac 
neutral,bad ass headset love it 
neutral,ready to handle
positive,headphones are great sound quality is good and my voice is clear
negative,the microphone barely detects audio if you re talking at volume any less than screaming painfully uncomfortable to wear with glasses and the sound quality isn much better than my old headset which ve had for years even for only expected something could use for at least minutes before it gave me headache 
positive,i have bought this item and its worked out perfectly 
neutral,received first time and it was not working exchanged and the mouse started acting up after few weeks

neutral,this is my nd jbl bluetooth speaker also own the jbl charge love both speakers the sound is good for such small speaker small size easy to take along the battery is great can run this for hours on end and still more than charged think it has battery life and believe it waterproof too nothing but love for this speaker 
negative,this mouse was disappointing it would work for while and then it would lose connection and stop working thought at first it was losing traction and wasn sensing movement so bought an entirely new mousepad did the same thing after few minutes of use it would lose connection 
neutral,the mouse was great it worked very good at first but one day it suddenly stopped charging so haven used it in while 
neutral,great quality earmuffs are soft but after awhile they get uncomfortable would be better if it lit up without having the usb plugged somewhere so if using with controller don count on it lighting up unless can plug the usb cable somewhere
positive,i love this mouse it quiet and pretty and the battery lasts while probably charge it once maybe twice week
positive,the item is actually nice the size color and lights are very cute and love that is rechargeable the only issue encounter was that when you leave it idle for few seconds and then try to use it it gets super slow and lags have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal don know if that is feature to save power or if mine is defective ll try to reach out to the seller has anyone else experienced this issue 
positive,depth of sound it just notch below the bose speaker bought four years ago but bose quality has now gone down so am happy with this jbl one although it is bit bulky it has very long battery life and gets very loud when needed 
negative,broke with barely any use the mic stopped working literally the same week bought it
positive,great value my grandson love it
positive,i love this mouse its slim and fits perfectly in my hand highly recommend for daily use
positive,great product and great response with questions 
neutral,product is fine but it super limited to what it can do you are stuck with the rainbow colors for the lights which is not what the description sounds like so would say this is nearly false advertisement based off of wording but it probably translated through levels of google translate so who knows obviously is membrane keyboard and it very squishy the lighting isn bad and the only gamer thing about this is the rgb you can control would have rather had completely red one am going to find another keyboard and return this one for its lack of functionality 
positive,better than any other portable speaker have purchased looses quality as volume increases but you shouldn be buying this to fill large room anyway use it as remodel our house and it functions great 
neutral,the scroll wheel broke after only month 
positive,this mouse has been so much better on my wrists it sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist love the rechargeable aspect because no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements it is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away so many colors to choose from too 
negative,these headphones stopped working after days the mm headphone jack is also loose and not good fit don throw the packaging away 
positive,this keyboard is easy on the eyes and very responsive you can also drop it and spill water on it and it just keeps on ticking 
neutral,the speaker is faulty it won turn off if press the power button it just turns right back on some of the buttons don work properly either pressing the volume down button shuts the power off and still it turns back on automatically it annoyingto hear the startup sound and shut down sounds all day and night as it turns itself on and off automatically 
negative,don buy it for one is very inconvenient rechargeable you never know when mouse is out of juice two mouse is dead after just months
positive,very much worth it for the price mic and sound is better than some expensive ones ve bought would definitely buy again 
positive,there nothing disliked used it for gaming the noise cancellation was amazing and love the sound quality 
positive,klim customer service is amazing first keyboard got wouldn connect and became dud within weeks of use they sent brand new one and it been perfect still use it and it good for generic typing however after continuous everyday use for hours week ve begun to choose to only use it on days may be less busy typing less quickly the longer use it or the more have to quickly type it will glitch out it adds unnecessary keys know did not hit or will duplicate key stroke hello looks like heelloo all in all good witless keyboard love that it can be charged with cord battery life is great wakes up quickly and has good response time after sleeping it just can be expected to put up with long intermittent time frames of over wpm typing 
neutral,battery life is not hours dies after playing at the pool for hours everyone once in while the sound cuts in and out like my phone is too far away except it will be within range recommend getting something similar at lower price point because am not satisfied also what with these companies assuming that we have extra charging blocks to plug in cords 
positive,this product is very good and nice to hold and use will recommend this mouse to everybody 
positive,i wish would have read more reviews before purchasing it is decent little speaker but it definitely has the monosound as people have described love the color 
positive,the mouse worked for couple weeks but now the scroller just spins freeling and won scroll one through pages really disappointed because the mouse as whole worked pretty well for the last couple weeks hopefully just defective model will be returning the item and seeking replacement
positive,great thin ergonomic mouse like the surrounding blue light
positive,i do like how they light up but they add nothing to sound quality the sound quality seems good will update in few months on how they are holding up 
positive,very cheaply made it was the biggest waste of my money the piece that plugs into the usb port broke in weeks time as was taking it out of the port it can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it dont know that its worth it guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed it was pretty cool how it lights up it is very lightweight as well which will leave that to your own interpretation 
neutral,yesterday the microphone was working fine today the microphone sounds like miles away nothing changed on my computer the headset is just piece of crap 
positive,great headset perfect for ps 
positive,the sound is amazing for such smaller product it produces lot of sound 
neutral,we liked the first one so much that we bought nd one for my husband to use for traveling 
positive,great product delivery and price 
positive,i very happy with this bluetooth speaker it sounds terrific and is pretty powerful in an open room 
negative,i had similar mouse that lasted two years this one died after only month would work after charging for few minutes and then stopped 
neutral,the sound quality is fair and mic works fine the feel is very plastic and light 
positive,i loved this mouse it is super lightweight and the color is lovely sometimes would forget to charge it after week week and half so that was on me to try to remember but just yesterday it stopped charging usually the light turns blue when it charging which is great indicator so left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop this morning when tried to use the mouse it didn work thought maybe hadn plugged it in properly but just now when plugged it in tested out several different usb ports on my laptop the blue charging indicator light flickered for second and then went out it seems that this mouse is not charging anymore making it basically useless 
positive,i bought this for my new laptop because really don like the finger pads on laptops it is truly plug and play and works awesome plus it looks really sleek 
positive,when my year old wired mouse finally died started looking at replacement options have never liked wireless mice due to the constant need for batteries and finding some in the office or while traveling is always huge pain finding out that there are rechargeable options out there was game changer so far after about two weeks of use love feel of the mouse the pointer speed which is adjustable and well the fact that just plug it in to charge while the receiver is usb and comes with an adapter for usb the charging port on the mouse is micro usb the charging cable that comes with is usb to micro usb inches incase you want longer one like did one thing though do have small hands so the size is perfect someone with small to medium sized hands will like the feel and size of the mouse if you have large hands it may feel to small all in all liked it so much ordered nd one for my work laptop bag to replace the wired mouse that travel with 
neutral,sound quality is good mic doesn work decent pair of headphones 
neutral,i like the fact that can connect it with my wife and daughter jbl flip 
negative,i ordered silver and received black not worth the time to return it but bit disappointing quality functions as expected
positive,i wanted to just like it mean it worked but honestly it felt like kids cheap dollar tree toy just can imagine that it will last long should have known better with the price anyway returned it 
neutral,this device sounds great it little bass heavy when listening indoors but outdoors it just right the only thing dislike is the charging indicators being on the bottom of the device so you have trouble seeing them when charging for the price it would have been nice to include usb charger 
positive,these are my very first pair of headphones for gaming so far love them haven had them long enough to give more details but will update for sure 
positive,this item is perfect for my husbands warzone game we love the mute option as well 
positive,perfect beat purchase have made this year 
positive,this is cute and slim and love that don have to replace batteries just charge it up when my computer is not in use use it for web browsing as well as basic gaming 
negative,the good the price and they work the bad very short coord more suited for laptop user than desktop requires both usb and mm ports to be used for either to work disconnect one and headset stops very poor sound its too quiet forget noise cancellation you can hear your phone ring on medium with these on full sound on youtube for some reason the left ear is hotter than the right side assuming because mic is on the left side have bought headphones half this price from sades that had much better sound and coord length but sadly they didnt have red and black anymore should of went with blue and black this headset was twice as expensive and nothing to be happy about will not buy another from this company
positive,first one received only lasted one week but the return process was quick do really like the second one mainly because of the lights know shallow right 
neutral,pretty lights but when it sleeps you have to turn it off and wait ten seconds and turn it back on stopped working completely less than month after buying so now its light up paper weight
positive,got these for the kids chromebook best thing yet kids like the lights and they are easy for them to use 
positive,love how slim it is and battery free charge like cell phone and the beautiful colors that surrounds the mouse is outstanding
neutral,i don like one thing made in china 
neutral,i buy it again
positive,just what wanted love it very loud and heavy duty
positive,overall comfortable headset with sensitive omni directional mic bit too sensitive at times great price point and aesthetic 
neutral,great sound mic not the best and sometimes hard to hear mute button does clicking sound that the other person can hear every time
neutral,scroll wheel broke after one day only used for less than an hour and it no longer scrolls and isn connected in the correct position anymore very light use hopefully replacement will be better quality if remember ll update review after using replacement 
negative,tried times using this in the week ve had it even checked to make sure it was fully charged turned it off on several times and no improvement movement of cursor is very slow delayed very disappointed with functionality went back to using my battery operated mouse

positive,i love this this so pretty battery life has been good only charged once so far in weeks
neutral,looks good so far
positive,i like the way it handles while moving it think it is little small for big hand it is cute and colorful have not played any games with it yet but am sure it will be quick and smooth 
positive,great sound nice deep bass 
positive,fast shipping and fast delivery works really well and fits perfectly love it 
positive,its nice to carry around as portable charger that can play music as for sound quality your better off purchasing the flip which outperforms the charge the only upside found was that the charge was better and deep tones flip for the win
positive,worked good for week cheap and doesn work anymore tried to change battery but can open it and if it opens can figure it out order something else not this one did love the light on it 
negative,the sleep mode is ridiculous they stated the lights keep on seconds and nit true they stay few seconds worst keyboard ever

neutral,great sound bluetooth connectivity is impeccable connect times out of with no issues have purchased of these and both meet sound quality standards 
positive,i love it easy to install and use mouse is soft and movies easily 
neutral,it didn fit the controller
neutral,regardless of where you plan to use this product home school or work you can go wrong with this product it quality product at great price ve had mine less than week now and just ordered another one add little light in your life 
neutral,sounds quality was fine but stopped working within months kept the cord straight and didn bend it much but it losing connection
negative,has cool look and very comfortable but after just few days it stopped working it sucks because ordered this head of time for my son for easter and unfortunately the return window has closed so out and my son has no headset 
neutral,if you only need to use mouse for no more than an hour this might be okay bought for my office for my laptop bag and for home they do not hold charge 
neutral,this worked great at first but have to keep it on power or it will only last about hours after about months 
neutral,stopped working after week even if plugged it into the computer
negative,regularly stops tracking movement into disjoint and jerky cursor movement seems to depend on the color of the surface underneath based on my multicolor mousepad oem harassed me with emails about changing my review amazon leaked my email that was only given to amazon 
neutral,can evaluate the battery life because it brand new 
neutral,definitely serves purpose and matches my decor 
positive,work very good fast with good lighting on it very good product
neutral,loved this product but the scroll recently stopped working and must turn it off and on during use 
neutral,i was not given charging cord with this speaker
neutral,it can also be jumpy on the pointer use it with linux so can configure it 
negative,tends to lose juice quickly and not so great with my macbook pro another mouse added to the boneyard
neutral,it stopped working after days 
positive,this is great economical mouse love the colored led lights and works perfectly great deal 
neutral,great mouse for price thought it was bluetooth but its not still good though
neutral,i bought jbl charge in came with an extra long usb cord and power brick now you get measly ft long cable
positive,he has had these headphones for year now and they still work great
neutral,my son loves corded headphones and this was really nice one doesn drowned out all noise but does the job for the money
negative,you sound very terrible on this headset you can mute yourself even with doing the mic mute switch and your sound is very quiet compared to other head sets it cheaper than most head sets but their are some big setbacks would not buy again would not recommend
positive,love this mouse havent had to charge it at all since got it amazing
neutral,just spend the extra money on mouse that will actually last you more than two uses highly annoyed
positive,these are comfortable headphones wear them even with no music on when there noisy distractions outside they re also great for phone calls 
neutral,normal daily use for few weeks scroller suddenly caved in today and stopped working positive reviews must be from people who haven owned it for long or mine was just damaged during shipping nevertheless honestly didn know computer mice could even break returning 
positive,son loved it 
neutral,it nice keyboard
neutral,careful with this one bought it last month the return window closed oct and it broke today any chance of good will exchange folks 
positive,i love the ruggedness of this speaker its punchiness and especially the fact that you can link together devices however you must upgrade the firmware to version it easy to do with the app do it when first got this device the sound quality was awful on low volumes it was like there was some kind of gating effect enabled that ate quiet sounds what worse when held it up to my eat could still hear digital noise from the bluetooth connection at low volumes it gave kind crackling effect yikes as last resort tried upgrading the firmware wasn too hopeful because the changelog said fixes minor bugs lol well it turns out that it fixed the low volume gating effect which consider to be major blocker like to listen to quiet music at night so this was huge relief whew i
neutral,this product already fell apart it very lightly used and the mouse is broken already 
negative,and it only wireless half the time the other half you ll have it plugged in and charging because charge doesn last very long that why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse that makes it hard to use when charging everyone knows it easier to drag chain up hill than to push it up well everyone but these people update the battery has completely gone dead it won even take charge anymore after only three months you have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast you have to wait to seconds for it to charge just so you can use it for another seconds it even worse than the star rating gave it originally 
positive,update lost my favorite mouse today bought it on jun reviewed it aug and it died yesterday aug so the mouse lasted appx weeks two and half months is pretty disappointing lifespan the battery died so plugged it in as always yet it doesn connect anymore ve tried removing the usb transmitter rebooting the computer plunging it in and out and turning it off and on but nothing even tried re charging it but nope it lost cause bought this mouse to replace the wireless logitech was using for my laptop it died and decided to try this rechargeable mouse from okimo never heard of the brand but impressed this first charge lasted so long that almost forgot it was rechargeable bought it in mid june it aug today and just on my second charge the first charge lasted over month this mouse does shut off after it idle for while and sure that is the secret to the long battery life just quick left click and it back in business almost immediately love the slim feel of this mouse it works beautifully thought the changing light would bother me old but it doesn it more like pleasant subdued highlight effect ll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so don get them mixed up 
positive,smooth and comfortable like the feel of ease while using definitely recommend this mouse
neutral,the sound quality was good but it barely picked up my voice and always had constant ringing noise whenever plugged it in
positive,great product for the price my daughter loves it it is so quiet when you re clicking the buttons that you can hear it at all so have decided to purchase myself one as well 
positive,really great for the mouse really light and wow just passed my expectations would buy again 
positive,the thumbnail makes this look like it is class headset and to it credit the sound quality is better than any set of earbuds or headphones that have ever used however the build quality is very poor it feels cheap the plastic feels like something that would be purchased in dollar store purchased something that looked similar on here about year ago and it surprised me in the complete opposite way leading me to believe that you do not need big brand name or tons of positive reviews to get good decent product but guess lightning doesn always strike twice kept these since it didn seem worth the hassle in returning them and it is still good to have backup set especially one that don care about but if had choice to purchase different pair would and am advising you to do the same 
neutral,i wanted product that thought have for at least the semester since ve purchased it the ball that scrolls down up is no longer working makes mouse almost pointless to have seems am going to need new mouse 
neutral,good for its intended purpose very light and flimsy but it works so far 
neutral,works well does what it supposed to do
neutral,worked well for while but then stopped working completely after months it would charge but not turn on 
positive,my son loved it to play video games 
neutral,started off good about weeks in it wouldn move fully charged 
neutral,after months of use and the scroll wheel is broke
positive,this mouse is great for what use it for like the rgb effects not really designed for gaming

positive,got on prime day and super happy best deal ever 
neutral,even with sleep mode the battery doesn last full work day 
positive,i bought this for my grandson to use with his chromebook for school he is loving it 
neutral,i had the mouse charging all weekend when returned to work monday morning smelled something hot but no one else smelled anything went to unplug my mouse and my cord was so hot couldn even touch it the entire cord melted and the wires had burned through the rubber coating very easily could have caught my computer on fire do not buy this mouse unless you have great fire insurance 
positive,great headphones especially for the price the sound quality is awesome 
positive,the mouse is sleek and comfortable enjoy the sleep mode because am terrible about turning off my mouse when not using setup is simple since it has an adapter

positive,it really awesome headset my son loves it
neutral,barely had them month and the left ear already has short now they tried to pay me to remove the review don trust them 
negative,i bought two of them we didn use them every day but they both broke after months it is waste of money and you should not buy them 
negative,i have had of these the first mouse ordered worked fine until the mouse just felt loose and didn respond was able to get replacement and was satisfied the replacement did the same thing got it in jan and today the scroll wheel just felt loose and didn respond waste of money do not recommend 
positive,maybe just unlucky given the reviews but they mouse won hold charge simply doesn work also the connectors are flush with each other feels cheap 
neutral,junk quality have had other cheap brands these are junk quality sounds muffled basically have to scream into the microphone too
positive,noise cancellation and output sound was fine however the microphone leaves lot to be desired people on the other end could barely hear me and said sounded like was super far away there is also no way to adjust the microphone so that it sits closer to your face it in fixed position 
positive,i love this mouse and can wait to get another one just like it use this one at work and it very comfortable and not loud clicking either 
neutral,constantly times out or goes to sleep and every time try to move it to use it again it takes me having to sit there and shake it for ten seconds at first not big deal but do that for few weeks and it incredibly frustrating went back to my old mouse ll know next time to pay for better mouse 
positive,love it
neutral,first months was nice but after that they do not work anymore 
neutral,started out pretty good but after about weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly even after charging all night after about to minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements 
negative,received this in end of july already dead no longer charges nothing 
positive,my son is happy with this headset setup easily and sound great 
positive,i absolutely love this little speaker for its size it is truly incredible and it has been very durable the ability to connect multiple together is very useful connected to of them and not of the larger speakers together and used them as the sound system for my outdoor wedding worked great 
neutral,good product
positive,sound quality bluetooth size is amazing 
neutral,shipping took long time if you are wanting mouse quickly buy some place else then it stopped working after months stay away

neutral,it works for now will see after some time 
neutral,solid design and sound to fill variety of spaces 
positive,crisp clean sound throughout all the ranges sounds awesome am very pleased with this speaker 
positive,love how it looks when it changes colors comes with adapter charging cord and live the fact that it is rechargeable and the price was amazing
neutral,product was defective 
positive,sound quality is great confortable to wear 
positive, pros quiet smooth no delays or lagging issues so far pretty colors when not moving the mouse cons seems bit cheap little flatter than like doesn fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable the red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you re moving the mouse want to see the various colors even when moving the mouse not red led light shining through which is overpowering some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show the right side of the mouse right handed doesn emit the colors as vividly as the left side next to my thumb one small section is almost inoperative ll probably be returning it as have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn emit the red led like this one it was super cheap fortunately in case keep it who knows guess you get what you pay for 
positive,sounds great long battery
negative,i ve now bought of these headsets both had mic failure after only couple hours of use spend the money on something of higher quality 
positive,it is sleek and like the fact that can charge it on my computer it does light up and it works great after sitting for while the mouse needs to wake up by pressing the right click 
positive,i tried to get my daughter nice mouse for her minecrafting and man what waste of this mouse was it connected to its included dongle just fine but almost broke nail taking the dongle out of the mouse body if you don have something slim to wedge in between the dongle and the mouse body prepare for some ouchies do you like the rainbow effect well hope you also enjoy less than day of battery life is your battery dead now welp can charge and use the mouse at the same time do you think it be nice to use long braided usb cord as wire for this mouse nope the micro usb only supports charging not data don hate yourself don get budget mouse if you want good mouse for roughly more check out the razer basilisk it supports bluetooth usb and it has excellent battery life my son uses it every day for minecraft roblox youtube and purchased it at the end of january it is now mid may and ve changed its single aa only once you won be disappointed 
positive,great gift 
neutral,sound is awesome great depth from treble to bass gets loud but not muffled like cheap speakers battery goes forever 
negative,used this mouse twice went to use it third time and it was completely dead the led were still working but the mouse light underneath flickers then shuts off after being turned on waste of money 
positive,price and sound are wonderful on these headset and their definitely worth the cost have of their headsets but as stated before quality is what you pay for headset will nomally last about months months in the mositerproof covering of the foam heatset randommly started peeling off like paper matche so the form headesets will gradually peel off its really purely cosemtic for now but if your ocd like me then it will bother you that beingvsaid the company is awesome on support and trues to resolve any issues they stand by their products so still must buy
negative,i an very unhappy with this products uses less than year the wire on usb adapter is broke and the mouse no longer work not happy at all can send back so you can look at it 
neutral,reacts little slow
positive,love our new speaker but downsides it not as loud as we figured it would be good sound indoors but not nearly loud enough outdoors also sometimes it connects to phone first try but other times it takes much longer and is very hard to connect same with pairing it to another jbl speaker 
positive,everything seems great so far 
positive,i travel for work so this wireless mouse is perfect it small for packing away and the sleep mode keeps it going longer charge it about every days 
negative,horrible just horrible
neutral,the roller on top of the mouse quits working or falls down in the mouse the colors and lights are fun but the mouse itself is defective have had at this point and will not buy another 
neutral,it is little slippery in the hand but have been using pc mouse 
negative,i wanted to do stars on this but do have slight issue with the design of the keyboard itself it may be the best keyboard you have owned really ve just broken so darn many it unfunny not this model yet my main gripe is the whole function key is right side only which wouldn be horrible for me if wasn consistently used to handed volume and media controll may have just bought the wrong keyboard there are other options this is the one bought and it was bucks and not pleased with it due to this again may work wonders for you non media junkie 
neutral,this mouse lasted days just passed the returnable date just quite working no matter how many hours let it recharge 
positive,my kids use for xbox and talk to their friends noise canceling for sure as they can hear me when call them up for dinner or tell them to turn off the game and go to bed great value 
positive,perfect mic quality and noise cancellation
neutral,just pay for headset this one isn worth it
neutral,at first it worked perfectly fine then notice the movements on my pc screen became slow and laggy then it finally did waste of time and money 
neutral,loved the mouse and was using it regularly for months just recently the scrolling wheel completely stopped working all of the other functions work but the scrolling feature is must for me 
neutral,loved it at first but it stopped charging so it doesn work anymore
positive,the keyboard is great and much more quiet than others gaming keyboards issue with power port which is flimsy and does not stay connected adequately

neutral,this keyboard met all my expectations 
neutral,it nice product for watching movies

positive,its strong clear and great
positive,very nice responsive
neutral,bought this to use for noise cancelation at my office
neutral,the laser is sporadic mouse icon jumps around randomly 
neutral,the cursor acts erratically and the left and right buttons respond poorly one must work twice as hard to use this than any other mouse have ever had seek elsewhere go to local store where you can easily return the thing if you need to 
positive,one day delivery was great well packaged and installed in no time 
positive,came charged has an off on and then the color switch quiet quick my favorite mode is that when it idle for while it shuts down and you just click and it comes back to life exactly what wanted easy usb charge hope it lasts me for while 
negative,i bought this mouse just over month ago and it has already stopped working awful product and waste of money 
positive,i just love this the lights are awesome going to buy more

positive,headset was good while it lasted just over days wrapped cord for better durability clearly not resilient and that was with fairly mild kiddo 
positive,great
neutral,was really cool until it stopped working so had to return 
negative,waste of money only worked for week then died left it alone for few days thinking maybe just over used it cause it was cheap 
negative,the battery of this mouse works well haven timed it but have left it on overnight and it stills has battery not gamer but imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the pc setup recently switched from laptop that had the standard rectangular port usb to one that needed the adapter usb the adapter that comes with the mouse worked for about minute before it stop functioning so brought out my own adapter from different device and the mouse now works also tested both adapters with wired mouse it suffices to say that it was the mouse adapter that is not working could have gotten faulty one so the problem could be exclusive to me tl dr mouse adapter didn work ur screwed if urs doesn work either and don have an extra one 
positive,it works really well and have no problem with it 
positive, so it extra light easy to work and love it for the price no pesky batteries
positive,great all around speaker sound battery life price and portability 
positive,good product very nice
neutral, like the color thought it was going to have changing colored lights it only close red which was disappointing it also kind of flat and smaller than expected overall mean does what need it to do 
positive,my first mouse ordered in july started acting wild not able to control where the cursor went contacted the company and they did send me new one to replace and did not ask for me to return the first one which was great however the roller on the second mouse has now stopped working it is great looking and comfortable mouse wished it had worked afraid to try third

positive,excellent speaker
positive,i love this speaker so many good things to say battery life is great sound quality is awesome and the think like the most is the bluetooth range have not seen any other device with such an impressive range am now building an abs pipe mount for my atv so that can just stop the jbl in and ride away 
positive,i have no complaints about this mouse use it daily and it works great love the fact it has led lights recommend this product 
positive,i was tired of the wire noises and the knots they created it was always mess plus it stopped working hence was looking for mouse this mouse is amazing it is light easy to connect the led works good doesn make sound and the customer service is good if you are looking for mouse with low budget this is definitely the one you are looking for

positive,love it 
neutral,it was little loose for my small head but other than that no problems with the mic or sound quality

positive,final update received new headset and surprise working mic this new headset also has better audio quality thankful they really care about their customers thank you update they saw my negative review and have emailed me to try to fix the problem with either refund or replacement excellent customer service ve decided to give them another chance and ask for replacement will update with the results for the price and what needed to do it works however the mic doesn even work at all ended up using my antlion mod mic wireless and it works fine the sound is okay but that what you get for choosing price over quality 
neutral,we connected correctly would not work after multiple attempts came broken 
positive,these headphones sound great ordered them for the wrong purpose but my husband uses them and loves them will probably be ordering them for the other gamers in my family dagbuy
positive,headset works great ear muffs are deep and large enough that they cover my ears fully with no pressure points normally when wear headset my ears start to hurt after min or so not the case with this headset very comfortable to wear for long periods of time at the office or gaming sessions

negative,the design is pretty but the functionality is crappy my mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the nd floor last week

positive,this speaker is great everyone in the family loves it 
positive,i ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way the scroller do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful won be buying third one but if that not gonna be problem for you then these will probably be great they hold charge well and the light show they put on is really cool

negative,horrible piece of trash worst mouse ever don buy this 
positive,they work perfectly for my year old gamer would definitely recommend and the lighting is really cool looking

negative,poor sound quality cuts in and out and sounds staticky crackly 
positive,comfortable headset 
negative,the mouse does well use it daily for work it lasts long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when am not using it so battery is not wasted sometimes can go weeks without charging my only complaint is the wheel have had it about months and the wheel started squeaking recently people can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts this is my rd wireless mouse the other were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all was common complaint on those 
neutral,exactly what was looking for but get longer micro usb to usb charging cable the one it comes with is only about inches long just long enough to charge off your laptop 
positive,so far my husband is loving it would prefer non colored mode 
neutral,was so excited to get this it stopped working after one month changed the battery but no go bought it to relieve my carpal tunnel pain and that was great but it just stopped working 
positive,loved it 
positive,i am very impressed with the resolution of these speakers bought two of them highly recommend these speakers 
neutral,this mouse was great at first but after week the scrolling part stopped working 
positive,bought it in march and now the roller thing does not work mouse was never dropped opened and found that the attachment of the roller is broken it works as intended and love that it is rechargeable ll buy another one if it lasts long enough then maybe the first one is just fluke

positive,got this for my wife she loves it great sound pairs easily and has enough bass 
positive,great product very competitive price 
positive,i bought the fli few years ago to take with me when travel for work wanted something little bigger for use around the house and this speaker was great choice great sound quality and great volume for around the house easily pairs with other jbl products also 
negative,this mouse really only worked for about two months now it seems to need to be charged more frequently takes long time to charge and does not move smoothly it sort of sticks to the point that it is very annoying to use 
neutral,my buddy printed me some mounts for my can am maverick xmr turbo and the speakers is plenty loud enough for me to hear on the trail and battery lasted all day and then some 
neutral,had it for three months and it was working fine loved that the click was quiet and it was lightweight but it stopped charging and working out of nowhere 
neutral,i bought my first set on july and they were great broke wire and was so satisfied with the first set ordered the exact same model but on the new ones unless turn the column down really really low the sound distorts thought would like these as much as the last ones so destroyed the box wish hadn or would send this back in heartbeat if you order and get set that does not distort you will be happy with them but these that distort and not much pumpkin 
positive,purchased as gift for my nephew he really likes it 
neutral,it works
positive,mouse was great for about hours when it stopped working mouse even snake would not like worthless 
positive,i love the different colors easy to find at night holds charge for few days 
positive,super cute mouse love the color and love the led lights my only issue is that it very glitchy like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn good sit at desk for hours and it completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own 
positive,my son loves it great product 
positive,i am by no means headset snob have some specifications that want met for gaming headset these headphones check lot of boxes but not all of them unfortunately will be looking for new headset because the microphone is pretty muffled am in party chat days week my friends have stated that the mic is muffled and kind of muddy louder sounds make their way through the mic for example gunshots loud animal calls in hunting game loud screams effects from scary game etc the mic is fixed this is obvious with the photos but didn realize how much it would effect me can adjust how close or far the mic is from my mouth and therefore can really try to fix mic quality the plastic quality is ehh it feels little cheaper but you get what you re paying for with budget headset the bass was not all that impressive have had lot worse but also much better as well say it bass rating and this is one of the most important features for me everything else about the headset is great but don recommend it for gaming with friends their best features include long braided cord crisp loud and powerful sound comfortable and light with great quality earmuffs great designcons fixed mic bad mic quality not best for really small losing sound quality or really large losing comfort head lacking amazing bass
positive,there amazing quality haedphones
neutral,this is an update to my last review it has been months and it stopped working bought this because of the price and color next time will go with more reputable company 
positive,i have gotten so many compliments on this mouse first off the rose gold color is so beautiful and dainty when first started using fell in love that in changes colors and has the capability to turn off highly recommend great price as well 
positive,the headset feels nice and sounds pretty good for the price my one complaint is the mic is not flexible at all and comes off as pretty quiet 
positive,i really love this mouse bought it for my office to get rid of the cords the colors are nice and like that it goes to sleep when not in use ve gotten many compliments on it 
neutral,meh it was ok it broke when threw it
neutral,i bought this in august and finally managed to get it to work after just few minutes of using it the the roller to scroll stopped working you can feel when the spring gave way while was using not sure if it can be fixed
neutral,recommend it 
positive,third different one purchased like this because of all the positive reviews can believe them garbage right out of the box again won pair with the usb receiver won hold battery charge all done with these rechargeable garbage wireless mice 
neutral,my mouse broke in just four days waist of money 
neutral,after connected this mouse whole mechanism fxxxxx up 
neutral,cheaply made mine broke already barely used and it came apart and can snap it back together short charge life though it is convenient to have charge vs battery 
positive,it worked great while it worked but after less then three months my mouse has stopped working it turns on and lights up but will no connect to the usb wirelessly any more won buy again and wouldn recommend if you re looking for something to last 
positive,it an adequate speaker for this price point ll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine do not feel like wasted money but if when buy another of these types of speakers it won be jbl it been at least years since ve bought one of these bt speakers and my last speaker was just as loud clear cost less had features that just worked and even came with lanyard for easy carry this thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands volume and sound quality it loud in room with no ambient noise my music is mostly rock like metallica pantera white zombie like loud music and for my private office it perfect ll mostly listen at volume so can think but it nice to jam out sometimes at middle volume level the sound is the best lows vs highs above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise you could use this in an environment with ambient noise like warehouse or kitchen but you would need to stay around if you want to really enjoy what is playing after it probably going to sound more like noise than music phone connectivity is simple for music just push top button but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker had in the price point there are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this the manual certainly is no help but it not what needed it for just liked it as nice side feature used sometimes with my last speaker like this battery life is fine haven done complete testing on this it does have pretty significant battery in it for the charge your device option but hrs maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music won need it for longer than hrs most of the time so doubt this will come up as an issue for me there an app but it does very little for this speaker most useful feature is digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker thankfully for it main function of bt connecting and playing music it pretty basic and simple if you go the route of multiple speakers reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work it is not intuitive it series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews 
negative,it cool mouse the led features are nice and it pretty but hate when have to move it sporadically for good seconds before the mouse moves on the screen ve tried different mouse pads and it still happens it extremely frustrating and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it you have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now it also makes an irritating high pitched noise when you move it 
neutral,this keyboard can hold solid connection feet away from the computer even at full charge keyboard flickers on and off while type customer support number is fake buyer beware 
positive,nice little mouse have gotten compliments on it functions as expected 
positive,this was my second purchase pared with another charge to get stereo great sound the bass could be deeper but it still is acceptable two issues are there is no user manual and no wall charger so to pair two speakers had to rely on youtube to set it up also had to contact them to get wall charger specs using one that has volt amp output play the speakers at medium loud volume at best the battery is fairly depleted after to hours it would be great if they offered sub woofer 
positive,if you are looking for an entry level headset this is great good sound and good noise reduction for the price you can go wrong 
neutral,this mouse was great up until today when the scroll finger pad completely broke the scroll function is loose and now wont work at all 
positive, alright first of all the reason here writing this is lost one of these off the bed of my truck at about mph on an asphalt road it dropped rolled and bounced into the ditch and found it few hours later see video now first thing thought was this thing toast nope not this speaker dang thing fires right up and goes right back to playing solid sounds love these speakers have since day one here after year of pretty consistent use to say still love these speakers battery life is great for the sound they put out the connectivity option to listen with multiple at one time is the reason bought them and love that would buy again jbl or bust in my book 
neutral,not good sound
positive,yeah this thing is pretty great honestly it works really well and is completely silent which really like at work don like to be constantly clicking all the time the rubberized feel is also very satisfying and mean very satisfying overall you really can go wrong here for the price 
negative,this is great keyboard for the price the keys are mushy it not particularly comfortable and it runs out of battery more quickly than like but it water proof consistent and inexpensive if you re someone like me who has history of drowning expensive keyboards in water look no further ve already tried to ruin this keyboard couple of times but quick wipe down and it keeps chugging along this is tremendous keyboard for the price 
positive,great sound
positive,it won turn on anymore only used it for weeks it rip off don get it it on as you see but won actually turn on 
positive,used it for ps works great
neutral,th mouse sucks only worked day after that it never worked again never buying it again 
negative,so my review after using this mouse for months there are lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another the mouse stops working in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged you have to turn off the mouse put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again will not recommend this mouse to anyone couple days later the mouse has completely stopped working and there no customer service response update the mouse is still not working have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company but they don respond the quality of customer service update it been over months since got the replacement even the replacement is horrible it stops responding the action time is delayed when you left click it doesn respond this is even after carefully keep the mouse 
neutral,i bought one and the piece going into my laptop didn work the second broke easily 
neutral,great at first then after month it stopped working it like the battery was weak and it was slow to respond to movement and felt sticky do not recommend 
neutral,this was really good mouse quiet clicks very lightweight and it moved smoothly over my mouse pad it fell opened up bit was able to put it clip it back in but after the third fall the ball stopped working but for the price it def worth it long battery life think charged like middle of every other week and used it from weekdays for about hours 
positive,i bought this for my work laptop and just love it easy to use and love that it is rechargeable fantastic design so it not hard on your hands and connects easily with no issues 
neutral,i suppose shouldn have expected much for the money 
positive,works great
positive,just plugged it in and it worked perfectly wanted small low profile mouse to use when travel so far this one seems great the chromebook travel with only has usb ports and did think that that this mouse came with usb receiver but it doesn it comes with usb receiver and an adapter which works fine but together they are over an inch long which is little awkward it means have to be very careful not to bump it and beak it if the receiver were smaller this would be ideal overall great value 
positive,love everything about it so far just hope it works longer than some of the other ones ve purchased 
neutral,it works just fine just not practical always have to recharge the battery it is bit of an annoyance 
positive,really great keyboard gamer and have had zero issues it has quick response time can tell the difference between this and my wired razor black widow keyboard my only feedback for the company would be to provide some sort of indication software or hardware based of how much battery life there is 
positive,great keyboard for the price
positive,works well ordered for my ten year old son to use with his ps and hes happy 
positive,love this take it on my paddle board bring it outside when have people over and bring it all around my apartment the sound quality is amazing it can get pretty loud too love that it waterproof sine spend lot of time on the lake 
positive,i bought this for gaming my dad said it will be total trash but he let me buy it it came pretty quick plugged it up to my ps controller and played some destiny the sound was stellar then plugged it to my brother pc and played some minecraft also good the only problem have with it is if you don have portable charger you can really use the lights unless you play pc lot on the back there is only one color light green the mic quality is really good compared to an ipad mic ve had it for few months really sturdy great for music great for gaming great for anything the noise canceling is not good but for say it epic 
positive,the charging cord was very flimsy and won charge any more lasted about week 
neutral,it did not come with usb cable to charge the mouse wasted my money 
positive,this mouse works perfectly for what bought it for it ergonomic chic colorful and works long time before needing to be charged it came quickly and was packaged nicely buy with confidence 
neutral,didn work when first bought it and did even bother with the refund don waste your time go to best buy 
negative,i hate this mouse doesn stay charged and sleep mode kicks in too quickly
negative,first purchase received the wrong color they switched it out no problem second mouse came and it stopped working within two three weeks because of the shipping coming from overseas the whole process just made the product less appealing disappointed it stopped working so soon

positive,lightweight comfortable and cool with the lights rechargable is major plus
positive,this was gift for yr old great nephew he loves it good purchase 
positive,amazing product works very well 
neutral,excelente producto
neutral,i only bought this for the silent keys have newborn baby and needed silent clicks but this keyboard was more loud than my current gaming keyboard if you need reviews on anything else please read elsewhere didn even connect it simply started typing and was disappointed stars being generousmaybe the company is comparing their keys to mechanical stroke keyboard if that were the case then every keyboard would be silent compared to those 
neutral,i have only used this shirt time it alright it does take minute to get used to the low profile my biggest complaint is that it didn come with charger as stated now have to find charger that will fit or spend more money to purchase charger just to ensure can recharge it 
positive,love this speaker this is the second one we have purchased very durable we take it on our atvs and camping my husband also uses it at work he in construction so it has to have good sound highly recommend 
neutral,battery and charge functions step up from next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers sound appears to be same quality as model below this one heavier than lower model bigger because of battery if you don need the features of the battery and charge options go with next model down in the jbl bluetooth speakers and save and less bulky
neutral,we used these one time and they worked great we tried to use them again an hour later and they didn work at all waste of money my boys were so disappointed 
positive,i just love this the lights are awesome going to buy more
neutral,i got it cause was tired of replacing batteries on my prev mouse works well and charge lasts over month with regular use hours week 
neutral,this is really great mouse it works as designed unfortunately don have the patience for the very slow response time it was aggravating waiting for it to respond to my finger commands needless to say got rid of it and bought something different 
neutral,broke as soon as it dropped on the floor 
positive,it very worth the prime day sale price and nearly worth retail selling price sound quality is very nice and can hear low frequency bass very well very easy to connect to and doubles as power bank if you need to charge your phone have not tested the water resistance but many others have look up videos testing it recommend this over other speakers in its price range but definitely get case for it 
neutral,this broke after weeks poorly put together 
positive,its lightweight absolutely love the changing colors 
positive,i like my new mouse needed an inexpensive yet durable mouse and this one has been great so far have only used it for day but so far so good great purchase 
positive,i really like it it good is the first time you pay for something that is doing the job 
neutral,pc mice ve purchased in the past lasted years not months caution purchase of this mouse for tha reason 
neutral,good product
neutral,sound quality
neutral,this mouse worked for day and then stopped it was very comfortable to use and silent click which was nice but it stopped working so it pointless 
positive,fits comfortably and it is very pretty 
positive,was trying to find mouse for my new laptop and came across this mouse the best one ve found like that it smooth and the color is super nice 
neutral,no complaints love it loud and clear 
neutral,bass is very good 
positive,i like the keyboard it works great the battery life is pretty decent has low button noise soft button presses just wish it would take longer for it to go into sleep mode and if there were different light up options to choose from but all in all pretty good product 
positive,the keys are responsive and the multi colored back lighting is an attractive feature the rechargeable battery lasts long time and charges very quickly though had small issue klim customer service was really very helpful heartily recommend this keyboard 
positive,it is awesome my son loves the lights and likes how it feels and sounds 
positive,this mouse worked great for the days it worked tried turning it on today and it wont light up or connect to my computer tried connecting with the cord provided but still wont work sucks because the outlook of the mouse was cool along with the led outlining 
neutral,disappointed for the rd time 
neutral,charged it for hours and hours and could never pair with my mac used the adaptor that was included and tried multiple times but was never able to use it definitely not easy to pair as it advertised 
neutral,it works well it does what purchased it for 
negative,the thing broke on me in two months the jbl is sending me new one what pain in the ass
neutral,dislike
positive,i bought the keyboard so could play games in the living room and it was working fine the lights were really pretty the keys felt clean and it was pretty easy to move around however less than month after bought it the backspace key key and key stopped working 
negative,disappointed with this product stops tracking after few seconds of usage regardless of how have it charged faulty product 
positive,i was insanely surprised by the overall quality of these use them on my ps and they sound way better than headset very surprising 
positive,cheap feeing but the ear foam is soft and nice 
neutral,false advertising no lights turn on like it shows on the picture want refund 
positive,great price
positive,plain and simple this is good quality loud and portable bluetooth speaker think if you want to get the job done the jbl line is it in the year ve had it ve inspired few friends to get their own after hearing and enjoying it don fuss with eq or other features because this is my portable party speaker and out the box it tuned just fine for that if you want the best sound quality with stereo and more settings you should will probably need to spend more than what this is to get notable improvement 
positive,its cool little mouse got it for work reasons like the rgb on it works as intended not really pricey 
negative,terrible product first mouse broke within week second mouse broke within months 
neutral,mac book pro mouse never worked money refunded
positive,i was really impressed with these headphones they are great canceling out other noise and can hear things in game that never even noticed when played through the tv speakers great purchase 
negative,it shame because love it but the keyboard has problems with several keys so far have verified that the keys and fail in the case of it sometimes works but not many
positive,that the first small speaker bought but really do like it it sounds clear and loud 
positive,i believe this is great purchase the size is not too small and not too large its shape is thin but comfortable the lighting is glamorous do use it on my laptop at home about week because of this shut the mouse off to save on the charge but have to say that the charge does hold for long time if you forget cord is provided and it measures about long which is perfect to plug in and continue to use the mouse as you work the price is reasonable and worth it would like to purchase another for work but fear that its projected beauty may peek someone interest 
positive,i just used this mouse for work few hours day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when flipped the switch after just days plugged it in to charge like done few times before and the blue light came on when the blue light went off unplugged it and switched it on but it flashed red couple of times and wouldn work repeated the process with the same outcome know it cheap mouse but wow got less than one day of use for every dollar spent 
positive,xmas gift great so far
neutral,this product works as described 
neutral,the scrolling mechanism stopped working within minutes of use didn drop it or handle it improperly it just piece of junk 
positive,great head phones
positive,this is headset at best not what expected question the reviews 
negative,the mouse worked adequately when it arrived after couple weeks it started going through periods where the sensor was unresponsive one minute and then worked fine the next at this point its mostly unusuable it has an annoying habit of losing connection and suddenly staring straight up while gaming makes fast paced competitive games nearly impossible waste your money on some other brand piece of junk mouse 
neutral,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matte feel and the lights its also very quiet and not clicky wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with laptop and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together with glue idk whenever take it out the usb drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustrating will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pc and never remove it itll last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it glitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly 
positive,good sound quality durability great for online school 
neutral,perfecf for the beach pool or park
neutral,stopped working after couple of weeks
positive,overall they re just really good headsets you can hear everything very well
positive,absolutely love this mouse if it were to break would buy this product again 
neutral,my friend has one of these and they sound great never had any problem with fedex or ups but everytime it usps something gotta go wrong giving it star because never received mine 
positive,the sound quality is good only thing is it would be nice if it can go louder higher volume 
positive,sounds great in rooms with punchy bass and crisp highs
positive,i loved my mouse and it worked great loved the light show and the fast response time with no lagging from the mouse then at weeks into having the mouse the type reciever that made the mouse work broke off was so bummed because really liked the mouse so took leap of faith and contacted the company to ask for replacement on just the receiver so that could use my mouse and they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and sent me brand new set at no cost lovely lady named iris helped me out thank you for being an honest company that stands behind the products you sell customer for life don hesitate to buy this item you wont regret it 
positive,this speaker really sounds great good battery life as well 
neutral,works really well
neutral,sleep mode
positive,works well easy to use stays charged for long time connects easily definitely good buy for the price
positive,it works great great audio great mic lights are cool too

positive,has great sound bluetooth connects fast and great battery like would buy it again 
positive,great product
positive,such nice product and at great price 
negative,not attractive when lit up because the light leaks through the white shell just not attractive
negative,i bought this to replace another that had used from august to december replaced the first one due to the spinner breaking was hoping that the new one would last longer but it only lasted weeks completely disappointed in it 
positive,this is great headset for the price it does what need it to do
positive,i didn realize that it was rechargeable vs battery however it gets the job done and it comfortable to use 
positive,i love this head set so much you can hear great it has not broke at all 
neutral,sound could be bit higher in quality 
positive,i actually use this for working from home and it actually makes your day more interesting seeing the pretty colors 
neutral,nice and soft but the laser isn very accurate
positive,my sister bought one last year and had to have one the sound is just beautiful definitely worth the price 
neutral,good product timely shipping 
positive,great mouse love it
positive,this is the second wireless mouse purchased both the same the first one works great have had it for while and love the look and feel the second one started sticking and locking up shortly after purchasing it hit or miss some days it fine other days want to throw it out the window 
neutral,my son was using it for his laptop for school and it stopped working didn want to work nomore 
positive,i have small hands and this fits perfectly very cute and lightweight
neutral,not bad as expected for the price clicks little loud when you click use it 
positive,signal works at great distance 
positive,i was just trying to buy cheap mic until could afford really nice one turns out don need nice mic any time soon it has crisp audio for gaming it works on the playstation xbox one and even the pc ve had mics that weren half as good as this one if you on budget you can get anything better than this 
positive,i have trouble getting it to keep up good audio sometimes it ok but it been going downhill steadily for year mic has only one axis of rotation so can get it closer to my mouth that part of the issue but only part it also not very comfy as the spring force is too strong and the earmuffs too firm overall they are cheap and they feel like it and sound like it would get something better were you 
positive,i love this mouse it has cute and ergonomic design and doesn need to be charged often the only thing don like about the matte black one is that it shows fingerprints easily 
neutral,it ok but getting the dongle out was quite the challenge not the greatest design on that part 
positive,looks pretty but not very responsive use it at work and have to back up and re read everything type as it misses letters adds extras if you even brush them with your finger which is the only time it works really well and spend way more time than should proof reading to make sure the keyboard isn making look like can type 
neutral,not fan wouldn sync with one computer worked great with the other computer but it didn sleep when was done with it so the next day the battery was dead ll never remember to turn off the mouse when not using it so this is not going to be very useful 
negative,it was working fine until the mouse wheel broke three weeks in now useless 
neutral,stopped working after weeks would not buy again 
positive,i ve had this for year just took it to the beach for second time got it wet got sand on it works perfectly it can bump as well but the mids aren super clear if you care about that my guess is most of you dont but do so took off star all together this is star device and if you want to annoy your roommate or put it in backpack and ride downtown with the volume all the way up you totally can and your phone will probably die first unless you rode the bike would purchase again 
positive,needed new pair of headphones for my ps these do the trick and love the comfort for my long gaming sessions 
positive, although it pretty it works great and love the colors got it for asthetics but it very functional work at home hours day and the charge is lasting quite long 
positive,it still quite new but working great so far 
positive,this mouse is absolutely done and performed as stated by the seller smooth movement and quiet clicks virtually no sound and love the light show it emits around the mouse if you are looking for great quality and functionality look no further because here it is 
positive,i guess did not realize that this was only rechargeable and did not take batteries but my daughter loves it 
neutral,the things hate about this keyboard were mentioned in the reviews but overlooked them this product is not made in the usa even though there is an american flag displayed suggesting it is the supplied cable is only feet long and does not insert fully into the keyboard so factor in the price of foot cable that does insert as had to do finally the keyboard lights time out after minute of non use even if you leave it plugged in and battery life is not an issue 
positive,great even at high volumes would recommend this product
positive,great purchage very satified
neutral,this was not easy hook up you have to do to much to connect to game and to get them to work just went to game stop and brought different ones my kids wanted to play there games
positive,i like it recommend 
positive,perfect for game nights
positive,got this as gift is the best gaming headset ve used in while
positive,very pleased with the keyboards feel and function simple yet durable feeling and the mechanical feel is great also must say that quite enjoyed learning about the team of specialists in the provided documents quite funny and entertaining have placed probably over orders over amazon and do not generally leave reviews but this company stuck out so wanted to give them shout out 
positive,very nice my son loves them 
positive,mouse doesn track well it also really flat and doesn feel good in my hand wish it had battery rather that cord or at least battery backup there is hard notch right below the when don know what it for bit it uncomfortable and gets in the way of using the wheel want to return but tossed the box it came in 
positive,they are great headphones for gaming or the purpose of working from home can beat the bang for the buck
neutral,good enough for the price but very awkward to handle middle mouse button is hard to push and often doesn actually get pushed despite making the sound 
positive,works great 
neutral,it connected immediately with my computer and makes no noise and like the ergonomics on the mousei can move my mouse faster than my other mouse
positive,the price of the mouse vs the functionality is amazing my son is really happy with it 
positive,my son love it 
positive,i love it it just perfect and the sound quality is so good also the battery life is exquisite
positive,recently started traveling for work and need good mouse for my laptop to travel withthis does the job and doesn break the bank highly recommend
neutral,the mouse works but after less than week of use by my son the roller ball no longer works you can scroll with it the rest of it works for now but will probably not make it through the school year 
neutral,the first few weeks it worked great then all of sudden the scroll stopped working and it just spins have to physically grab the side of the page to move down really disappointed

positive,i am very pleased with the quality on the device it does not feel cheap in any way for the price is lot better working that other more expensive ones is not too heavy which make it very comfortable to wear for hours in online tournaments the cushions seat perfectly around the ears isolating from external noise and making very clear the sound on the games even when these are considered entry level it is pleasure to use them while playing all my games also use them to play music and the surround sound is amazing can hear every instrument with absolute clarity guess will be updating this review as the time goes by but for now will say that am very pleased with all the characteristics and for the price you cant go wrong frank
neutral,it seemed to work ok for couple of days and then started noticing that it wasn moving my cursor where wanted it to go sometimes have to move it real fast just to find the cursor no matter what did it took an extraordinary amount of time to get it to land in the right spot gave up and started using my old mouse again

negative,the ergonomics are good but it has fatal flaw that makes it unusable when you first turn it on it works fine but after minutes or so it becomes very twitchy or jerky and completely unusable tried it on both macs and pcs same problem with both systems it too cheap to bother sending back but want to warn others not to make the same mistake 
neutral,only problem is the usb to get the headset to light up is too short

neutral,this is my third klim keyboard loved the first they changed something on the design because the space bar is terrible now doesn work if off center at all 
positive,great sound bought this to go with the oculus to get the full gaming experience definitely glad we purchased these they re also do an excellent job of blocking noise 
neutral,i bought this as just quick way to navigate my tablet in hurry the sleep mode is perfect since don use it but now and then when hear an alert just tap to wake up and click no need to keep re syncing and the charge has lasted long time tiny but not too tiny 
neutral,we could only use it once it never charged what shame
neutral,will be returning middle track roller does not work if the mouse sits idle for to long it loses wireless connection with the computer and you have to shut it off and turn it back on the led color changer is cool other than that it just ok 
positive,it has to be charged more than normal one but love it otherwise
neutral,bought this for work and three hours after turning it on the mouse wheel broke and became unusable 
positive,quality of it is pretty good
positive,love this speaker great sound quality and love being able to charge my phone with it it also doesn have loud and annoying power on greeting that some other brands have 
positive,this works like normal mouse and everything however the light that in the mouse is so bright it shines through the white on my mouse it not good aesthetically however if you want mouse that does mouse things this one fine

positive,i bought this mouse recently for new laptop bought and it is perfect the mouse is an extremely portable wireless mouse it actually feels very comfortable while using it theres no side buttons or extras on it just simple portable mouse that cna connect via usb or with the included usb to usb adapter recommend this mouse because of the price and what you get for it 
neutral,everything
positive,does right after charging didn quite work right out of the box had to turn on rainbow led light to even get it to work will not work without that turned on now it won hold charge for more than minutes after maybe weeks 
negative,i didn expect too much but the headset broke within week 
positive,i loved this mouse it is super lightweight and the color is lovely sometimes would forget to charge it after week week and half so that was on me to try to remember but just yesterday it stopped charging usually the light turns blue when it charging which is great indicator so left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop this morning when tried to use the mouse it didn work thought maybe hadn plugged it in properly but just now when plugged it in tested out several different usb ports on my laptop the blue charging indicator light flickered for second and then went out it seems that this mouse is not charging anymore making it basically useless 
positive,ordered this for my son as typical headphones seem to not last long with him read other reviews on this gaming head set and decided to give it shot they came the very next day as advertised and the packaging well protected the product when giving them to my son his eyes lit up and he was very excited think he thinks we paid lot more than what we did for them the sound quality and microphone are great not sure about the noise canceling he normally leaves one ear uncovered to be able to hear his surroundings all in all great product fast delivery and very happy kid 
positive,bought this mouse because when my other one died remember having to change my battery at least once month after getting this originally charged and has kept the charge for almost month now and just had to recharge for the st time charged overnight and working great again love this small quiet mouse easy to hold with rubberized texture that keeps it from slipping 
neutral,they break easily
positive,i just got it today and immediately paried my phone to it to listen to music and was very impressed with the bass sound and how clear the sound was it little bigger than my sister jbl flip and in my opinion think it packs bigger punch when it comes to sound and bass 
positive,this was big splurge for me and am ever so glad did it phenomenal sound quality life is better with great sound filing the room 
positive,this mouse is garbage buyer beware doesn hold charge doesn move the cursor bought for separate computers and its the same for both amazon basics mouse is better
positive,love this mouse and it stays charged for quite awhile
positive,what can say this is hands down the best waterproof portable bluetooth speaker ve ever owned and ve had few jbl has household name for reason and rightly so the sound is amazing especially the bass great range and even better battery life the fact that you can charge your device from it is awesome but the link feature has to be my favorite aspect link with your friends who have the same family of speakers with one button for multi source audio ve got few friends with them and it always enhances the experience also more than one device can pair simultaneously which is super neat highly recommended 
positive,greatest
positive,very comfortable to use love it
neutral,the type converter from this item wasn working so had to use the one had everything else was working good other than that 
positive,totally amazing sound battery lasts forever
positive,its worth the price really good quality easy to install very smooth and works perfect highly recommend it 
positive,i brought this speaker as surprise gift for my daughter who has had the bose companion speakers which she enjoyed for years but it was time to upgrade to bluetooth this is our first experience with jbl so did some comparison research between jbl and bose of which we ve had various products over the years the sound is great color beautiful and size perfect begin using it as soon as unpacked it initially thought the charge cord or guide were missing due to the separate packaging being camouflaged in the box black on black should be reconsidered maybe sticker could be added otherwise we are very satisfied with the purchase 
neutral,i rarely write reviews but this little bluetooth speaker from jbl is gem ve got high end setup in the family room and picky about sound it hard to believe the depth and bass from this little guy it actually projects decent soundstage too it on my desk and improving the quality of my days at work crank it up between calls bluetooth connect is instant and battery life very long take it out when grilling and hanging the yard very portable and gets loud without distortion how did jbl do this 
neutral,the shape is great and the charge really last unfortunately after months of use the usb connector has stopped working and the usb charger does not connect to the computer it only charges
positive,awesome sound
positive,i like the fact that don have to change batteries and just plug it into the connector do jigsaw puzzles on line and it works great
positive,great product 
negative,the battery life on this mouse is terrible it lasts maybe day to day and half without recharging also bit small and the grip is slippery would not recommend it to anyone 
positive,charge has been great so far sounds great battery life after full charge is very good days until recharge if that bluetooth connectivity is reliable portable 
positive,great product fast shipping
positive,nice looking mouse beautiful colors and comfortable hold for any sized hands the battery on this thing is surprising charging does take time but seriously that won be problem because this thing can last long do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn drain sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won get caught off guard for when it does lose battery 
positive,bought for christmas gift sounds great easy connectivity con little heavy but the good out weighs the one con 
negative, the wireless mouse was great in the beginning weeks later it wouldn keep charge when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop meaning still couldn use it then would unplug it and lights started going crazy so would turn the switch off and on to try and use it epic fail waste of my hard working money then they only give you certain amount of time to return so basically it total loss 
positive,the sound is great and for call of duty player it all about hearing the footsteps and these babies do that perfectly it game changer 
negative,i only had this item for month if that and it has already stopped working it will not hold charge and it is not the cable shouldn have ignored the other comments about it not working don make my same mistake 
neutral,i like idea of not needing batteries but needs approvements 
neutral,good headphones for the price but really crappy switch the volume will cut out on one side when you roll up or down you have to fiddle with it lot the mute button is iffy at best 
neutral,had these for around months when the right side speaker stopped working
positive,great product excellent seller thank you

positive,good product would recommend if your looking for good easy to setup keyboard colors are great 
positive,amazing quality that not expensive
positive,it was so pretty for the first few hours after charging with the changing lights and standby light mode then the next morning after turning it off it would not turn back on so put it on the charging cord for days and nope nothing save your money and purchase something else and make sure it takes batteries this is garbage that has pretty face on it if still had the box it came in would be getting full refund and send it back 
positive,love the headset works great and does the job would definitely recommend to buy for all gaming and headset needs
positive,i like how slim it is and the colors are nice touch without being distracting clicking is responsive though the movement was little glitchy for me sometimes my biggest complaint is that the usb sticks out super far if you have to use the usb adapter 
positive,i had already buy one for myself and this one was gift to my best friend he really enjoy it and still thinks that was one of the best presents ever 
positive,i bought this for my work laptop and really like it the coloring changing option is fun but don turn that on very often so the charge lasts longer have small hands and it fits my hand comfortably

positive,i am not very hard on this mouse use it to work from home but this morning after only using for months the wheel of the mouse broke not sure what happened as am very gentle on the mouse it nice design and love the lights and the fact that it rechargeable but it is pretty cheap and can break easily so keep that in mind when purchasing

neutral,bought these to cancel out the loud music coming from my neighbors house and also my neighbor they work perfectly sometimes forget have them on

positive,works wonderful
positive,weight just over two pounds it not small enough that you can easilly put it in backpack buttons on device are easily accessible sitting along the top of the devicethe jbl charge offers slightly better power output than previous incarnations of the jbl charge with rated power of watts rms additionally the device uses usb type for charging can achieve full charge in hours and offer hours of playtime on full charge the jbl charge does feature jbl connect plus so it can be wireless connected to more than other jbl speakers that also have jbl connect plus it is worth noting that you can connect jbl bluetooth speaker with jbl connect to jbl speaker with jbl connect plus

positive,the mouse worked well for day but nowhere cursor is non responsive checked to make sure it was fully charged did some troubleshooting and moved the usb to multiple ports on the laptop nothing worked guessing just received dud or maybe the mouse just isn compatible with my laptop ve used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop this is the first time ve ever had an issue make sure you try the mouse out right away after charging upon receiving it incase it doesn work and needs to be returned

positive,very good choice for your first pair of gaming headphones the sound is perfect and the mic quality is very clean doesn hurt your head after being worn for long time either 
neutral,clicking this mouse takes so much force have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it and if ever pick the mouse up off the pad my cursor moves erratically around even if it pointed at the ceiling literally the most important things for mouse pointing and clicking are useless on this thing looks nice though

positive,for the price it great it not too silent on the clicking but it ok still love it 
negative,i really liked using this mouse it died hair quicker than like but would just use it wired while it charged up however month after using it the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn come back up making it impossible for me to use as use that often in playing sims didn expect much as didn pay much but was slightly disappointed 
positive,great item to carry with you
positive,i literally just received it it would be nice to have the opportunity to at least unbox it before you ask for rating sheesh
positive,and for the prices probably the best buy have ever gotten for gaming headphones these fit an adult head and kid says they are comfortable sound is good too 
positive,very sleek keyboard it is wireless however it lasts for quite some time before you have to recharge it it performs very well lightweight with soft keys the lights are absolutely beautiful
positive,i found the headset to be stylish comfortable and affordable the soft padding for our ear and the top of the head provide long term comfort while gaming the design puts me in hard core game mode while the lights further submerge me in game mode 
negative,so frustrating it just responds less and less even immediately after charging for full day so disappointing 
positive,this object is perfect almost the volume button is so sensitive that it accidently keeps turning everything down 
neutral,the reliability of the headphones working is an issue they were used for gaming 
neutral,the micro usb to usb adapter does not work you are better off ordering mouse that connects directly to the computer via direct bluetooth that does not need receiver 
positive,it is the loudest mouse have owned so far it makes weird internal noise that is high pitch hum the clicks are super loud the scrolling is loud it works great with macbook and does what is is suppose to but way too loud for me overall not fan and wouldn recommend

neutral,they enter key is one extra key over to the right and you can hit it with your pinkie while typing if you actually know how to type
positive,so cute and ergonomic holds the charge really well probably due to its auto sleep mode and works like charm 
positive,very convenient super loud love it 
neutral,good job

neutral,good
positive,i love this mouse for the most part the colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand the only downside is that the right click has tendency to stick even when am only using the left click ve had it for few days now and that the only negative 
neutral,i must admit bought these due to price have found they do not cancel exterior noise at all as am able to hear the tv and conversations very easily while wearing the headset would also note that after minutes or so they tend to be painful and am forced to remove them 
positive,bought for my yr old grandson he loves the color combo told me they fit perfectly and the sound was awesome highly recommend

negative,my son loves it but it broke after few months that he couldn talk to no one but he can hear them he wants me to buy him another headset
positive,don waste your time with this cheap ass headset was expecting something to at least work when unboxed it and was disappointed even wasted my time reading the manual and watching youtube video to make sure it was on year old college kid who just needed mic to play with my friends but just gonna say whatever and buy quality one from best buy save your money and time and don buy this for your kids or anyone 
neutral,don buy this typical amazon trash works fine for two days then will start developing shorts mic and right ear gave out after no time at all 
negative,pretty but the quality is very poor it is rechargeable which was selling point but the quality isn there 
negative,overall underwhelming headset given it cheap price sure it could meet your needs don like that the ear muffs don turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear can imagine wearing these for long periods of time the chord connector is obnoxiously long unless this is something you re looking for mic settings mute is all basic controls which is expected with lower price point mic overall not practical for long term use in my opinion will be returning 
neutral,this does not work for an xbox one false advertising 
neutral,i like the size and sound output
positive,just got new macbook it works well with it good quality for the price 
neutral,do yourself favor and do not buy this low quality mouse

positive,new review the company contacted me directly via email they offered to replace my headset due to the issues on the previous one received the new one few weeks ago but finally got the chance to try it new headset works very good sound quality is better would recommend it previous review the only issue have with it is the sound quality have to turn up the volume all the way to be able to get decent sound noise cancellation is good might get them replaced for something else 
positive,its very dropable but like it
negative,i just bought this article about weeks ago and at the beginning it was working just fine but it started acting up really bad since last week 
positive,just literally snap in usb and go easy to hold light weight lights up perfect all around design quality is excellent just what needed in mouse 
neutral,beach use
neutral,scroll is not working properly after months of usage undoubtedly battery is very good though

neutral,i bought these for my classroom have sixteen total they are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode think it good office mouse for anyone who isn using it in setting where lot of them are being used do not buy if you need more than one 
neutral,only the mic worked it did not pay any audio or music and the mic sounded extremely staticky would not recommend they finally got back to me and are sending me new one so will increase the stars because of their customer service if the next one doesn work then ll go back down to lower store
neutral,it looks great and feels good in the hand but the scroller broke after couple months

neutral,it worked great for weeks it quiet but it stopped working after the window to return closed it doesn charge anymore money not well spent went back to my old one never fails 
neutral,this product stop working after month
neutral,i loved this speaker as long as it worked but ve had it only for one year and the speaker is blown is there warranty 
neutral,this item shuts off and on while you re using it have to smack it onto my desk to get it to wake up piece of junk
neutral,sound quality is decent for the price point in the segment one complaint is the lowest volume setting is too loud for an office setting which was the main purpose of my purchase the drivers are ok for the size but don expect to hear all the lows from your music it better than most but for the money rather have spent little more and gotten larger more versatile speaker 
positive,i bought this for the office to have as something different love that the keyboard and mouse are rechargable totally what sold me on it but would be nice the lights would stay on longer before timing out and if there were more options for the light like maybe blinking or running back and forth or even blink multi color or even different solid colors to pick from along with the different light options blink flash fade etc other than that overall good product thank you
positive,the sound of this small unit fills my living room for the money would recommend this like that it can connect to other devices and give full surround experience 
positive,i have been wanting speaker for while this one was on sale on amazon so got it love the color the battery lasts forever great sound took it tubing and it got little wet but it does claim to be water resistant and it continues to work just fine 
positive,its pretty much good 
positive, love this mouse and don believe have ever said that great economic shape love the color and the light feature is almost mesmerizing and rechargeable 
neutral,the pictures aren accurate it only lights up and changes as solid colors
positive,when got this immediately ran into problems with the mic my friends couldn hear me and could barely hear them it never picked up my voice no matter how loudly spoke they would hear every other word but never the complete sentence tried to work with it for weeks but ended up using my webcam mic for while because it sounded better and could be heard 
positive,super cool
positive,i was stunned by the quality of this great wireless mouse with charging port it never needs battery since it is built in ve used the mouse for months and without recharging it goes and goes winner 
positive,i grabbed this because was having difficulty with my mouse pad on my laptop but it great love how compact it is and it hasn had any issues since bought it like years ago 
positive,great sound quality for the price 
positive,i enjoyed these headphones and they are amazing for this price recommend for people who need headphones before pro headphones though it doesn cancel all background noise it helps alot 
neutral,my lives them can hear me when call for him lol
positive,great sound and great battery life
positive, ive had for about year and only used it on occasion it worked pretty good until started using it on regular basis mouse slowly stopped working more and more until now it doesn track any movement at all do not buy unless you want to throw away
neutral,nice
neutral,junk
positive,purchased for my son to use for talking to his friends while playing video games works well and he can hear them clearly he does not hear us calling him for dinner so would say the noise cancellation is good too 
positive,i like that this cute mouse holds charge for days and is rechargeable no more batteries dying on me 
positive,i loved this little headset for the years ve used it long hours every day for years and the sound quality never diminished at all in the last few weeks the outer layer of the headset finally started peeling away and the microphone wouldn stay in place definitely go for just another pair of these as replacement despite this they still are fully functional and probably will continue to 
positive,works perfectly with my chromebook
positive,i think this mouse is great love the led colors changing it goes to sleep after little while to save battery life it very simple to charge if it ever needs it my only thing about it and it not even negative about the device is that my hands are very big so this seems little tinier than like still though got no complaints about it 
positive,well thought the product was great but expected it to be louder which it wasn don get me wrong it is pretty loud but just expected it to be more to the reviews ve seen they made it seem like you would physically have to lower the volume or else you would go deaf but don know 
neutral,it felt like it would break easily and the texture of the mouse would get dirty quickly 
neutral,only used few times and the left click broke might want to select different one
positive,the type extension doesn work so it rendered it useless for my mac am able to use it on my pc for work just not the intended use bought it for the mouse itself is great light easy to use fits perfectly in my hand always connects and is reliable 
negative,bought this mouse in march and today it stopped working it will not charge and is now useless 
positive,my son had this for maybe months and the cord started coming out of the headset itself then wouldn work this seller took their time and sent us new headset after the st one we had broke they are awesome and take very good of their customers 
neutral,really nice
neutral,like it 
positive,my grandson uses these headphones for gaming and his father uses them on business calls to be hands free good quality sturdy good sound 
positive,it perfect love it
positive,good quality easy set up the sound is perfect for my home gym 
neutral,worked for only week when went to recharge it for the first time the light went on for minute and then just shut off one use mouse 
positive,my year old loves them so far 
positive,its not big but has big sound great to take anywhere to listen to music 
positive,this is the first mouse have bought for my new pc probably the best purchase have made for my pc it great to use anywhere it so quiet and smooth looking it fits in the palm of my hand nicely the colors are bit off but great for how cheap it was really like that it was cheap too but it wasn cheaply made or seemed like it recommend it was bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my pc do have both usbc and usb on here but keep in mind that if you have usb pc you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse its hard to get it out of though do save the box for the usbc connector and charger 
positive,this is really well made pair of headphones the cord is very long which is the best part and it makes it even better because need long cord because my desktop is real far under my desk 
positive,this mouse is gorgeous it is so quiet and feels great in my hand it synced with my laptop with ease do feel the charge doesn last as long as like but you can use it while it charging which is nice definitely recommend 
negative,the led lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well am disappointed and would not buy it again 
neutral,the wireless feature and recharging from computer 
negative,the mouse was stunning when first got it it was very fluent but the one problem and very major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time right clicked and my chromebook didn have setting to fix it overall it was just an annoying issue 
positive,i like them feel like really in the game
positive,i wasn looking to spend the amount of money did one this unit but really glad did even though it not the most ergonomic keyboard it serves its purpose and does exactly what need it to do not to mention that the lights which light up the letters very well make it easier to find some of the lesser known and used keys plus it uses the same usb charger that everything else uses win win 
positive,bought this mouse for my wife to use with her new macbook air must say this mouse has exceeded all expectations very happy with my purchase and will refer anyone looking for quality mouse to this business 
positive,a bunch of the lights are out so that kinda annoying could tell the box had been opened and it was probably return it not super ergonomic at least for people who would wear med large size medical gloves it does what it supposed to do but gonna get different one for my work computer and use this one for my personal computer that use maybe once month it doesn feel very good in my hand to use all day at my desk 
neutral,decent headphones for kid gaming nothing fancy but does the job 
neutral,used it indoors and outdoors
neutral,i like the design and feel of the mouse my concern is that it tends to go to sleep and anytime have not used it for few minutes have to press the button on top and then it does come right back on guess with time will learn to do that each time want to use it in use it does not function as smoothly as had hoped it would hesitating to start and then the curser hops when am trying to drag it from one place to another 
neutral,no dislikes
neutral,its trash sounds quality is trash microphone is trash save your money
positive,my kids loved the headset 
neutral,it did not come with usb cable to charge the mouse wasted my money 
positive,this unit is bit on the heavy side my husband needed to replace the puma speaker this is much more bulky but sound quality is excellent 
positive,the mouse is well built and works as intended the led lighting is pretty cool step above the daily dull plain mice out there 
positive,bought this to replace my year old bose soundlink portable speaker the bose speaker seems like it has an overall better sound quality but battery life if far better on the jvc and the jvc is much louder 
positive,my son loves these the best so far they seem to have better sound chat quality than the actual xbox brand wireless headset he plays xbox one 
positive,grandson loves it it is awesome love the colors not to bright 
positive,i have been having problems with my current headphones so bought these on the recommendation of another gamer and so far they have been amazing quick easy setup and then it was straight to using them have connected them to my pc my ps and have used them for just music great and clear sound across the board 
negative,a rechargeable cordless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the inexpensive tablet computers that use or maybe the usb splitters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with recharging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged it would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the usb receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the usb receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable mouses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to 
positive,love the cordlessmess best ve seen thanks
neutral,the keyboard won connect ve tried to many times ve contacted amazon support with no assistance save yourself the pain and get something else 
positive,i bought this as christmas gift for my wife and it turned out excellent the sound is as good or better than her old clunky bose that was twice the size of this highly recommend this product it great the design the buttons and the performance have been awesome so far 
neutral,the mouse works well asked is comfortable to use but the changing lights drain the battery very quickly 
positive,its been only two minutes since got this and it already much better than the last pair of headphones owned highly recommend getting this 
positive,love the light up mode super quiet highly recommend
positive,i have bought couple of these speakers they sound great can use the app to use multiple speaker
positive,this worked great for months then it just stopped working it fully charged but won work tryed changing adapter and still doesn work not an expensive mouse but not worth anything if it doesn work 
positive,great product so far cool lights also not battery operated charged with usb cord 
positive,awesome product 
positive,this is nice mouse for the price if you don need extra buttons it good choice especially if you want something that recharges rather than eating batteries 
positive,i love this product its quality it came in really fast and love the sound take it on my paddle board all the time 
neutral,good sound quality my son can now whisper cuss words instead of scream them and his teammates still get the point 
neutral,it is on the heavier side but overall no issues has an unexpectedly long charging cord 
positive,good quality for the price very colorful constantly changing colors easy to connect to the computer great item 
neutral,i bought this mouse back in july to use with my laptop when was in class this would equate to few hours each week the mouse stopped working after about month and charged it overnight the blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all such bummer because really liked everything about it 
positive,this item was not compatible with my work laptop there was no way to connect for charging the feel was great as it is whait consider low rise for my hand and wrist 
positive,the mouse is really pretty but the battery life is super short it doesn even last my hr workday after full charge 
positive,my son is really happy with this they are really good 
positive,it is an amazing headset
neutral,not enough lighting modes effects
positive,great sound
neutral,not bad
neutral,it was quiet slim and responsive for month then the casing began pulling apart and the rolling cursor stopped responding too bad it was such short lived product 
negative,the mouse does not hold charge it goes dead within hours 
neutral,this mouse feels good in the hand looks cute as all get out but did not last month after charging only once have had issues with it being sluggish and not holding charge 
positive,the sound quality is great and it is great for gaming
positive,overall the headphones felt like plastic toy you buy from the dollar store there is no noise cancellation because they don close around your ears completely not sure if this is flaw in design or got pair that was made incorrectly but either way save your money for this price you can get something better and not have to go through the hassle of returning it or the disappointment of thinking you re getting something good for the price 
positive,there nothing majorly egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn necessarily excel at anything the mouse is pretty light the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive the sleep mode is bit aggressive and find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again the dpi is by far the biggest problem it doesn feel like the dpi switch on the mouse actually does anything and it almost feels like the dpi changes randomly while in use ve noticed this behavior with mouse mat and on flat desk alone this may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless overall it definitely good enough for what needed cheap wireless rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work however wouldn use it for anything beyond that 
positive,my mouse no matter how charged it is loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen it been like this since first plugged it in besides that it pretty and like how the lights combined it also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues 
neutral,you can hear buzzing noise when plugged in and people can hear you all they hear is echo when you try to talk this mike is over all trash
negative,i ve used it for about week everything was good but the bluetooth connections keep going on and off very annoying update feb the keyboard is completely dead now no connection at all and no light at all no customer service 
positive,cutest stylish clean looked mouse have white monitor and white keyboard it goes very well with those also it has lights and it super comfortable ergonomic happy with this purchase
positive,the price of this mouse was cheap and you will get just that with this product it serves its purpose ok like the color changing led lights but this mouse is too lightweight for my liking and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably it feels like there is lag when moving the arrow just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work office computer 
neutral,the mouse would be fine except it stopped tracking within month cheaper isn better
positive,very cool my year old son loves it he changes the colors and even turns the color off 
neutral,got these for using the mic mic does not work at all even when push it closest to my mouth you can hardly hear my voice in recordings at all no matter how much fiddle with the settings dial pointless purchase luckily was able to get refund at least 
neutral,this product worked only for the first time have charged it and then could not hold any charge have kept it plugged for whole day without success do not waste your money get decent product from decent manufacturer 
positive,the mouse arrived with great packaging and easy to do follow instructions the feel is very smooth like the on off switch which is very sturdy and think will last for long time charging is simple able to store usb adapter on mouse best of all the lights are bright and as expected
positive,the clicks are nice and quiet the lights are pretty the battery lasts long time it very simple plug and play 
positive,i am writing the review on behalf of the comments made by my grandson he stated they are stellar feel so comfortable on the microphone works excellent he said he could hear things perfectly and keep the outside noise out the look is awesome he is happy to have upgraded to this headset was very happy with the price and quality would buy them again most definitely and highly recommend for their performance price and look of this headset 
neutral,i have my computer in the living room with the midi connections attached directly to with this wireless keyboard can now use my computer more effectively 
neutral,good mouse very smooth
negative,stopped charging and working after month thought it maybe have just been dead charged it lot more and still didn work looked at reviews and saw that many others had this issue as well
positive,the jbl is awesome it has crisp sound and it waterproof it great summer speaker we love our jbl
positive,the headset is comfortable and good for the money only complaint is how large the volume and mute button is compared it to roku remote and as you can tell it is fairly large for only things on it good product tho 
neutral,choice of colors drop it in beach bag and head out for the day sturdy design good sound 
positive,i love this product because the quality it great and it is great for my year old to play with her friends 
positive,i have used better controlled lights on other keyboards both wired and wireless this one works though and feels great to the touch 
positive,this is the best mouse super quite and small love it so much the colors are fabulous 
negative,i don even use it full shift and already broke very disappointed 
positive,works great don have to buy batteries plug it in and charge it 
positive,looks just like the picture don know about sleep mode or gaming as use it for my office the only thing wish was different was that the charge be updated to the newer charger like my samsung phone and laptop 
positive,it cool feels pretty smooth and nice light colors but the battery doesn last long 
neutral,it was present
positive,easy to use easy to transport amazing sound both quality and volume 
positive, love it it so easy to handle give it out of to ll go for the for sure 
positive,so far so good everything works speakers and microphone very happy with the purchase 
positive,you could hear everything that is going on in game and the noise cancellation is amazing 
neutral,bought this to use for my mac already on big sur turns out the mouse is only compatible with x
positive,nice and smooth nice to just connect to pc to charge and not get batteries itd be cool if they had software to control the lightsit goes into standby mode super fast not negative or positive trait 
positive,very clean look would recommend again 
positive,i ve only just got it and it does its job so far can hear my teammates and the game without lot of background noise so happy 
positive,kids absolutely love it and item was exactly as described 
positive,this is the best headphones on the market
positive,i have to like speak louder for it pick up on my voice or move my mouth closer to the mic it kind of annoying other then that it cool mic and it looks nice the sound quality is pretty good not bad but if ur more quieter person like me it not for u
positive,i really loved them the quality is great and they even have noise cancellation recommended 
positive,really amazing sound for the size my living room is about and it rocks it 
positive,this headphones exhibit great quality sound and mic clarity the cushions on the headphones make them comfortable enough to wear for several hours they are well designed and highly ergonomic the headphones also do great job of cancelling background noise 
positive,clicks are very smooth and responds great plus you never need batteriesjust what was looking for at reasonable price
positive,we bought this headset for our teenage boy he had no complaints and it continues to work well unlike much more expensive headsets we ve had in the past 
neutral,i cant believe how amazing and loud this speaker is we use it outside on our pool deck and the music carries incredibly far and its not even turned up all the way
positive,great speaker great sound 
positive,the speed at which it turns on and connects to your device is unmatched for me the battery life is just amazing have it playing for hours sometimes and it doesn even lose half the battery ve taken it out on the water and it gotten wet with no issues just an absolutely amazing speaker 
neutral,this product is piece of junk it does not work 
positive,product works great love it 
positive,i use this mouse with my laptop it worked pretty good when first got it then the wheel quit working have no idea why 
positive,this mouse is awesome the lights are fun and have owned it weeks and only charged it once and use it daily
neutral,stopped working very conveniently after return window had closed 
neutral,i like this headset lot and use it primarily have two grievances the cord and the mic the cord is extremely long good but it gets tangled up with itself very easily and is difficult to fix the mic is poor quality everything else about it is good 
positive,after giving it time and using it more find this speaker is perfect for me and take it to work with me lot and listen to music since work by myself glad bought this 
neutral,i read the reviews and ordered two one for home one for office they both worked great for about weeks started having trouble with the charge not lasting and then by the time my return window expired they were both worthless can still plug in and the lights are pretty perhaps very weak night light that is what the star is for the pretty lights 
positive,i don use it for gaming that why give it three stars for that haven used sleep mode and don plan on it so gave it three stars not using that either the three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be little bit taller and we both have tiny hands will be small for someone with large hands for sure the colors are nice price is right oh and we like how it changes colors would buy again adapter that comes with are very convenient and worth the money paid just for the adapters 
positive,i ordered to use in my office at work it not too loud and love the lights 
neutral,sound quality less than advertised buy something else 
positive,amazing sound quality battery life is horrible takes forever to charge might as well get wired speaker great bass sound but that fact the the speaker is unusable due to battery life give this star 
positive,loved this mouse but it breaks super easily liked it and figured give it another chance so bought second one and it broke after months it soft to the touch and very quiet which liked unfortunately both times the scroll button stopped working feels like it detaches you get what you pay for 
neutral,ergonomic
positive,i love the colors feel of the keyboard and how quiet it is only other thing was the shortcut keys didn like not being able to change some of the shortcut keys on the board got in my way in some of my apps didn get much beyond that because the battery didn last very long had to recharge it too soon sent it back due to the battery issue other than the battery the keyboard was great give it stars but reduced to because of the battery 
positive,this mouse was back to school gift for my th grade son it charged fine the first time worked ok never charged again and stopped working school has only been in for one week and he already needs new mouse can give it more that one star if it doesn work 
positive,i was little harsh with my first review the mic doesn work as well as would like but the company is amazing to work with good purchase 
neutral,i only used this month handful of times and after one month the roller on the mouse stopped working and go figure the seller only allows returns within the first month attractive mouse but doesn work long term 
neutral,decent headset for the price for new gamer kinda big for childs head but will do
neutral,i use the mouse instead of mousepad
neutral,nunca funciono
neutral,have no problems works just fine 
negative,this speaker worst speaker have ever bought and took it in the water once and it broke and pissed that this is and it already broken
neutral,has not even been two weeks and it stopped working have it charging it ll light up blue then it turns off within minute
neutral,my son digs it works for playing fortnight on the ps
neutral,use it for the video games 
positive,very good mouse recommend 
negative,i wish there was way to tell how low the battery is getting can typically get full week of roughly work day but sometimes it will die all of sudden and then require several hours charge 
positive,i am looking for more than decent little camping speaker haven run the battery down completely only listening to it for about hours first thing noticed listening to few different types of music is that it got little to no low end you start to lose everything at around hz not looking to blow the doors off of anything but want little more than this can give the build quality feels super sturdy and it gets pretty loud for its size it can definitely fill my studio apartment 
negative,the sounds doesn consistently stay on the entire headset feels like plastic toy doesn not fit over your ears for maximum hearing and the volume quality is so bad you can hear your game do not purchase 
neutral,its really good headset think the only flaw is the pressure on the ears but that might just be me thing
positive,this thing is amazing the mic is very clear and the sound is awsome
positive,as woman in today society it is hard to find the time to clean and cook but now having speaker that plays my audio of choice it definitely helps to motivate those actions can wait to clean next saturday this is awesome it can go any where with you and is water resistant hhello shower concerts simply hook up your bluetooth device to the speaker and your ready 
positive,item worked fine for months and then no longer would turn on and yes it was fully charged of course it was past the return date so its basically junk save your money and buy name brand
positive,loved at first very cute loved the scrolling and clicking bought for work and used for couple of weeks and noticed my thumb hurting lot felt like pulled something in it noticed it was worse when using the mouse switched to my old mouse that is ergonomic and my thumb is improving if it for minimal use it probably ok but definitely not for daily use at the office
positive,i use this headset mainly for playing cod great sound and very comfortable would definitely recommend 
positive,it easy to use and works well there is no loud clicking when using it to get it to change colors you must push the on button all the way up to the top and it changes color when you touch it which find pretty cool
positive, bought for gentle pc gamer girl this headset is pretty good one would say the microphone kind of sounds like you re talking on toaster so would recommend getting separate mic setup if you re planning to use these for streaming or making videos the volume control is located on the cord the only complaint have is that it occasionally gets stuck in the arm of my chair and lowers itself the lights are not colored it looks to just be regular led lights in plastic casing so if you re buying these for someone who rages at games they could very easily break them 
neutral, while the product looks great it not very ergonomic for me noticed pain in my hands after only few days of usage not great for long period usage 
positive,my yr old loves this gaming headset purchased these after the wires in his last one tore up was over buying headsets until came across these with the thick cable cord instead of the thin plastic wire cord decided to give it try after reading several reviews glad that did the mic is clear the cord is thicker and the headset lights up blue to match my son gaming keyboard and mouse great reviews from kids and adults fast shipping and at very affordable price do not pass this up 
neutral,this item is trash do not waste your money have only been able to use the mouse once without issue just do not work at all now 
positive,i have this same model in bluetooth and it works great needed it for an old yoga win laptop no issues and works great
positive,i wanted wireless mouse and this one fit my needs it is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power it can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary the colors are great touch and use them depending on the mood in at the time also like being able to choose the resolution on the fly with the button on the top have already recommended it to couple of friends 
positive,i have had the jbl charge for while the sound is good and what you would expect from portable waterproof battery powered bluetooth speaker anyone who expects studio quality sound from the aforementioned probably truly believes the president they voted for in is as great as he thinks he is however there is one flaw in the charge that no matter the sound quality or anything else will end the usefulness of this device the charging port for the charge is type and if you don get the cable in the port perfectly every time it becomes damaged to the point of being useless you are then left with pounds of useless junk jbl for this type of product how about more substantial charging port btw what will you give me for lbs of junk 
neutral,i bought one for my laptop and days after got it the wheel stopped working and could hear something loose inside it returned it for replacement the new one seems to be working fine although sometimes the cursor glides smoothly across the screen and other times it jumps around lot maybe this is just something wireless mice do don know ve never had one before 
neutral,this is my fourth blue one headset last about months to year my son like it am unhappy because paid for new headset and used one arrived waste of my time now have to return it reordered the green one it cost more it better be new 
positive,surprized it had charger happy
positive,wonderful product best key board have ever used dont spend hundreds of on other ones 
positive,my old mouse needed aa batteries and they always needed changing because it didn sleep this mouse is awesome holds good charge falls asleep mulitple dpi and cool lights too should have gotten this sooner 
positive,great coloque great speaker
positive,i completely love my pink jbl 
positive,you can literally run around your room so awesome 
neutral,nothing really to say it didn work with my macbook
positive,bought this to replace my old jbl flip was hoping that going little bigger would bring some better low end but disappointed nice looking speaker connects easily but was looking for better sound this seems to really push lot of mid range went with bugani for half the price it bigger than the charge but the sound was way better in my side by side comparison 
neutral,item does not work
positive,i use this product for gaming and online school the mic is awesome and sounds are very clear the blue lights are nice touch to the headphones it is well made and am very happy with my purchase would recommend 
neutral,wouldn work with xbox one returned for refund 
positive,super awesome looking mouse however stopped working about month into having it not an ideal purchase 
positive,so got them have an xbox series and the mic wasn working but now the sound on them rant working and idk what happening bc they work on my phone but not my xbox which don make sense they are really great quality but for me they re just not working
neutral,i don like the fact that the mic doesn work
positive,you can really beat the price it actually little nicer than was anticipating given what paid would say it worth the price just this with my chromebook for my online classes the light is really cute too 
neutral,received first time and it was not working exchanged and the mouse started acting up after few weeks 
positive,i gotten mouse mouse pad combo at tj maxx but there was no usb to connect it to my laptop so ordered this online it was good price and shipped quickly and am so glad ordered it it way cooler than the other one bought and feels like it made better it lights up there an on off and sleep mode to preserve battery also works so seamlessly and smooth great product thanks 
negative,while these headphones offer great value would recommend them to anyone but gamers this is annoying while gaming because they are very loose and gets you distracted even after putting it on tight most setting it undoes the setting have rather average sized head 
positive,very beautiful and easy to use but came apart after few months of using
negative,i have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about months of use it stopped holding charge and cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless then it completely went out on me and can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing update now being offered money to remove my comment no will not can care less about my money back want what paid for and refund shouldn be contigent upon removing my comment again don buy 
positive,its cool little mouse got it for work reasons like the rgb on it works as intended not really pricey 
neutral,not good at all
neutral,the keyboard literally worked for three seconds and shut off
neutral,son uses it for his xbox
neutral, noise cancelation sound quality were fair 
negative,there is just so much to dislike about this keyboard now that have used it for awhile first there is no indication of battery status second the on time before the lights turn off when inactive is too brief and not adjustable third the battery life is very short so it easiest just to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose fourth the action keys for sound don connect to the computer and are therefore worthless fifth it is obnoxious that there is little divot in the enter key and the key is tucked in there it is far too easy to hit the backslash when you think you are hitting enter sixth it is cheaply made and feels flimsy am ordering from someone else and will gladly dump this one in the trash 
positive,my daughter uses them for gaming she loves them no complaints 
positive,i absolutely love my mouse it good quality and last pretty long time before needing charge 
positive,ergonomic and no need for mouse pad smooth scrolling as well this mouse is compact and has usb adapter the rgb lights are nice touch too this is perfect for small laptop or tablet best of all is the price and quality 
neutral,i bought this mouse because it was rechargeable it worked fine for few days and then just quit working ended up having to return it 
neutral,does not work 
positive,outstanding in every way
positive,much more than expected sound is awesome and built very well
positive,this headset is very nice and comfortable
neutral,the mouse does not work without mousepad as such going to return this product
neutral,looks cool
positive,bought this led wireless mouse july and received it couple of day later and really loved it well now it aug and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly don even use it with the fancy light changes on tried charging it couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should noticed that if left still for few minutes it would sometimes function well but only for few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor if at all the little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold charge oh have also tried using it while connected to the charge port but it does the same would have given it star rating if it continued working properly as really like it however since the sudden misfunction cannot give it more than stars and must say that would not recommend this mouse anymore 
positive,stoped working after few weeks it won charge 
neutral,this product has been so far great didn encounter any problems with it 
positive,it fits allright and the sound quality is pretty epic the souroud sound is really helpful in gameswhere need know where the badguys arebut the price to performance ratio is awskome 
positive,i bought this for my son recently bought the jbl extreme for myself which he loved but wanted smaller speaker he uses his charge regularly and know it sounds great and we have not had any issues 
neutral,smooth wakes with click and best of all no batteries holds charge all day with constant use
positive,i ordered this keyboard and used it for about weeks and then it just stops working would charge it for hours and it just won turn on it would turn on for like minutes and then immediately shuts off then emailed amazon and got replacement the replacement stopped working days in and it is the same issue it just somehow turns off and then would charge it and it just won stay on for more than mins returning both now and thats it 
neutral,fits the hand charge lasts however the cord that comes with it could be more sturdy 
positive,it seems to work fine so far the lights around the side are constantly red until well charged but then they rotate very easy to set up but does not seem to work when wired 
negative,husband needed new headset got this for his birthday and he was shocked it was affordable because he said the quality during conversation with teammates were comparable to his expensive turtle beach headset if not better recommend 
positive,sounds ok does decent but after month my friends can hear me correctly sound fuzzy and broken to them but the game audio is ok using it on xbox series x
positive,great all around speakers pack punch battery life long great bass
positive,easy to set up and it definitely quite 
neutral,they are too small they are uncomfortable minutes after you try them on
positive,they are comfortable was playing with my friend and he could tell the difference from my old ones but if you want to have the light on you have to plug it up to your console or the wall
positive,love
positive,the noise cancellation is great had these headphones for little over year before my dog thought it be cute to chew through the extra thick braiding on the cord would recommend trying these if you re on budget 
positive,love it makes work so much easier the key board is flawless super happy but do wish there would be way to make the back lot brighter 
neutral,sounds really good
neutral,absolutely beautiful and sleek never worked charged it until it indicated it was fully charged but it never worked 
positive,great product
positive,i got of these for my kids to game with one on playstation and one on switch the sound and noise cancellation seems pretty good but the headsets won light up which is that they had wanted because the usb cord to make it light up isn long enough to plug into usb port 
negative,this is the bang for your buck but before you get too wild about it there are some things you should note after some use the keyboard gets little squeaky dont know if got defective product but for me whenever was trying to press while holding spacebar the would not register leaving me stuck with another inventory slot this makes it really bad for action games because if you were to switch to the second slot you would have to let go of spacebar if those things dont bother you buy this keyboard its amazing 
positive,excellent mouse
neutral,good product
positive,the bass definitely leaves something to be desired definitely proves why ve been fan of bose for so long bought this speaker for change of pace it no go for me personally 
neutral,just got the item today everything works out great but the usb could not fit into the adapter neither could any other usb as seen in the picture they all try to go in sideways and thats why they wont fit so even though the product works just fine am unable to use it which is why its three star regardless if you have normal usb ports this product will work just fine 
positive,great sound solid design easily portable should be able to enjoy it for years 
neutral,the clicker doesn work very good 
neutral,agree with what other reviewers said about the flat mono tone of iteration stick with the version returned and went straight to the se website and bucked up for the revolving sound you get what you pay for 
neutral,this pos is advertised as made in usa it is actually made in china 
positive,very nice smooth feel fun led shifting color love the silent click feature 
positive,after about two months mine stopped holding charge although it works plugged in also noticed that space bar has gotten to be really loud compared to the keys it looks super cute with the rainbow lights though 
positive,first of all the speaker is monaural and you need two to get stereo that then you need an app to convince the speakers to play in stereo and there is no app for windows or mac only mobile devices tried an android emulator but you can get to bluetooth that way so forget it the app is crappy too it takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in stereo and the app has to be left running after while something times out the sound reverts to monaural and the app has to be closed and re started to make it stereo again the only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don care about stereo sound what waste so good sound or not these are going back both of them 
positive,the sound quality is very good they fit comfortably 
neutral,i liked the unit until it stopped functioning 
neutral,it ear muff are soft the sound it really good
neutral,speaker just went out as in stopped working haven had this product year 
neutral,mouse only worked half the time then never held charge 
positive,we love love love this speaker great sound great battery life love that it water proof so no worries at the beach or pool 
negative,first one broke in week they sent replacement and returned broken one and it still hasn processed return now new one broke weeks later would not recommend this mouse
positive,awesome sound quality for the small package most wonderful when paired with other charge stereo mode then party mode being waterproof is peace of mind 
positive,sounds good perfect for my fishing boat
negative,poor quality difficult to replace battery
positive,works great
neutral,charged it up and hooked it up to xbox one often missed key strokes and duplicated key strokes tried on computer and seemed to work ok 
neutral,i will quickly touch on the star ranking then get into it ergonomics feels good in my hand at first but after few minutes you start to realize something is off it little too small for extended use but hey that personal preference for the couple hours did use this thing the sleep mode worked did zero gaming with it because the basic task of trying to pull up netflix and hulu was nightmare the quiet click is top notch give that outta so ve had glitchy mice before and it was annoying but could deal with it for little bit they might twitch little or maybe vibrate some when the mouse wasn being used but this thing full jumps across the screen and not even in the right direction always use split screen and open netflix on the left screen and it pops up open on the right when move the mouse to the right it starts to move then jumps and ends up all the way back to the left it also lags every once in while and sometimes you put the mouse over something leave it there for second to make sure you are on what you want to click on and when you click it actually clicks on rows above where was this was on netflix this is nightmare of mouse do not buy its cheap mouse but not even the cheapest option you can buy cheaper mouse that functions properly the led lights did work just fine for me the next morning went back to using my mouse that is duct taped together until can get another one 
neutral,this product is useless and the quality is abysmal have never complained about any product purchased from amazon or through amazon in the last years as customer please inform all your customers that this product is cheap quality piece of damnation 
negative,remember to recharge it something neglected to do because am an idiot 
positive,this keyboard looks and feels really nice it nice and quiet and like the rainbow color display don game much so can really opine on its quality there but imagine the feel and reach of it is nice for those that do although that big enter button might throw you off little bit if you re not used to the layout kept hitting the insert key instead of the backspace from time to time have screen display two are daisy chained monitors using displayport and one is tv using hdmi noticed that in its regular position on my desk it seemed to type fine on screen have somewhat delayed buggy input on screen and perhaps due to the distance between the dongle and the tv no response on there moved the dongle to the keyboard to the top of my tower instead of the back side but it still didn accept any input from my keyboard when wasn even feet away from my computer to me that on top of not seeming to properly respond to my other screens is large drawback for wireless keyboard especially when paid for it had cheaper logitech that worked just fine for about feet and only got this one because it died three years later to the day and that model seems to be discontinued want to like this because it works great when it wants to but the problems ve had just in the first week aren worth what paid for it almost never return anything but think gonna have to with this 
negative,battery doesn last and stopped working after days very disappointed if could return it would don buy not worth it 
positive,nice and clear
positive,omg this is literally one of the best mouse ve used in quite while previously was using small hp mouse and it gave me hand cramps over time however since switching this mouse has revived my fingertips to give me better mobility as complete my college assignments or even surf the web 
positive,it good keyboard with caveats in order of personal importance the key layout is different from the typical keyboards ve used in the past years the backlighting is dim at its brightest and goes out quickly maybe there way to make it persist till some timeout period the keys are tad squishy but otherwise they feel okay
positive,the colors and sounds are really great 
positive,loud portable speaker that is very easy to link up to another jbl speaker for music playing in areas 
neutral,i purchased this for my office work and it broke down after weeks the scroll wheel stopped functioning be aware of this and look for something else with better quality thanks
neutral,bought this to replace little ue that had this speaker has no bass no mids its loudest volume is nothing compared to my much smaller speaker returning this after one day 
positive,it the cutest mouse like how sleek it is and the colors change all the time charge up the mouse and it lasts long time now that have pink mouse it time to find pink keyboard 
neutral,worked well on our camping trip
positive,got this for great price the size is perfect for my hands and is easy setup 
negative,it really nice headset was bit disappointed when found that the usb was only for the lights and that you needed the splitter for the pc sadly my laptop only has one jack so had to order another splitter just to use the new headset may have missed the description about all of that so it could be my fault it would have been nice though if the usb worked for both the lights and the headset 
neutral,didn work piece of crap
positive,my laptop mouse was sticking ordered this bad boy does great and the battery life on this thing is unreal it last very long time the lights super cute 
positive,absolutely amazing take it with me everywhere 
neutral,what like about these gaming headphones is the sound quality you can hear almost everything
negative,the led lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well am disappointed and would not buy it again 
neutral,works right out of the box has the charging cable and both usb options so you can use it on different comps older and new the lights are really cool too 
positive,works as described nice design and functionality highly recommend 
positive,great mouse
neutral,would recommend and would buy again 
positive,use for casual gaming sound is good and microphone works well have only just started using headsets for gaming with recent events driving me to spend more time on the ps this is the second pair ve had and am pleased with the purchase 
neutral,it is so pretty the lights are gorgeous love that it is rechargeable but the roller in the middle broke and haven even had it for months use it for work so it doesn get lot of use either 
neutral,it is decent for its price although its really tight on the head very good vendor got faulty one and got it replaced 
positive,very nice mouse love the size and feel
neutral,this mouse is very quiet like it says in the description pretty the only thing worry about is it is very lightweight the quality seems cheap but it hasn proved that yet will only use it for office work so hopefully it will not wear out or go defective 
neutral,after month the connection became very finicky constantly cutting in and out of the time typing is nightmare constant unread inputs look else where if were you 
positive,this speaker is absolutely the best 
neutral,loved it as long as it worked stopped working yesterday even tried charging it again but it wouldn even do that with only month to return if not working am out mouse and must buy another one too bad as really did like this model now onto shopping 
positive,good quality and nice sound
positive,won hold charge
positive,i purchased this wireless mouse to use with laptop purchased it on amazon due to the slimness color and uniqueness am exceptionally happy with the mouse and would recommend 
positive,i bought this for my kids so they could have gaming keyboard the backlighting works well and it set up without any issues hadn realized this was not only wireless but rechargeable so that was nice surprise very happy with the purchase 
neutral,i like the product and the idea too bad that once the charge goes it stops working figured the first one was lemon so got replacement but same issue no idea why but just works for like week and then dies 
positive,my husband is very picky about his speakers and got this as surprise for him he absolutely in love jbl has some of the best speakers this is the third one in my family now thanks 
positive,excellent headset the sound quality is good and it does cancel noise 
negative,do not buy keyboard went dead hours after returnability date 
positive,i like this item lot very fairly priced and the low profile makes it easy on my hand don have the largest hands but not very small either and mouse with high hump is very uncomfortable this solves that problem nicely could do without the sleep mode am still getting used to waking it up and understand the value of sleep mode so deal with it never having to deal with batteries is also bonus charging it overnight is ideal but have already forgotten couple of nights and it fine if necessary you can plug it in and use it while it charges 
negative,remember to recharge it something neglected to do because am an idiot 
positive,the sound is not as good as the extreme model but it does sound better good for the money wished had bought the extreme though
positive,the audio is actually good the doesn have the annoying feeling were after week your ears would and they fit well no problems here
negative,once got this product read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse and it will not work after minutes of messing with it the led lights started flashing and got it to work for little while then it stopped again this product is not good and needed it for school but would hate to take an exam and have these issues 
positive,update received response from the seller and they are sending me new mouse super quick response time so updated my rating super cute and fun that it lights up but doesn last only have had this months and the scroll broke 
positive,these headphones are really good can hear everything in the game and the noise outside can barley be heard id wish it came with stand option but outside if it the product is good
neutral,absolutely loved this mouse but it stopped working all of the sudden after reading reviews it seems several others had the same issue but guess that what you get when you purchase something that is only 
neutral,does not last x
positive,i love this mouse it quiet and pretty and the battery lasts while probably charge it once maybe twice week
positive,the headset is pretty good price very easy to start using and has sleek cool design to match it cancels out noise pretty good as well for example it blocks out the noise caused by fan have in my room my only actual complaint is that it is kind of small like it covers my ears completely but only barely does it do that if you are around or younger it should be fine but you may want bigger size otherwise 
neutral,i like everything about it
positive,i am so happy with my pick the battery life is great the sound quality is unbelievable sounds like big boom box 
negative,this mouse worked for while but then broke the led looked fake and crappy wouldn buy this if were but if are in budget it would do the job just be very careful with it 
neutral,type adaptor does not go in the computer port properly so it doesn work 
positive,my man love his speaker
negative,udpate you can use control shift together on the left side of the keyboard quick tab opens window movement what an abusrd error do yourself favor and buy different keyboard this keyboard hits all the nails except for the spacebar it seems to be made of an entirely different plastic than the rest of the keyboard and is distractingly loud if you re working in an office environment it likely you ll get looks from your co workers it ruins the entire keyboard experience 
positive,i like that the mouse is smooth it feels nice and light under my hand it is also smooth processing mouse it follows where you direct it with no lagging get lot of compliments on this mouse and it was easy to set it up 
negative,lights are very dim and cut off after seconds no way to change it this wouldn be problem per se but the letters on the keyboard are very dark white even with the lights in the room on they are hard to see until you press button to get the backlight on so if you use your keyboard in darkish room this is hard pass don have to look at my keyboard to type but if have let the backlight go out while think about something else and my hands leave the keyboard have to spend few seconds orientating my hands at the correct spot this is real pain also not as quiet as they make it sound ve had cheaper non name wired keyboards that were almost completely silent 
positive,all in all this keyboard is pretty good the key stroke is little long for my liking but ve grown accustomed to how hard to press the keys at first was missing lot of letters onscreen but after like week the typing became easy 
neutral,i glad after all the different choices of keyboards and all the different features believe choose the right one for me 
positive,pretty good for the price 
neutral,work
negative,the mouse works fine but was disappointed that the color did not match my macbook as it shows 
positive,jbl as company never disappoints the charge is great example the sound quality is great with deep bass and the battery life is excellent 
neutral,really like for gaming
positive,love it
neutral,good speaker full portability 
neutral,mouse is very lagging even after full charge 
positive,good sound quality but the mic is little quiet and ended up with short in the wire very quickly shows me as always talking and my friends say there low pitch buzz always coming from the mic 
positive,perfect mouse silently working
neutral,bought in december stopped working in february 
neutral,i bought this on october and it stopped working on april it started acting up on the th where the responsiveness was sketchy charged it that night and the next day it didn power up 
negative,if could put zero stars would my order came with the correct packaging but as soon as opened it it was not the speaker that is advertised someone replaced the speaker with used black speaker that isn even the same brand completely ridiculous 
positive,i lobe this speaker and truly lobe the sound and plan on getting another to complete stereo sound no it does not gibe you stereo but sounds good what don like is the bee changing prices on the same item done by amazon bought it lot cheaper than it is right now 
neutral,this didn last months before it stopped taking charge will not be buying another one 
positive,ok clearly this device is not an audiophile one arguably no bluetooth device is guess but really the high end is very lacking almost muffled sounding the low end is decent for device this size but it depends on where and how you position it against wall or corner tends to resonate better and gives better bass placed on the floor does the same and as others pointed out this is mono device 
neutral,to slow don buy
positive,this is very very nice sturdy headset especially for the great price have previously owned headsets that were at least triple the price and still think these are better not only are they comfortable they are perfect for gaming which is what purchased them for will definitely be purchasing items from this company from now on 
neutral,i only had it for week and it quit charging even tried other charging ports it would not take charge waste of my money
positive,purchased this keyboard for looks and for work it does the job nicely as regular low demanding keyboard haven game with it yet but could see it doing just fine doesn feel like real mechanical keyboard feels very plasticy and not the most high end keyboard out there the lights only have modes which are breathing and always on the lights are fixed as the same colors as well only bought this since it cheap and it looks cool if you want simple yet cool looking keyboard then this is good however if you want something lot more then look elsewhere 
positive,klim is fantastic company had never heard of them before purchasing this keyboard and have no ties to them had some trouble with the dongle connecting to the keyboard out of the box klim technology support service was amazing and went above and beyond the service is friendly and fast the keyboard itself is awesome my daughter said the keyboard is so nice she just wants to type things even when her work is done great for gaming looms and feels great promote all things klim what fantastic company 
neutral,stopped working after two days
neutral,gift
neutral,another lowest bidder production
positive,the product is great love that can use it with both my computer and xbox the headset fits nicely on my head if you have bigger than average ears this might not be the right fit for you the headset is single plug and usb plug it did come with splitter for headphones and mic if needed it comfortable design and the cord is super long it has button on the the cord that allows you to mute the headset it also has volume control that gives better control instead of having to play with the sound setting on the computer or on the tv if you are using it for console gaming would recommend this to all my friends 
positive,my daughter love the mouse 
positive,i thought it would work but after week and second one bought it won work 
neutral,it nice not to have to worry about replacing batteries 
neutral,full sound crisp definition of whatever you have playing

neutral,very laggy ended up buying different one no matter what did had to reset it every minutes because it was so laggy 
positive,bought this for canoe trip we ended up in the water so happy to have my new speaker float next to me while we put ourselves back in the canoe wonderful sound 
neutral,it really good and it cheap
negative,i returned this mouse because am sucker for design even though it only worked for one day and ordered replacement the replacement mouse has lasted weeks with intermittent issues however it no longer charges don waste your time and money
negative,failed to work in months
neutral,they were only good for three months want refund
neutral,doesn hold good charge
neutral,battery life is so short it might as well be wired mouse it charges with as usb cable dropped once and had to be glued back together 
neutral,scroll bar broke month after getting it 
positive,love it really fast shipping didn even expect to come today
neutral,cheaply made mine broke already barely used and it came apart and can snap it back together short charge life though it is convenient to have charge vs battery 
positive,easy light inexpensive quiet and perfect for my new mac laptop 
neutral,battery life is so short it might as well be wired mouse it charges with as usb cable dropped once and had to be glued back together 
neutral,haven had it long usb adapter is already broken so my mouse is currently unusable on my macbook mouse is decent but seems to not hold charge very long when was using it 
positive,great product for the price
neutral,i had this mouse for two weeks and then it just stopped working which is so sad because it so cute
neutral,i loved it until it stopped working today

neutral,doesn hold charge used it as mouse for my laptop charged it once and it stopped working
positive,this is great keyboard the keys are quiet and don travel far when pressed down it lights up well enough to be seen clearly in the dark and despite being make out of plastic instead of aluminum it seems fairly sturdy that said this is not the keyboard for me an old school computer programmer and am on my keyboard all day long prefer loud clicky keyboard reminiscent of the old ibm pc keyboard this keyboard is nothing like that it extremely quiet and the keys don travel far when pressed was looking for borderline typewriter feel this keyboard is more for gaming and such again this is great keyboard and clearly matches its marketing it was just not the keyboard was looking for 
positive,this was one of two klim products currently own and it performs beautifully for gaming and casual pc use the on off option for the backlight is awesome keystrokes are great love that there aren unnecessary tabs sticking out everywhere perfect keyboard to sit on your lap 
positive,i liked that the sound quality was great for the price it comfortable although haven worn for more than an hour but sure it will still be comfortable only drawback is the version got had the usb and six cable too short to separate can only plug in one or the other usb is used to light up and six is for the sound so either get lights or sound but not together unless hookup to power bank 
negative,stopped working after month will no longer click down unless heavy force very bad product
neutral,i should have read closely but the usb is for the lights thought it was for the output which is not compatible however we had to do adjustments on the computer to get the audio to work 
negative,well it mouse but doesn recharge has stupid little white old tech mini usb looks like it charging but it not this mouse was so thin it hurt to use for long periods but only lasted till the battery died has charger but it won recharge used multiple cables
positive,light weight very easy to use charging lasts for long like that it has the usb attachment in mouse making it perfect for travel
positive,it also super comfortable play for hours day and dont ever take it off because forget have it on 
positive,this headset out performs those more expensive headsets on here am so impressed how good they perform that what call bang for your buck 
positive,very portable the sound is amazing and loving the bright red color 
positive,this was nice mouse wouldn recommend for children as it broke when dropped on floor adult use seems like it would be fine 
negative,i even purchased new controllers they went dead after weeks 
negative,i was really looking forward to having wireless mouse that rechargeable but since it has to be recharged every day just use it with the wire attached very disappointing 
positive,already had one and loved it and got another for second home 
positive,i have not had this mouse for little over days love the feel of the mouse and how sleek it is however no matter how much charge the mouse it stops responding after about minutes of use have found myself removing the dongle from my laptop several times day just to make the mouse respond bought the mouse to improve my work functionality to no avail

neutral,thank you 
neutral,works as expected 
positive,great for gaming and extremely satisfying to type on the sleep mode comes on fast after minutes of not using it and will immediately turn on once you start using it again definitely worth my money and the quality is phenomenal 
neutral,product dont work
neutral,looks so cool
positive,i initially loved this mouse liked the fact could recharge it instead of batteries however after the first week it just stopped working have recharged it and still nothing

positive,good product good price
neutral,i bought this as wireless mouse have used it for less than month and it doesn hold charge unless it plugged in will be returning it and do not recommend this product 
neutral,this item popped up for results what compatible for ps and this is not
negative,dislike completely do not buy do not pass go this product is useless for its intended purpose yes want to use the light feature which requires me to plug in the usb cable which is only long same length as the audio cable that plugs into the controller unless your willing to sit with portable charger this product is of no use to me and recommend anyone that wants to use the product for its intended purpose to wait until they make the cable an adjustable length veteran nerd out 
positive,works good my son loves it
neutral,i like this keyboard overall especially how low profile the buttons are which prefer but the keyboard lights go to sleep way too fast and then you have dark keyboard

neutral,this headset stopped working after month do not waste your money

positive,perfect fit to my hand and matches my headphones 
positive,this mouse is very sheek and love it because the clicker is quiet however its bit flat and take some getting use to 
positive,first off this keyboard has been nice to type on considering the price at first the keys were bit too soft and required slightly more pressure to press but as typed more on it they loosened up and now feel great the keys feel clicky but soft enough where it not loud to type the space bar is bit louder but not as loud compared to other keyboards works great as an external keyboard for my windows and mac laptops do wish the max brightness of the keys was higher as it not as bright when the room light is on also it would be nice to have the option to change the colors of the lights like other keyboards that are around the same price range or cheaper lastly it would be slightly less annoying to have the option to use the media keys without needing to press the fn key for macs on my macbook pro with mojave was able to change the settings to where the ctrl key functions as the command key on mac you simply go to system preferences keyboard modifier keys and ensure that the correct keyboard is selected on the top next to select keyboard for me it was wireless receiver once the correct keyboard is selected changed the control key to command and changed the command key to control now the ctrl key functions as the command key however the windows key functions as the command key by default so these steps are not necessary if you re okay using the windows key overall would recommend it if you re on budget and don mind some of the drawbacks mentioned still great keyboard and battery life is pretty good 
positive,bought us christmas gift for year old rarely does he put it down and when he does he puts it back in the box so nothing happens to it he absolutely loves it 
neutral,i liked this mouse when it worked but the scroll real broke within couple weeks 
negative,it been just over month and it already broke so disappointing because did enjoy using it
positive,i ve been using this keyboard for about three months and ve only had to charge it about twice using it about hours day it definitely not the best gaming keyboard but for the price would say good buy 
neutral,easy to set up the ear pieces are soft and supple up and running in literally minutes the sound quality is seriously lacking horrible sound and absolutely nothing could do to fix it 
positive,i love it
positive,awesome
neutral,if not right hand suggest don buy it
negative,headset worked fine for one month and ve had it for months and it cutting in and out consistently not only the mic in parties but the speakers as well bought hyperx years ago and it still works with little to no issues still do not understand why the reviews for this product are so good you tend to trust so many star reviews but very upset with it the worst part is can get refund at this point so it was big waste of money update it broke weeks after this review was posted
positive,fits well to contour of hand withstands multiple drops to the floor battery lasts quite while after charging color changing is pretty 
neutral,the product seemed good and liked it until was just using it normally then it just stopped working tried charging it turning it off and on and reconnecting it but it still didn work would not recommend this to anyone and ve had it only couple of weeks 
neutral,like product thaks 
neutral,the product was lot more than anticipated am very pleased 
negative,worked well but dropped it off my desk on accident and it broke and no longer works 
neutral,i use these during my conference calls at work always clearest one on the call when tell them how much they disappoint me 
neutral,everything was good on except for the fact that the battery went bad really fast like within hours of use it would not hold any sort of charge after that 
positive,great sound for the money 
positive,i use them for gaming the sound quality is amazing 
positive,lights up for minute while plugged in to charge and then shuts off won turn on at all and the usb adapter it comes with doesn even fit into port my macbook a
neutral,no sound canceling these are just regular headphones the audio jack is weirdly thicker than it should be so hard to plug into things and very snug when you do they re very light and cheap but you get what you pay for if you want gaming headphones look elsewhere if you just need headphones with mic these are technically fine 
negative,not very good honestly it doesn get very bright and there is on different light modes most of the keys are only half lit and is hard to see during the day all in all not impressed with it will be returning it not worth the money
neutral,these headphones are not noise canceling not even little bit the sound feels off most of the time and it is also uncomfortable 
positive,my son is and he has no complaints about this headphone he said his friends also said they could hear him well and clear 
positive,works great on xbox for gaming highly recommending this product to all 
positive,i love this mouse very easy to use love the way the lights change color it just makes working brighter place
positive,love this speaker 
positive,great sound and battery life lasts ever
positive,this company has absolutely amazing customer service ordered this keyboard and it stopped charging after about month of using it so contacted the company and they sent me brand new one right away that works wonderfully without problem highly recommend 
positive,received this great looking headset in sept they stopped working nov th now have to purchase another set this will be the rd pair however hoping my grandson will search for different brand or something this time not sure he really did like these 
positive,bought it for my granddaughter just because she was very happy with it and arrived on time and undamaged would recommend to friend or family member
positive,i picked this up so could play the xbox games via the mobile cloud app they provide use this headset with my one controller via the plug to play the games enjoy and talk on chat playing my online games the headset fits wonderfully on my ears not too tight not loose however the ear coverings do not cancel out the noise as my other set does at home since this is an on the go out in the public headset consider this good thing as it lets me hear the close things happening around me and such the headset is light enough to not feel like giant weight on my head and feels sturdy enough to be durable for packing around in messenger bag with my phone and controller have thick vinal bag when traveling keep these in to keep them from getting damaged or dirty the sound is adequate on these don expect phenomenal quality sound like high priced headset the audio is clear and directional based on input from the games and such so can know what direction my team and enemies are in with that being said the glow feature really isn necessary but is very bright and attention getting when plugged into usb port which just runs the led lights in the earphones the bright blue would look really good on live stream or lets play if you do that sort of thing for the price paid hope these hold up with the constant going and moving around that do through the week ll come back when if they finally break fail to finish this review up and give input into the durability 
positive,great headset
positive,color shape size weight everything is okay but stopped working after few months update reviewthe seller has sent me new mouse and this is working fine really appreciate the gesture 
positive,i have had flip and clip before bought the charge the sound quality is always great battery life always seems to last longer than need and it always connects with no problem the clip is usually in my bathroom clipped to the shower rod and the charge is great for larger outdoor parties or to have sound throughout the house find them esthetically pleasing and they blend in to my decor while giving great sound this charge was on sale and got it for less than can beat that for the quality 
neutral,works as advertised does exactly what wanted 
positive,love the lights that shine thru very light and easy to pack for travel instant setup very pleased with this wireless mouse 
positive,it was great while it lasted this mouse has low profile it easy on the hands and eye pleasing white the internal battery holds charge well used it for work hr day and but it suddenly stopped working after few days short of months will look for something more durable for replacement 
negative,the wheel is already broken only use it for office use and bought it about month ago very disappointed 
neutral,lacks full sounding bass
positive,finally sleep mode that is done right all my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake pretty standard well when wake those other mice with right or left click it is active click which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens menu or activates what clicked always frustrated me lol well this one is super nice you click and it awake without doing an activation or selection have been looking for this in wireless mouse and have finally found it also it has nice feel not super ergonomic but nice the color selection is nice chose the grey the rgb lights are very pleasant to the eyes haven had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but will update soon the cable that comes with the mouse is very short but that isn problem the dbi variety is nice as well very happy with this mouse 
positive,it was great mouse until it stopped working and charging literally only used it about times since buying it and when put it on the charger this last time it just completely stopped working the charger light wouldn come on and it wouldn charge even switched usbs to see if it maybe had short in the wire and still nothing now that reading other reviews see the problem wish would have read them thoroughly before buying it buy this only if you want something short lasting with pretty colors other than that don recommend this at all 
negative,product defective arrived broken microphone does not work volume one output randomly changes would not recommend 
positive,sound quality is superb definitely better than expected jbl doesn disappoint 
positive,i like the sound quality my kids love it perfect for playing video games recommended
positive,it awesome
positive,just received my mouse connected to computer immediately with no hassle works smooth no jerky motion guides to your movement without any hesitation quite buttons with feeling of padding underneath love it lights are beautiful 
negative,worked fine out of the box until it needed recharging and now won charge it has blue light on it so know it getting power but as soon as disconnect the cord it dead worthless 
negative,terrible it didn work out the box bad product smh
positive,these are the best sounding headset ve ever had
positive, light weight but feels solid you feel the keys but no loud clicks easy to adjust the brightness and lighting modes wish there was way to adjust the sleep timer but other than that love it haven had it long enough to comment on the battery live but their usb is little short not major issue for me have spares up to feet long update on the battery life it great obviously it depends on use but it lasts as long if not longer than other rechargeable keyboards have used the usb recharges it fast when you need it to also have klim blaze wireless mouse and fusion earbuds love can use the same cable to charge the mouse and keyboard the earbuds have much longer cable than most ideal for moving around while you are plugged in to the computer 
positive,it not too expensive and it good value for the dollar it not the world most expensive but with expensive as headsets can be these days this one is very good middle ground
positive,simple lightweight easy to use love the led lighting that flickers when in use so you know if it in sleep mode the top coat finish is terrible full of dust debris not smooth 
neutral,i ve had them minutes haven even plugged them in yet but they are very comfortable think it odd that the extension part above each ear only slides in and out just tiny bit would have thought quality headphones would give you more room for adjustment just thought 
positive,i love the colors 
positive, days of usage and dead will not charge anymore but it worked great for days 
neutral,i do you like it so far but it started to come apart at the seam put it together bit concerned if it going to just do this again must be due to quality have been very careful with it
positive,perfect for gaming can hear all the shots in the distance dial in where footsteps are coming from at distance and still can hear my wife nagging me about how adults shouldn play video games from the other side of the couch
positive,the charge does not give the same bass and sound quality as the boombox but is really quite awesome in its own respect when you consider it is only the size of small thermos this baby really puts out great for picnics poolside and anywhere you want compact source of music was really impressed with the sound ain your grandpa radio that for sure 
positive,great quality at an affordable price
negative,i returned the same day received very poor quality and requires cord to charge no battery
positive,this mouse arrived yesterday plugged it in for hours per the instructions and then started to use it it worked great once got off work turned it off and went about my merry way when returned and had to check on something tried to use it again and it is completely non responsive ve tried different usb ports unplugging and replugging the dongle and even charged it overnight to ensure that it had full charge it does not work was so excited for this mouse it slim and quiet which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that do while still getting some work done on my vacations but it not worth the money less than hours later and back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn going to work any longer 
neutral,the mic stopped working and charging after few weeks
positive,like the quick response the mouse has lights up and easy to manuever love it 
positive,i just got the item and to be honest didn expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews thought it was relatively good the clicking tends to stick mine and tried doing cps clicks per second test and out of the time clicked the test only registered can say it wasn the tests fault since have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything for everyday work won say recommend it but it enough for that but for gaming do not recommend this since of your clicks won work because the mouse itself isn that great quality 
neutral,the noise canceling is false at first when used them they were good owned pairs of these and the same problem happened with both after while the sound only goes to one side you have to mess with the volume adjustment to get both sides to work if you move it even little it only works on one side again will not be buying again
neutral, beware stay away bought this keyboard in sept did not even last year fully charged checked connections nothing do not buy this junk you are throwing away bucks 
positive,definitely good product for the price the only thing wish is that could go slightly louder on some games other than that they re comfortable and keep out excess noise for sure 
neutral,worked great for less than month received in april and broke today may no clue what happened went to use it after taking break for few hours and it just fell apart and not able to put it back together 
positive,love love love my speaker ve been wanting one since saw my brothers and heard how clear and loud the sound was definitely recommend
negative,they are decent but very uncomfortable 
neutral,i like the overall design the slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive where struggling with this mouse is that as trying to work there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen also trying to hold and highlight group of text for some reason it loses connection what ve ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my shift arrow keys to highlight the text that need for general web browsing this mouse isn bad for productivity it not really working for me and going to go back to my wired mouse 
neutral,mic neverworked tried trouble shooting
neutral,disregard any negative comments this is great piece of gear 
neutral,stopped working months after got it
positive, feels good in my hand and works well the roller wheel works as third button which is important for my work colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that bonus it charges so no batteries and loving that the only issue finding is that it goes to sleep very fast if you wait to long to move it you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel not big deal just annoying sometimes overall happy with it 
positive,i love this 
positive,i ve been using mechanical boards for while and randomly used non mechanical one that found in my closet and realized like it way more so went to amazon to find better quality non mechanical board and found the corsair which was but then saw this board for only so tried this one out no complains whatsoever yet typing feels great fast response time very lightweight and wireless has been flawless update been using this now for years still has no issues and works great
neutral,i bought this last year not wanting to pay for premium mouse and after seeing so many comments turns out it mistake the mouse stops working after few months when work from home the pointer just doesn react at all only the scroll works if it functional mouse it actually quite well made and like the design overall my kid loves the color sadly have to put on this review 
neutral,i ve had this mouse for less than month and it already glitching out moving the curser without me moving the actual mouse cool colors though
neutral,good product
positive,it was very jittery on occasion went to replace it because it was quick buy to get me by until could afford better solution solution it served purpose but wouldn recommend the purchase if you could avoid it 
positive,perfect
neutral,good product 
positive,i bought these headphones for my year old son who loves video games he loves these headphones and says the sound quality is great he got the blue headphones because they were little cheaper and he liked them 
positive,this is jbl speaker so mean it is great quality there are many other speakers in the same price range that do not compete in quality or sound 
positive,this is over year old however used intermittently and recently continuously disconnects from multiple sources making it worthless to have to keep re setting every minutes and sometimes seconds our last jbl was amazing and had amazing sound for only years when power source broke we replaced power source and still working but should not have quit after years of occassional use great product too short of life span for products 
neutral,works right out of the box has the charging cable and both usb options so you can use it on different comps older and new the lights are really cool too 
neutral,only have had this mouse for months and already have to replace it the charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging the port is wobbling around not making contact to charge going back to battery operated wireless mouse 
positive,like our other jbl products it performs well 
positive,perfectly executed design with beautiful exterior doesn lose sound quality when the volume is set to high setting 
neutral,mouse worked fine for months charged it every week or so then wouldn charge via usb not good option for those who need something reliable 
positive,great headphones
positive,great headset for gaming
neutral,it works very well with my macbook
positive,cannot go wrong for the price buttons are totally silent and feel solid same with the scroll wheel not gaming most but ve had no problems with accuracy comes with slim usb port and pretty large usb port but it allows for usb passthrough which is neat can speak to battery life yet but it seems to have great power saving features so easily recharge with micro usb note this does not have bluetooth 
positive,great sound and impressive battery life
positive,works great good sound quality everything came packaged well had no problems definitely worth the price paid 
neutral,mouse is generic and seems like it worked couple of times then it was just never working good after that 
positive,great
neutral,these do not work waste of money no sound at all 
neutral,very nice
neutral, update since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering refund if took the review down when didn reply they offered me refund again in return would have to remove the review they stated they were small company and my review was hurting them but with over reviews don see how that possible the light goes off like it is charged however it won turn on more than about seconds ve tried different charging cords and same thing happens don waste your money 
positive,beautiful speaker love the dark green color the sound is crisp and clean just wish the volume would go just tad higher but that not really an issue 
positive,honestly extremely better than could have hoped 
neutral,all good
positive, keep it plugged in and also connected the usb to my laptop but not sure if have to charge all the time lol it doesn bother me but love this mouse 
positive,this headset gave way more than expected very happy with my purchase and it also super cute
neutral,omg what piece of crap can right clock seriously looks great did like the slimmer line of it too bad don work 
positive,works great
neutral,so loved this and use computer daily so you could say it is only intended for rare usage it broke within the month was sad specifically the scrolling button 
negative,i actually use this at work and the keyboard dims and brightens which is little odd but not deal breaker excellent little keyboard and fast shipping
neutral,more than expected from budget headset 
neutral,hurts ears and overall sound is not loud
positive,this is great portable stereo sound is great and volume can go very high glad purchased 
positive,great quality headset and sound lights are bright my boys age and years old likes it
positive,i loved this little mouse it looked great it felt great in my hand the wheel was nice for scrolling the battery even held charge for what thought was reasonable amount of time would categorize my usage as light moderate use and no abuse then came the day about month after arrival right after the return window closed that it started glitching now it drops off not responding then will work again then drop off again and not talking about sleep mode this is during active use back and forth back and forth it frustrating probably more because so desperately want mouse instead of my laptop trackpad all that said didn spend whole lot of money on this mouse so get what pay for just wish had gotten little more than month before the glitching 
neutral,i only used this month handful of times and after one month the roller on the mouse stopped working and go figure the seller only allows returns within the first month attractive mouse but doesn work long term 
neutral,if you can spend the extra money and buy something little better quality
neutral,cute but base too loud 
positive,quality of sound is great yet the loudness is not sufficient per price ve heard speakers that are sold for half the price with similar sound quality and louder volume considering return
positive,i went from flip to charge awesome bass this is mono speaker the flip is stereo which if you like hifi sound quality the flip is also mono the charge is loud and bass hits 
neutral,satisfied
negative,i bought one of these and in three months it completely stopped working couldn charge it or use it bought second one thinking the first one was bad one and the second one did the same thing buy something more reputable would not recommend buying this product 
neutral,speaker did not come with charger 
positive,i stay up late to play my games and this has been lifesaver no more loud tv at night very clear sound and lightweight on my head love it 
positive,klim customer care replaced keyboard for me that was faulty after months of use the replacement keyboard was at my front door days later outstanding service if you have any issues highly recommend klim 
positive,this is newer model had the first gen it lasted for while then it stopped working love this because it lasts for long time and it sturdy 
neutral,mostly good but can move the mic any closer to my face 
positive,i use it for working at home and it gets the job done for the cost it not extravagant but it does what need it to do would recommend it 
positive,thankfully didn buy this from amazon bought it from walmart it sounded great and jbl has always been favorite brand they had it for the same price as amazon so took it home and opened it up as amazon states it does not come with charger which is problem because it does not charge with standard usb charger plug it also comes with no instructions or documentation returned it for refund too bad because it really does sound great for its size guess you really have to go to big box store so you can hear it and check out how to charge it gave it stars for battery life because really can judge battery life since never got to charge it and use it gave it one star overall rating because if you can charge it with standard plug it useless 
positive,would give it stars if didn have to wait so long for it to arrive speaker is great tho sound is amazing 
negative,i love the clicky ness love the backlit lights but extremely upset that got keyboard usb plugin for bluetooth yet no cord to charge the keyboard came with it there weren any instructions just keyboard and plugin may have to return it so can set the time out setting on the lights very frustrating and waste of time 
positive,the mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly but you better not drop it or drop anything you re carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every minutes you use it there after should have expected this from such cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous 
positive,quality is great
positive,this was christmas gift that was big hit the sound is wonderful and it very portable in trip to az we simply threw it into our computer bag and it went right with us we ve had one initial charge and it been playing for days for the bluetooth we used jbl charge 
positive,great product 
positive,package arrived very quickly keyboard was charged when got it and just had to plug in the dongle and it worked just fine keys are soft but not too much so and pretty quiet the multi color backlight looks cool very happy with my purchase 
neutral, no stuffing in the box to keep the product for bouncing around in the box which came with dents all in it which can cause the product to become damaged in transit it seems like an issue they could easily address it advertised sound quality that it could not deliver on the sound quality is terribly poor it sounded like was listening to the tv instead of headset even though the sound was coming from the headset this is with the volume on the headset turned all the way up it was advertised as headset that can be used with gaming consoles you need usb for the lights but the chord for that is splits from the aux input and the chord is only inches after the split meaning if you re using controller your not able to enjoy the full experience of the headset because you would need to be have the controller inches from the usb source not to mention the lights aren as bright as advertised in the pictures it advertising noise isolating mic personal testing found this to be false not only could hear the video was listening to on youtube but could hear my air conditioning in the background not what would call noise isolation some people said the headset was too small found it to be too big in my experience either that or they are just too loose because of the padding quality on the ears can shake my head slightly and it ll fall right off when game like to immerse myself in the game which might mean small quick movements and leaning side to side that would cause the headset to fall off your head watch video for demonstration speaking of the padding on the ears that might be what causes this headset to not be noise cancelling my jbl ear buds have more noise cancelling capabilities than this headset does could still hear when someone opened the front door to my building while playing my game will be returning these and requesting refund 
positive,this mouse is wonderful love the feel of it it is ergonomically great use mouse all day long and this mouse is light weight and fits my hand the sleep mode feature is an added plus 
neutral,the type adapter doesnt work 
positive,this is slim quiet and absolutely love the changing of colors best mouse ve had 
positive,it really nice exactly what wanted except when it changes in light it does automatically and the transition is bit glitchy at times but still love it 
neutral,my last charge was lost stolen had no hesitation buying another just great speaker for most occasions 
positive,perfect

positive,small rechargeable and works perfectly 
positive,bought this for my son and he loves it great look function and value triple threat 
neutral,i am very disappointed with my order the headset worked for the first couple weeks and then stopped all of sudden you can slightly hear out of them but you cannot use the mic at all will not be buying again

positive,light weight rechargable lights are cute although they dont change no batteries needed this is nice
positive,plug play east to use sound and audio works great
negative,ordered this mouse in mid may in june it started acting bit off and could only use it turned on to one certain position yesterday august th the roller ball on top stopped working and now can scroll screens without using the sidebar very disappointed in how quickly this mouse stopped working my grandmother always said you get what you pay for and in this instance she was correct 
neutral,literally will not charge or hold charge
positive,great purchase with great price
positive,i was skeptical at first that such small ergonomic mouse would work pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged highly recommend this mouse and plan on buying another to have as backup for when forget to charge really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun 
positive,my daughter has used this speaker for everything it is lot heavier than we imagined but still portable enough to take out to the pool or cheer practice
neutral,bought these for my son months they worked well but then the microphone stopped working
positive,i love be good sterio gaming headset because high quality sound and bass in the headset is so amazing shooting guns while gaming plus hearing stuff behind you in game your are playing also love how you can connect the usb and your headset can light up while you use them
neutral,sund good
positive,works great and battery lasts long time ve used it everyday since purchased it month or so ago and havent had to charge it many times clicks are very quiet as well and the light setting looks amazing
positive,love this mouse love that don need to use batteries anymore it comfortable to use as well
positive,epic keyboard good battery and smooth operation service and support is second to none
neutral,my grandson lives then he can play his game for hours nonstop 
neutral,its great my only complaint is that it doesn warn you if the battery is low
positive,arrived on time as exactly as described the key board is wireless and works great the battery lasts long time
neutral,the clear sound
positive,i was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when received it couldn have asked for more for the money it comfortable in my hand the rubber texture really makes using it pleasure the dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn covered but it nice and tight so not worried about losing it so far so good 
neutral,this product is piece of junk it does not work 
neutral,mouse works great when you first plug it in but if you wait few minutes it will lag so much your better off using the laptop mouse disappointed in these high reviews because mine does not work 
positive,great product my year old is new to gaming loves his keyboard the colors are fantastic he had great time with the included product stickers decking out his pc casing headphones etc plus the letter product literature that came with the keyboard personalizes the product you feel connection to the folks who put their tlc into the product thx 
positive,works great battery life is excellent no latency couldn be happier with this own lot of klim products and they all exceed expectations 
neutral,my son uses the mouse for gaming on his macbook air 
neutral,it is not response at all it is very jerky and doesn react for several seconds have used several cordless mice before but this gets the thumbs down 
positive,love this mouse love that don need to use batteries anymore it comfortable to use as well
neutral,battery life lasts an exceptionally long time 
positive,i bought for my son and he loves it compact and portable 
positive,great headset for the price 
positive,i love this speaker the bass is ok but it sounds good 
positive,it really nice everyday mouse the sleep mode is little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn seem to be way to change it don think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing but it great for office use 
positive,i find that not having to rely on battery is relief the color change is very nice
neutral,only one side works wen your gaming straight trash 
positive,so it definitely doesn play for hours the battery was drained after five straight hours thought it was gonna be bit louder knew should have just got the boom box 
neutral,it doesn work
positive,it an amazing way to communicate on game
negative,this is functional in the sense that it does have keys too bad it has minute battery life and you cannot use it while it charging absolute trash product tempted to just throw it away 
neutral,i use for work it is needing to be charged almost every days 
neutral,i liked it and so bought another one and then the first one died month after the warranty ended don trust the product anymore and will be returning the second one because still in the return window 
positive,the microphone is too short so if you have big head the people ur talking to won be able to hear you 
positive,have issues charging it won get past the second light out of light battery charge the sound is awesome and everything else but ll have to call the manufacturer 
neutral,bought for my son for his game and it didn work think it needed extra parts but it did not say that 
neutral,could not get him to work on any of my game systems try hours
neutral,as expected
neutral,work very slow
neutral,worked literally for couple of minutes then stopped probably wouldn trust it with your apple products 
neutral,the mouse is fine but the scroll button started squeaking almost immediately and is pretty annoying 
positive,overall really happy with this purchase the keys feel nice and are quiet someone else review said that the space bar is very loud and while it is louder than the other keys it not obnoxiously so the battery seems to keep it going for very long time and still works while it charging my biggest issue which is not actually big deal is that could change the settings for the backlight time out the lights on the board go out after seconds wish could edit that so they stay on longer especially since the keys are really hard to see it dark in the room and the light is off another small detail wish this had included is that most gaming keyboards ve had in the past have little nub on the in addition to the and the keys like all keyboards have this doesn and find myself missing that also think it should be noted because didn see it anywhere when was buying it that the colors are in rainbow pattern seen in the photo and cannot be changed from that just assumed that could be changed but it doesn seem like it can
neutral,it good and all loud volume and noise cancelation but it has really long cables its probably for pc but also says ps so now have mic with long cable connected to my controller
positive,great for people who game alot
positive,the speaker sounds amazing it looks amazing brought it to the beach the other day said it on the beach and went out into the water and could still hear it for quite ways my boyfriend has two that we have velcro mounted to our boat and honestly think two is too many because it is super loud but all around if you were looking for small portable loudspeaker this is exactly what you re looking for 
positive,i really want to like this mouse even more than do the colors are cute but it has flicker that just goes consistently wish could continue to use this but think am going to have to get something else the flicker drives me nuts charged it fully and there is no reason it should not work when just got it today it would also be nice if the charge cord was long enough that you could use it while it was charging 
positive,speaker works and battery life is great
positive,the slim design feels amazing the price is perfect and the lights on it just make it fun worth it 
positive,perfect for around the house 
neutral,speaker crackles and can hear music clear 
neutral,has part plugin usb is for the lights and headphone jack for sound more for laptop than using with controllers 
neutral,i thought this headset worked great up until it constantly disconnected from the controller and have to position it over and over again it so annoying don even think abt buying this 
positive,the charge was much better charge that originally bought did not have the same dynamic range and was water proof surfing paddleboarind fishing never broke charge broke times now in water and breaks up all the time

positive,not into the latest commercial fads but am very impressed by these radios the size and sound is about the same as high end radio this streaming radio has an unlimited operating range along with solving many of the problems associated with bad reception truly revolutionary breakthrough for the still strong radio listening audience living in nyc am now able to clearly listen to one of my favorite radio stations from massachusetts along with one in my area that has weak signal love its portability along with its apparently long rechargeable battery life have listened to higher rated more costly products of the same size but honestly hear very little difference own much higher end powerful stereo system for more engaging musical experience well designed water resistant portable unit that can be used at home or outdoors have fun finding some of your out of area online radio stations and enjoy this wonderful new technology

neutral,finally the wireless rechargeable mouse works as advertised small handy recharging is easy 
positive,when bought this mouse really liked it it felt nice worked well on consistent basis and the colors give my desk pretty touch it was cheap so guess you can expect it to last but was hoping to get at least year after months of light daily use it doesn want to charge even if leave it plugged in all night in the morning it barely has any charge this is decent mouse if you don mind having to buy new one couple of times year but going to just spend little more and get one that is hopefully better quality

positive,great purchased 
positive,if you are looking for mouse that is small and slim pretty color and one that lights up this one does all of that and it is quiet while the little booklet is in foreign languagei am satisfied with my purchase and even though the seller offered no refund is necessary 
positive,i liked the ergonomics the most very easy to hold the mouse my palm did not pain inspite of heavy usage it restarts quickly from sleep mode consumes less power perfect buy value for the money highly recommend 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse super handy dandy because not only does it work with my mac it also works with my work laptop which is dell the only thing don like about it is that if you don use it for while it shuts off mean it great because it saves energy so you don have to charge it often but meh ve yet to charge it again used it for days for at least hours each day 
neutral,the battery lasts really long time hours while playing at medium volume 
neutral,after one month the mouse would not stay turned on even though it appeared to be fully charged will not buy rechargable again
neutral,you can speak to anyone when you use them ve checked all the settings and nothing 
positive,this is neat keyboard it smaller than my old wired one but that perfect it light weight and holds charge ve been using it for about week and have only charged it twice it hasn gone dead on me so not sure how long it lasts with full charge just need to make sure it doesn during gaming the lights turn off after few seconds of non use but sure that to save battery the colors are neat have lighted mouse pad that lights up with the same colors and it looks pretty cool all in all happy with this keyboard so far 
positive,very nice color best speaker ever owned sounds very nice 
neutral,i got this in june and it now the end of september it was great at first and lasted multiple days on charge but now the battery dies after just couple of hours and it dies randomly without any warning so it always in the middle of using it frustrating this lasted maybe months in total
neutral,the mouse works well asked is comfortable to use but the changing lights drain the battery very quickly 
neutral,i bought this jbl as change from our little bose portable speaker shouldn have the sound is meh is bass lite and certainly not worth the price paid expected more from jbl am sending this unit back and buying another bose 
positive,i really wanted to like this keyboard still do sort of lol the thin form factor lighting and silent keys are really great loved typing on it however after about week of light use and weeks of moderate use for work had to stop using it it would miss key strokes double them up or triple them keys would lag behind it was agonizing to use the battery seemed ok was going to buy the wired version but think ll just move on 
neutral,i like the idea of the rechargeable battery however the charge of the battery does not last very long will continue to use the mouse but intend to buy another for use when this one is being charged which is very often 
negative,my brand new jbl doesn charge even once hard reset didn work getting new charging cable didn work either had it replaced for another one and faced the same problem again not worth replacing again especially given the unreliability of the battery ll probably get bose or beats 
neutral,worked well for the first few weeks then broke right after return window closed 
positive,this speaker sounds clean and has good base
positive,nice looking keyboard nice to type on very easy to connect to mac but cannot type anything properly with an extra key near the enter button where enter or return usually is 
neutral,for gaming
neutral,doesn work for ps head phones will work not the mic 
positive,very good quality sleek and pretty use it for my desk at work the only issue is when using it to scroll page the ball starts squeaking otherwise it great 
positive,love this mouse and it stays charged for quite awhile
negative,the mouse has good shape and charges quickly but the roll just broke after one week of use
negative,at first really loved this mouse fast connection and worked well but like several other reviews mentioned after about months it just stopped working it didn charge or anything it just literally stopped working for that alone would rate it bad pedi to because it doesn last didn drop it or beak it it simply stopped working 
negative,i ve had of these randomly stop working in the last year both stopped clicking after minimal use less than days on the first one less than for the second don understand why this product is so highly rated it terrible learn from my mistakes 
neutral, months later my keyboard just stopped working as was typing thought it needed to be charged but even after charging it would not turn on after many attempts to get it going again by turning it off and on it would work bur for few minutes and then go all dark and become unresponsive would have rated it high as it was excellent when it worked but now it is useless 
positive,got this for christmas and so very happy with it the sound quality is amazing and get very loud 
neutral,worked well for few months now scroll doesn work
neutral,good headset
positive,i bought for my son and he loves it compact and portable 
positive,the big debate about this speaker not being stereo like the charge is really mute point when the speakers on the charge are only few inches away from each other anyway not enough stereo separation to make any difference in real world listening environments in my opinion found the sound quality and loudness of the to be very impressive for such small package and would not use the fact that it only has one main speaker in front affect your buying decision at all great little speaker and long battery life just what was looking for
negative,first the american flag and corporation website does not like to tell you where they make their products got the keyboard and it said made in china then proved it was made in china by the keystrokes not working demanded my money back and warn anyone to avoid china malfunctioning keyboard that pretends to be an american product not cool 
positive,my son loves it
positive,works well plug and play easy to charge kids love the color and lights 
neutral,this mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it not sure what went wrong but it just gave out and that was it 
neutral,so at work and my buddy has the flip have the charge theyre the same in volume upset because this scheme cost me more and had buy the case separately bucocky 
positive,this does work with the xbox series you do need to adjust the volume initially on the xbox itself the led lights only work when connected to usb overall great sound but wish the bass was little better

positive,my son loves them for his game 
neutral,i followed the instructions to the letter and it was slow and laggy 
positive,the mouse performs just like it states perfect design smooth scrolling and quality product 
positive,this mouse is good quality for low price love the multi colored led lights on the side and middle chose the blue and feel like it adds pop of color to my office however the blue paint is already peeling on the bottom and ve only used it little while not sure if it came like that or is already wearing there are probably other products for similar price that could be better quality 
positive,i love the keyboard and mouse combo they work great and the company support team is amazing they helped me with my issues through email and they are fast and responding back quickly 
positive,love the sleek design easy set up fast charging and most importantly how quiet the mouse isit not the most ergonomic mouse and it lacks wrist support so have to stretch lot more but as long as you re not gaming this mouse is great 
neutral,the product is used for gaming 
positive,light weight with great sound and battery life don expect reference series sound but for portable speaker to use with cellphone or tablet it provides great sound 
neutral,works for about month fine then mic goes out
positive,i bought this product months ago the wireless had good range you can use it while charging color led looks good during night time simple and handy fast charging on off buttons worth for money

positive,excellent sound
negative,i loved this speaker until it decided to not work it now turns on and immediately turns off it about year old and only handful of uses mostly used it in the garage fully charged battery but acts like it dead read it could be the battery installed new battery and that not it wouldn buy another one contacted jbl and they said that it was out of warranty and that since attempted to replace the battery it voided it which understand just stinks that it took premature crap out on me 
neutral,mine is not working after month of use
positive,i like this keyboard because it is quiet when you type on it and the backlit colors make it more enjoyable worth the money spent on it 
neutral,my daughter was thrilled to receive these for her birthday 
positive, so it extra light easy to work and love it for the price no pesky batteries
positive,great
positive,great gift he can play and can sleep 
neutral,this product is worth the costs we have been using this headset frequently for over year and it has performed without any concerns 
positive,love this mouse it very smooth and the battery life last pretty long the led lights are bright but not too distracting if like to game in the dark like do ended up losing the small piece that goes plugs into my computer tho wish could just order that piece also if the charger was bit longer that would be better hate trying to use the mouse while plugged in charging it has no range other than that it good buy
positive,the headphones have nice design they the best headphones have own so far the sound quality is amazing as well 
positive,hello received the new mouse today thank you and your service is very good again thank you but the only concern that have is that the box is open and my power cord is dirty and not wrapped up the way it should have been but that is okay am going to plug this one in and it work then we are good to go again thank you so such for fast re supply give you stars mr ronald wooten
positive,i bought mine in mint green it almost effortlessly easy to set up the battery is lasting beautifully absoulutely love it soooo much just ordered my daughter one in the dark gray she going to love the led lights thank you 
positive,great sound quality
neutral,it flimsy and the battery doesn last long you constantly have to charge and you can put batteries waste of money
neutral,the user guide and charge cable did not come it was supposed to 
neutral,the photo is misleading only one color shows at time mouse is not as accurate as most 
neutral,good
neutral,it didn work with the switch had to return it
positive,so far my son loves them and so does my fiancee neither one ofthem can hear me when tell at them for help bringing in the groceries lol
positive,my son loved this headset thought the lights were awesome and had great sound perfect for gaming and virtual learning 
neutral, 
positive,works great it little too small and would stress my hand if used it all day everyday but don so keeping it and am content to be more specific the buttons are not directly below my fingertips which would be solved by longer mouse or an ergonomic one that has little more height to it an averaged sized male and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha hope this helps 
neutral,used it only for the past months and it doesnt work anymore 
neutral,ease of use and portability
neutral,no complaints so far
neutral,very good speaker with exelent sound quality
neutral,the mouse didn track well and kept freezing and then my laptop shut down within seconds of plugging the adapter in would avoid this one 
positive,it nice and good

positive,product came as described year old son says it works great purchased for gaming and solid sound quality 
positive,i really love my mouse have no issues at all thinking about ordering my sister one she saw mines and instantly fell in love with it order you one you won regret it 
neutral,does not work with the ps and they are not well made the ear ad came off almost right away and they don even work well with the computer in order to have sound you need mm jack which the ps does not have the usb seems to be power source for the brilliant blue lights don recommend these at all the lights are nice but not worth it since they don do what they should 
neutral,was working fine then surly the clicker in the middle stoped working
neutral,it worth the frustration if was you just get different one
positive,it great mouse to have if you are trying to have mouse that can be used on type only device while keeping the option of normal usb open 
positive,at first it felt cheap but pretty much like all other perfect for what needed 
positive, ive had for about year and only used it on occasion it worked pretty good until started using it on regular basis mouse slowly stopped working more and more until now it doesn track any movement at all do not buy unless you want to throw away
positive,absolute great product sound ease of use and portability is amazing 
neutral,i wish the earpieces were little twisty but im just nit picking here 
positive,the ability and flexibility of the device inside and outside the sound is perfect 
negative,i bought this because of the lights and it looked cool but it does not have battery it needs to be plugged in to charge unless you babysit it by always turning it off when you are done using it the charge dies after days and then you have dead mouse or one that is now wired as it charges too high maintenance for mouse 
positive,this turns out to be exactly what needed the seller is so nice they sent little bit of extras like stickers and funny note to go with everything else they also have great customer service and are really willing to help with any issues great purchase 
neutral,many functions in many programs use ctrl shift ctrl shift does not work in any way on this keyboard this is unexpected and totally unacceptable behavior in keyboard these key combinations are intrinsic to many functions in windows it is time to return for refund darn liked the size and feel but functionality is compromised and need working keyboard not crippled one 
positive,excellent range and sound quality
positive,this mouse is awesome its sleek and it works so well it also looks great 
positive,there isn anything that don like about like it very much 
negative,this speaker is built so horribly ive had it less than month and since the second it was delivered it was broken the speaker will not turn at all unless its plugged in once on none of the buttons work and you cannot turn the device off unless you hold the power button for minute and even then it randomly makes noises but then once its off again you cannot turn it on unless plugged in eveything about it is broken and frustrating do not waste your money and no they will not offer to fix send new one terrible
neutral,battery inside the mouse is it not recharable it not working after battery life gone so after months of usage it not working try to change the battery but it very difficult to change battery need to open the top cover and removing batter is not easy even after changed the battery also it not working it looks like one time use only 
positive,for the price it has excellent noise cancellation the audio quality is good and the overall comfort of the headset is appreciated it adjusts and doesn bother me or my glasses 
neutral,i would ve liked it to be little crisper sounding
neutral,most to all iphone eqs sound good on this speaker however the bass could be touch louder other than that it bit heavy so when take it places it usually ends up taking up the middle of the passenger seat or the backseat nonetheless max volume on this thing packs punch 
neutral,literally will not charge or hold charge
positive,product feels like it was designed for child head shorter mic and tight fit 
positive,my son uses this for playing xbox games and he loves it
positive,i love this speaker so glad purchased it highly recommend 
neutral,im typing on my broken keyboard the one this pile was supposed to replace
neutral,worked one time after that my daughter couldn get them to connect again 
positive,worked great for month mouse connects via usb receiver ve only disconnected the receiver few times when not using the mouse however after disconnecting few times can reconnect the receiver without it being loose the instant my mouse connects it will disconnect because the usb is too loose now after month edit customer service reps have reached out to me offering me money to delete my review 
neutral,battery won hold charge the first one failed within days and was replaced the second one failed one week after days and out of the support period 
positive,it is amazing buying the boombox
neutral,the rating on this item is far from reality the speaker sounds like it is busted and the bass crackles not so sure how this has the rating it does 
positive,absolutely nothing disliked about this product its better than advertised only thing is it looks as though it was made in china yeech but it is very good product going to get another one
positive,headset is comfortable and great sound quality
neutral,the product came as described it just not that loud to me turned my sons nintendo switch lite up to the loudest notch and even turned the headphones up but it not loud at all
positive,that was my first review but the mouse did not work the seller replaced it immediately and that one works fine again be aware that this is rechargeable mouse and you cannot replace the batteriesthe seller should ve been clearer that this is recharging mouse and don know how you replace the rechargeable batteries so that the only complaintotherwise it great mouse
positive,love it
neutral,this mouse is not bluetooth compatible usb only
positive,love this product working from home and love the color works great
positive,it is okay the scroll wheel and clicker are quiet but the mouse emits super high frequency noise any time it moves have become aware of it and can stand using it much anymore 
positive,my son uses these headphones for pc games the head phones arrived quickly they work great and have great noise canceling capabilities the blue lights are also an added extra for year old boy 
neutral,its pretty dope 
neutral,works well 
neutral,solid headset for the price
neutral,i had the mouse working for one day then could not use it any further the mouse pointer had mind of it own and would take over it own movement what disappointment was hoping not to go back to battery operated mouse say do not buy this product 
neutral,it not damaged the cord isn messed up but bought it and today it already done lol if connect it the sound doesn fully come through like as if you have to keep adjusting the cable like an old school broken ipod the mic isn working bc of this terrible would have rather bought another brand same price don buy 
negative,lasts for few hours at close to max volume and obviously longer the lower the volume is great over all for the price but the back has an annoying clicking sound like the screws to panel are lose 
negative,it quit working after less than months ugh it no wonder they only have day return policy 
positive,great
neutral,works great no issues
positive,i loved the product 
neutral,as title suggests easy maneuverability responsive and lower than my previous mouse 
positive,the item is easy to work with but honestly got it because liked the led light feature however the mouse does not light up 
positive,good mouse for my laptop great feel and comfortable 
neutral,disappointed brought these headphones for my daughter for ps for christmas and they do not work at all and advise everybody as soon as you get the headphones try them because they don work at all
neutral,the clicker won work any more because the rolling piece broke
neutral,it broke in week
positive,it was given as gift because already own one and she loves it 
positive,the mouse arrived today easy to set up so far it is working properly like the fact that it rechargeable no more aa battery to replace ll have to get use to its size lot shorter than my old morosoft mouse hope it lasts as long as the old mouse time will tell 
neutral,works perfect smooth no issues battery last forever
neutral,the lights also like the noise blockage 
positive,as with several other reviews here the one purchased lasted several months until it just stopped tracking mid swipe thought maybe it just needed recharge as that what it has done in the past when forgot to charge it overnight but no it more like it just shorted out works for swipe and click and then stops again kinda sucks because it really cool and fun mouse with the led lights and the charging vs batteries guess ll look now to see if the warranty will help girl out 
positive,i love these headphones 
positive,did work perfect bought it for my boyfriend in may now is july and is acting up with the noise in the headset 
positive,great outdoor speaker to keep on the patio or take to the beach it is mono speaker so better for portable or outdoor use great color 
negative,these headphones are awful static every time you move not worth rather spend and get something decent
negative,it was good mouse while it lasted but died on me suddenly months after purchasing purchased and died 
positive,i liked everything about it but the jack the braided cord separates from the plug pretty easy so if buy maybe reinforce it in advance otherwise great sound lightweight comfy and worth the buy
neutral,the key labels are wearing off after months 
positive,i love the option to turn off the lights it is nice that its rechargeable and can be used while charging if needed the color got was mint color do not recall what it was listed as it is fun color and the light on the mouse are an added bonus 
positive,its perfect
positive,easy to use and sounds amazing 
positive, absolutely love it and it is rechargeable changes colors the battery lasts forever stars
positive,this keyboard is amazing while wish the rhb was addressable really cannot complain
neutral,started out pretty nice but after weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly even after charging all night after about minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements update the vendor keeps sending me emails asking me to delete this review for guessing they don want me to write this on the review but ve told them no three times now and they just sent another one ve told them that it unethical ve told them its completely against the spirit of reviews in the first place and there another one in my inbox sigh guess just forward another one to the customer service department of amazon 
neutral,cheap flimsy components and the charge lasts about minutes 
positive,this is so pretty fits my hand perfect the lights are soooo pretty lol it was beyond easy to set up on my laptop it came partially charged even so could use right out the box easy to charge lasts really long time too love it would totally gift 
neutral,works on xboxdoes not work on pc or ps
positive,great product love the long battery life 
positive,got this for my boys and they love it easy to use and is noise canceling scream for them and they honestly dont hear me lol its also made of like metal good material and prettier in person
positive,i like this mouse very much it moves smoothly and is small so there is no discomfort for my hand the only thing do not like is the on off switch it is very small and hard to make it move 
positive,this klim would likely be an incredible gamer keyboard which is what it made for it sturdy has cool multi colored backlight so as long as you re young and or can type without looking at the keys you ll probably love it wanted backlit bluetooth keyboard for my laptop but the klim multicolor backlighting made the keys appear inconsistent and so were difficult to read the top characters of some keys didn light up as well as the bottom ones on the same key and found the different colors simultaneously left to right across the board added variability to the characters that impacted their legibility for me ended up keeping seenda much thinner and flatter adjustable backlighting in choice of several colors but only one at time so the keys were consistently bright sharp and clear 
positive,i think they are good especially for the price but wish that they were more adjustable they are great for sitting up and listening to tv or gaming but if you want to lay down or have them adjusted to your head they are not good they feel bulky and don quite fit to my head for someone with slightly larger head they may fit however with them not being adjustable think my problem would be flipped if someone with really large head put them on as they are not adjustable also the two connection types with one cord hanging all the time is just huge bother and it is definitely design flaw there should be some way to tuck the unused connector up so it doesn dangle and become nuisance sound noise cancelling and upright use is all good though gave it because of these factors 
positive,i purchased this back in october but didn open it until when my new computer finally came in used it for one day and it worked great and now won charge at all or even turn on when plugged in instructions say you can use it while charging but won even do that guess should have tested it out when first purchased it won be buying another one 
neutral,product quit working after return window of one month closed
positive,they have great sound and the mic is clear ordered blue and got red but im still very satisfied my last headset was about and they did last years but these have much better sound quality 
positive,just received the headset sound looks good think its worth the price 
neutral,good headset for gaming 
positive,great and affordable 
positive,i generally don give five stars unless it something extremely love but this little bar of sound is totally awesome amazing extremely worth the money this tiny little bluetooth speaker is amazing it super small but the sound is pretty loud it very portable and you don have to constantly be charging it even at max volume we have two big sony speakers that can light up party they re also wireless but they re extremely heavy and take up lot of space and they are way too loud for public reunions so we decided to get this jbl portable speaker and it was the best thing we did it portable because we could take it camping to the beach or pool or lake and the sound is great and even if you drop it in water or juice it continues to work amazingly 
neutral,mic stopped working after use bought it in advance for birthday and can return it fun 
positive,this headset is great for gaming and basically anything else it has volume switch so you don have to bend over your keyboard to press the volume button and you can change the volume as well my favorite part is the cushion at the top my last pair of headphones were very uncomfortable but now my head feels lot better because of it and it also has headset microphone so you can chat with friends the only downside is that the cord is very long and it so it can sometimes get in the way if you re playing game but all in all these are great high quality headphones for very cheap price this was written by my year old son who plays games on pc and other platforms he loves these heaphones 
positive,the design is beautiful the led lights make the mouse look amazing specially in dark places love the fact that it doesn make click sound it charges very fast and it lasts very long great price for such great product 
positive,it was fine until it just stopped working months in do yourself favor and spend little more money to get well known brand like logitech 
neutral,could be louder when connected through the xbox controller
neutral,i never write reviews as matter of fact this is the first have ever written but due to the danger factor felt compelled to my son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire 
positive,there great loved them
neutral,speaker works as advertised
positive,tiny body with great performance sound loud enough deep enough slightly weak in high tones but not big problem 
negative,i purchased this keyboard months ago it performed well for the price but it just died for no reason at all 
positive,very nice responsive
positive,used mouse for less than week it will not hold charge used for less than hours this morning after charging for hours and it now dead but when it worked loved it it was light quiet and very colorful 
positive,i bought this keyboard because it was one of the cheaper ones with decent reviews and have to admit for the first month or so it was great but now it doesn connect well wirelessly and it hassle to try and get it to register the keys pressing which is frustrating when first got it there were no issues and it was comfortable enough to use like most standard keyboards and the rgbs are nice but the sleep mode gets tad bit annoying after while 
positive,it works very good and the price is perfect 
positive,i love the quality of the sound the device is easy to set up and it pumps out great bass and treble my house has concrete walls throughout the house so can use it beyond line of sight of my laptop would definitely recommend this
positive,probably the best portable speaker have owned great sound quality lots of volume if needed and very good battery life 
positive,quite and really easy to use 
neutral,price isn bad for starter especially for gamer sound quality is great recommend for anyone on budget need to get head set for my ps so purchase this one
positive,this product fits like dream compared to the razer kraken line of headsets the mic isn as adjustable but prefer fixed mic as it won wear as badly and the mic quality seems comparable if not superior the cord is high quality as is the included adapter for being stock part they look just as cool as the photos aesthetically as well 
positive,when received product knew it was what wanted nice raised keys nice crisp click then of course after throwing awaythe box and packaging and really getting down to using it irealized the cap key does not work urgh my mistake for sure make sure you use it for while before discarding anything 
neutral,i really liked everything about this product 
neutral,the sound is definitely not that great
neutral,bought this twice because it matched my keyboard both times it broke within month used it lightly throughout the day too
positive,this mouse feel different from others used it light comfortable and easy to control my hand doesn have stretch pain after using this mouse at work for whole shift not light the old one 
positive, works very well keep the led light shut off to save battery ve had it for about week and haven needed to charge it yet shut it off when not in use it so nice not to have cord to deal with want to buy another one love it so much the color is gorgeous 
positive,i purchased this mouse for my daugyer and live that she loves it had wireless before but nothing compared to this one easy set up too would definitely recommend this mouse 
neutral,after day or the mouse would not work at all it was not problem with the connection my computer was able to pick up the bluetooth no problem the mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some sort of charger kind of defeats the purpose of wireless mouse 
positive,i have been using this keyboard for about or days now and so far it works really well for it intended purpose love the way that the keys feel and that the lights look when am typing that being said there are few things that knocked this keyboard down to only stars the first is that while the keyboard is advertised as being silent this is not the case in fact have found that some of the keys that are more commonly used such as the enter key or the spacebar are actually louder than the rest of the keys for me this hasn been huge deal but can see how people would be upset if they bought it with the intention of having quiet keyboard the second thing is that the led lights are not as bright as would have wanted in the dark they stand out perfectly and look amazing however in daytime or brighter lighting the lights are hard to see and draw away from the overall aesthetic of the keyboard 
neutral,when using at higher volumes the sound has some distortion
positive,it was cute and worked super well while it lasted but about weeks into using it it just stops doesn hold charge doesn stay on of course it lasts beyond when you can return it so just don take the chance 
positive,connected this speaker to bluetooth transmitter connected to my control amp great sound outside on the patio very easy to use can be used to charge your phone

negative,microphone doesn work bad sound quality dont buy
neutral,the first headset received was busted the sound barely worked in only one ear piece so sent it back in for new one the return receiving for the new headset was easy and quick now the bad part the headset is lower quality than the description let on felt that the headset sound wasn the worst definitely step up from an earbud headset the mic however doesn past any quality test of mine have always had an easy time of speaking to my team friends but after getting this they could barely hear me they described it as if were across the room trying to speak into the mic obviously wasn was disappointed with my purchase definitely going to purchase new headset from more reputable company

neutral,the mouse is not large enough and does not hold charge for long 
negative,for you are better off getting wired mouse this thing is so bad the sensor light bleeds through the top shell of the mouse worse is that the actual functionality is very poor if your are looking for an accurate mouse this is not it have multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use if you have plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable but if your on the go this will not do 
positive,great quality headphones love the audio output easy to setup highly recommend them 
positive,if you want great keyboard without the high price then this it it is quiet unless you pound the keys don know how long the charge last as charge it at night the keyboard is spill proof spilled coffee on it and after drying all night it was working great again the seller was quick to respond to email about it not working after spilling and told what to do which had already done they stated they would stand by warranty but didn need it as for adjusting the lightening haven tried as like it as it is would recommend buy wrist support for keyboard got one for about that included one for keyboard and mouse on amazon

neutral,great little mouse it does not tell you that it is about to die though and you have to plug it in to charge it no batteries which will slow you down if working or gaming with it

positive,i gave this to my sweetie for christmas two days ago got call from him today telling me in detail how he had set it up and used his additional jbl bluetooth speaker with it as well he can be quite the critic being an manager but he could only say wonderful things about how easy it was operate and the quality of sound that was achieved with one small speaker thank you jbl for making my gift to my guy very special one 
negative,cheaply made usb port is so poorly made it does not fit in port which makes the mouse worthless for use with my surface mouse does not feel comfortable in hand just pass on this one 
positive,love this mouse it sleek and quiet no loud clicking noise glides seamlessly will be back for another for my wife thank you 
positive,love this mouse
neutral,battery life is shorter than advertised on this speaker other than that it connects quickly through bluetooth and has full sound
positive,i like that it recharges and doesn require batteries it doesn last that long though but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even minutes wish it came with longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in still can but very short cord 
positive,boys use these for fort nite and they work great they are not to heavy what so ever and that has been my challenge recommend these if have kids and under
positive,great quality
positive,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing imo it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the options are just on constant red light or cycles through colors clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some wd onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing wd into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn scroll at all it just spins soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh
positive,it colorful and works great 
positive,best quality headset for gaming

positive,i didn like the way the light shown thru the top like the plastic was super thin and semi transparent and it didn come thru evenly have been using it for while now and it sometimes gives me trouble have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes just unplug usb and plug back in fixes it still stars because at this price it great

positive,i wanted to love this mouse the first one randomly stopped working for no reason it was past the return window so bought another one hoping it was just fluke or that did something wrong even though sure didn bought second one and that one too stopped working randomly after the return window closed won be buying this again
positive,this keyboard is great for gaming but when got this it came with downside is that my space bar was squeaky not too loud but definitely noticeable but later down the road with the keyboard it just recommendation to the product is at red light for the battery light so you can tell if it is low cause could be gaming and it does with no sort of warning but overall great product it works amazing

neutral,item does not work
positive,sleep mode turns off the keyboard after minute and when it dark it gets to be annoying wish it was adjustable but it not minutes would be better other than that it works great 
positive,it pretty comfortable and the noise canceling is pretty good it great for gamers especially starting gamers and younger gamers however not sure if it just me because have smaller head but they could look little funny big when wearing also when playing sometimes the people that talking to don really hear me well at times or can sound low soft another thing noticed is that when it plugged into my controller it sometimes make loud static noise often not sure if it because of the cord not being put right by myself or because of the cord itself 
positive,great headset and like using it fits comfortably and has good sound quality 
negative,i purchased this mouse thinking it had usb connector not usb with usb adaptor my bad opted to keep it three stars on its scrolling as it was not smooth but it worked would have kept it but after couple of weeks it died and would not charge despite being plugged in for hours don waste your money go with tried and true brand

positive,the design is nice but these headsets aren worth it it use to light up when plugged in and play sounds loudly when first got it but not anymore the sound has to much bass and staticky from the beginning the microphone would not work despite following the instructions to turn it on so just used it for work to hear notifications when stepped away my computer won recognize the headset anymore even when the lights are turned on just prop now

positive,it is exactly as depicted my old mouse just wasn working correctly even with new battery was banging on it to get it to respond this one is just as advertised changes colors and responds on just slight touch love it 
positive,i like this keyboard because it is huge improvement over my old non backlit unit do believe that there is alot of room for us older folks with sight problems the back lighting would be much improved by making it all one color either bright white or the bright green increasing the size of the letters numbers and symbols would also help the unit functiond well and it was easy to put into operation it is very light weight and is not as flimsy as some others who have rated it have mentioned it is keyboard not hammer 
neutral,just over month old and the roller no longer functions realize these are cheap but month use exclusively for work not heavy use

positive,for my son and he loves it
negative,can just say wow this mouse is absolutely incredible the wireless feature and led lights make this thing steal for its price it is super helpful when want to stay in bed but still use my pc from afar can just pull this bad boy out and start going it has silent clicks to it as well so you wont be waking or bothering anybody buy using this mouse and with its low profile shape and structure it takes up practically no room whatsoever

positive,just love it all the time
neutral,i purchased this months ago for work at home really like everything about the keyboard accept the letter quality as you can see by my picture within months the letters have started to rub off it has the backlight but it doesn matter because it lights the key and not the letter so you don know which key it is unless you have them memorized next time would pay bit more for double shot laser etched 
positive,easy to set up connect happy with this product
negative,if try connecting two or more the music is delayed and jumpy like they are buffering it and not sure whos playing what or when when they are solo they kick ass

positive,i had given star review the lady julia got in touch with me and replaced my son gift with new pair the new pair are wonderful and are working perfectly fine now he was very excited to receive the replacement so thank you so much
neutral,this keyboard was great for while it definitely good for the cost however after two years the battery is constantly dead and the keys are not registering really wish it actually lasted longer don use it for gaming only for office work 
neutral,product did not work as expected
positive,cordless mouse is okay out of the box after few months of use it starting to wear out now have to start double clicking to make sure it responds to the icons click on colors are still great it great not having to change batteries it pretty much quite as far as clicking but as noted above it will still wear out sooner than expected 
positive,since mainly draw art didn see need to have bulky gaming mouse this fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when drawing at night while the family is asleep the ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option it good buy for casual office or laid back working experience 
neutral,real like this mouse it stays charged for long time 
neutral,really good keyboard
neutral,it is exactly as pictured works well 
neutral,i own two charge speakers that are still working well with my android phone many years later bought this charge for my mother who has just recently started using an iphone 
positive,my last headset lasted me years and finally died on me orded this one thinking it looked good first off the mic isnt curvable to so cant put it closer to my face and its to far so now its half way on my ear so can move it closer to my mouth my friends can still barely hear me when im not speaking loudly and this is problem since have year old that sleeps near me ive also listened to myself and sound like im inside of can the only postive could find is that its really comfy and the sound quality is ok ill be sending this back tomorrow and ordering another rig headset since they clearly understand whats needed to make good gaming headset 
positive,got this on sale great value
neutral,not suitable for long term it broke after months 
positive,working great plugged in or wireless have no problem so far
positive,sound is not as pure and clear as like
neutral,son used for gaming they worked 
neutral,garbage returning it volumn keys do not work light is underneath the keys and do not light up the letters numbers and symbols printing on keys are too small and unreadable unless you have very young eyes returning it

neutral,i love the fact that there are no batteries just charge and go 
positive,the bass is super cool like playing it in close room 
positive,love this speaker barely have to charge it battery holds up great we use outside at our pool and can charge my phone on it while using 
neutral,this mouse worked well for while months but now it is very unreliable switched usb ports got an extender thinking the connector was blocked by my metal desk that helped some but it lags and the click only works about half the time have classroom full of first graders who are waiting on my silly mouse to get it together so can show them the next slide or open the video for them it has been super frustrating will be purchasing another brand 
positive,quick easy set up and great sound 
positive,the battery life is amazing the sound is great take it with me to the beach all the time great purchase 
positive,love them 
positive,update received replacement pair after the mic on the first was static my son uses these for gaming so the mic is really important the mic was exceptionally clear sound is great too very pleased especially for the price 
neutral,have had this item since march and now when scroll down using the roller it squeaks and is very annoying
positive,we have had several more than head sets this one has survived the longest it is used by yr old boy who takes care of it as well as yr old might 
positive,i ve had this for about year or two now and this thing is sick sound quality is amazing and couldn be happier didn want anything too small or too big and this is perfect for taking out and about it comes with sling but ve never used it before getting this speaker ve never owned jbl product and was somewhat apprehensive have the blue color because couldn find the green camo at some point like to get the next size up but for now this will work just fine ve seen jbl products range from and depending on what speaker it is would totally buy it because have fallen in love with the brand now bought this at my local best buy not on amazon 
positive,i really like how clear the game sounds with these headphones easy to talk with my friends seems like they are in the same room 
positive,so originally was introduced to jbl speakers when the charge first came out loved it and was immediately fan and remain to be fast forward to have been telling any and everyone come across that when ever in question go with jbl so this last christmas someone baught me the jbl flip and was just confused the sound quality the base even the bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song returned no problem only wanted replacement anyway received the second one and again like the jbl look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the charge so after getting refund from the second flip spent think it was an extra dollar and there it was the sound that made me fan to begin with if you re just trying out jbl speakers would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the charge models see that the flip and have almost perfect rating on amazon so maybe it just my opinion but believe the quantity all around of the charge is better representative of the jbl brand the battery in the charge seems to drain quicker than the flip but put my speaker threw it passes from the moment turn it on in the morning until am ready to relax in the evening literally have nothing negative to say about the bluetooth connection no problem at all the sound quality is just awesome love music period believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe or pushes of the button if you re listening to sax or blues guitar albert king for example it only gets better the higher you go garth brooks or lauren daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard man can wait till can get enough for the extreme or the boom box hope this was helpful to someone god bless
positive,i got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the pc so far her experience with it has been great the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she lefty the main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten plus for me 
positive,haven done many reviews but think this one was worth the time have hands that are bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area haven used the mouse for gaming but also haven had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too overall if you are looking for wireless mouse good for work and home use with good connectivity highly recommend this mouse 
positive,my daughter love it was birthday gift
neutral,not suitable for long term it broke after months 
positive,it sleek and there no clicking noise when pressing mouse buttons the optional lights on the mouse also helps me when studying at night will definitely buy more of these and recommend to my work staff excellent product at great price good job
positive,this is great keyboard except for the fact that the enter key is not wide enough the backslash key takes the place of where the first bit of the enter key should go will probably end up returning because don want to relearn how to type to make up for smaller enter key 
neutral,i found them to be kind of junky
positive,we love it 
positive,seems like good mouse so far good feel nice weight 
negative,one problem have with these is that the cord that plugs into my controller is so stiff with no flexibility that it wants to break 
neutral,i have had this for about week and haven had to charge it at all initial setup was breeze my primary use is for late night console gaming with limited or no ambient lighting the brightness is just right for my usage making the keys easy to see and use switching between consoles is also breese 
negative,decent while it worked though waking from sleep required switching it off back on underneath the laser stopped working fully charged up only color lights work making it useless 
neutral,it very slow at connecting that one clicks on sometimes you have to tap few times to get it to connect 
neutral,the wheel was broken the second day used it
positive,it nice looking and the wife absolutely loves it and it vibrant colors got her the mint green one and it works like champ didn like the feel of big flat mouse under my hand but she said that it isn problem and likes it so that the important thing 
negative,the sound isn as good as had hoped but the awful range of the bluetooth was the absolute deal breaker fully charged it can keep solid bluetooth connection to my computer that literally feet across the living room it breaks up so bad that it was unbearable to listen to wondering if the problem was actually my computer switched to little jbl clip that have and it worked flawlessly the charge was total failure and is being returned to best buy 
positive,has deep bass but wouldn mind bit more treble it sounds great outdoors and that without turning the volume all the way up did have some trouble setting up the stereo mode but figured it out we play this whenever we shower plus when we re getting ready and we charge it like every three weeks or so it only takes an hour or two to fully chargefor stereo mode pause the music and make sure only one speaker is connected via bluetooth press the connect button on both with the app open it ll show both speakers together and you can tap stereo below it it will not work if both speakers are connected via bluetooth it has to be just one and leave the other unpaired
positive,my son likes the headphones he said they are really comfortable and works with his laptop and game 
positive,hs grad gift she says she loves it great sound range and quality the one to have 
positive,now that an old man and don need anything super fancy for my desktop replaced deathadder from with it only been using it for about hours but no major complaints so far takes little bit of getting use to because it sits so low but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive 
neutral,quality headphones for the price 
positive,you never know when you buy something you ve never used before but this speaker is great bluetooth connects quickly sound is great and it plenty loud enough set it on my freezer in the back of the garage and it plenty loud enough and crisp 
positive,this is nice little mouse very quiet clicking and get lots of compliments on the changing color lights 
positive,super good quality microphone and headphones bought these to start streaming and the microphone only picks up my voice so don need to worry about background noise being picked up the headphones themselves are also really amazing crystal clear sound highly recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable and great quality headset 
positive,great speaker sound good
positive,so good for gaming the quality is so good highly recommend it 
neutral,i like the look and feel but the mechanic of using it are slime after week
positive,got it for family member they have been very happy with the keyboard battery life could last longer but is still good for night of gaming keyboard works while charging if you need to play for the full day and the on off switch really helps save power when you take break one problem to not is that keyboard remains on while changing even if you switch it off this is minor problem but could be larger issues for others 
neutral,sound quality is not very full thought this thing would be louder with more thump not impressed durable and battery life is great stars 
positive,my niece loves it 
neutral,huge lag from keyboard to computer will just stop working randomly you have to smash the keys down to get them to register the key stroke if they even register it at all 
neutral,the mouse itself was wonderful it installed within seconds and was very smooth operating it fit well in my small hand and there was no clicking noise wish it worked out as liked the mouse itself the only issue is not the mouse itself but my sensitivity to the led optical lights got migraine from it the led light can be turned off so that in itself could be remedied but the optical light which is bright red showed through the side lights the gap between the switches and the dpi option switch there was no way of blocking the light was really sad had to return it 
positive,good sound quality and comfortable to wear multiple options for connectivity accommodation and nice look 
positive,i love how the mouse changed colors and the set up was easy just plug and go the charging was easy as well
negative,i ve had the product for less than two months and it no longer works really disappointed

neutral,i love how this mouse looked and it didn hurt my hands unfortunately was able to only charge it and now it won recharge at all 
positive,use for gaming like that they reduce outside noise and surround sound is great 
positive,wish the colors were customizable other than that it looks and performs well 
negative,i ve had this mouse for almost months it worked so well and the color changing lights add little pizazz unfortunately the scroll wheel stopped working it no longer has tension on it it just spins now and moves nothing on the screen 
positive,excellent quality
neutral,good feel and ergonomics but scroll wheel broke at six weeks design plastic quality selection does not live up to common everyday use 
negative,i don even use it full shift and already broke very disappointed 
positive,my kid liked these headphones for his gaming system but really like them for doing my telehealth video sessions for work 
positive,i purchased for work and loved it until it got dropped from my desk 
negative,i bought this item few weeks ago and it was disappointing to find out the battery does not even last min at full volume but the worst part is that even if plugged to the charger the battery will die if speaker is in use which will cause for it to shut off 
positive,so glad purchased this for my business portable and amazing sound
neutral,broke in less than months scrolling won workwouldn recommendquit right outside the return window
positive,love the sound great as charge source too 
negative,this mouse was wonderful when it worked but it stopped after just over month it will not hold charge and is of no use now unfortunately the return window has passed would not suggest purchasing this item

positive,light weight fits hand perfectly
positive,cute color and lights works great 
positive,i purchased this maybe months ago and it worked great the battery life is really impressive barely ever had to charge it and am pretty hardcore pc gamer no noticeable latency and it goes between sleep and active mode seamlessly the full color rgb is definite nice touch also the keys have nice soft press feel to them very quiet if you are looking for very pronounced mechanical keystroke this is not that their customer service responds extremely fast and was refreshing to have such helpful people respond to message in the fashion they did will order from again in the future 
positive,listen to music from you tube good bluetooth speakers sound very good on the beaches quality is very good so far recommend for use anytime any were sounds good at beach and park buy it if you love music like like me new comment does not last hrs as stated dies after an hour of use was charging it every night still does not work after an hour

positive,head phones worked as promised they look great during zoom calls adds little flair to business meetings

positive,i absolutely love this speaker 
neutral,was great for gaming however completely died less than month after purchase had full charge and wouldn even turn on when connected to power stopped working while using the keyboard mid game no matter how good the product is not much use if it doesn work 
negative,the product lasts about minutes and dies have charged it so many times and it still needs to be plugged in to work even when plugged in it still only lasts another minutes seller is in violation of amazon terms of agreement continually contacting customer private email asking to remove review review is factual and customer will continue to report abuse to amazon through email community help com do not purchase product due to poor quality and unregulated customer service practices 
positive,last weekend took this speaker on floating trip down the river know it said it was waterproof but let me tell you our tube flipped over and the speaker was mia mins later we found it floating down the river picked it up and started playing music again was stunned awesome speaker 
positive,i like my charge so much just bought nd one keep one by my easy chair and one by my bed unplug it and keep it near me when do chores around the house or in the yard it sounds great and is easy to use 
positive,cute mouse just love how it lights up with the different colors 
positive,for headset around range it proved to be one of the best price performance set you can find at amazon 
neutral,the mic didn last very long until it started having problems also you can move the mic around so people can hear you 
positive,just great sound for such small speaker haven tested the waterproofness 
neutral,it was working fine at first always kept it charged but after few months it just completely stopped working when try to turn it on it just flashes red and turns itself off tried charging changing the usb ports and still nothing waste of money 
positive,broke in week very sad because bought it for my bf as gift trying to be the cook gf yeah failed but they look cute lol
neutral,i got brand new laptop everything is up to date yet when plug in the receiver it says it malfunctions when looking at devices it says driver error uninstalled re installed reset my computer multiple times do not get this 
neutral,speaker sounds very loud and powerful 
positive,like this mouse work good
positive,i love this keyboard
neutral,the mouse stopped working after week of purchase it did not respond to any movement cannot recommend it to someone else cheap product
neutral,they look cool at first glance but one plugged in the sound quality was alright on the left side barely audible on the right side the mic seems to be decent though will say that 
positive,it works feels and sounds like jbl should no complains about mono sound 
neutral,easy to use and lite weight will purchase another one soon
positive,great sound portability and battery life 
positive,a fantastic speaker for my laptop which use to watch movies can also have it in the rain but have not tested that yet good price excellent sound and the battery life is amazing 
neutral,this keyboard is very comfortable to use and the lights are not too bright love the layout of the colors it seems to be very quick response when playing games 
neutral,excelente
neutral,this product is useless and the quality is abysmal have never complained about any product purchased from amazon or through amazon in the last years as customer please inform all your customers that this product is cheap quality piece of damnation 
neutral,as soon as took this out of the box knew that was probably going to be sending it back it looks nice in the picture but it is piece of cheap plastic it felt so cheap that just couldn even use it sent it right back 
neutral,no instructions in english sleep mode no ideaworks fine and the color changing is cute
neutral,the rest of the mouse is fine but the scroll wheel no longer scrolls took just over month for it to break so can even return it now 
positive,when in doubt always look at the most recent reviews rather than most popular really wanted to like this keyboard it started off fine but then the battery would hold its charge less and less within month of owning it it needed to be plugged into the usb charger all of the time or else it would immediately lose its charge and turn off so now have functionally wired keyboard after trying to buy wireless one speaking of function the numpad keys do not work and the usb charging cable is ridiculously short have to use an extension cord just to use it on my standing desk the usb cable must be special because none of the other usb cables own work with it macbook oculus jabra even cable that specifically said it would work with this keyboard the rgb was one of the main reasons why bought this keyboard but it leaves lot to be desired it not that bright and isn dynamic when typing save your money unless you really want to spend for paper weight 
neutral,the headphones have really good sound quality
positive,i purchased this wireless mouse because needed one and cheap one was very impressed you don even need to use mousepad it works smoothly by itself 
positive,love how amazon is fast and product is great
positive,slik nice color same as photos love it also its actually wireless and no need battery some still one aaa battery even if its says wirless bought so many of this to my whole family
positive,works great charges up after about an hour for couple days use great mouse 
positive,my favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch the colors are great addition and add to the experience of using it it feels sleek as you move it on mousepad and all other surfaces and textures the customer service has been splendid they replaced mouse for me and helped answer questions when inquired about getting replacement usb receiver they were pleasure to communicate with no complaints
positive,the mouse is contained in japanese package but was made in china it comes with the type adapter charging usb cable regular usb mouse receiver and thin instructions ve plugged the type adapter into two different machines with the same result neither laptops read the type directly or through another adapter ve also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type with the same results none of them work through this adapter other than that issue the mouse works it also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again the also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included just plug in the charging cord into an empty usb slot the color changing around the rim of the mouse gives nice touch and although at first the mouse feels long due to it sleek shape it does fit comfortably in the hand it also has plastic like feeling and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn malfunction or break 
neutral,i started using this product exactly month ago it will not work now unless it plugged into the charger which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse can recommend 
positive, great price good quality wireless would be nice with better performance microphone 
positive,excellent speaker with great sound quality would recommend to someone who is looking for mid sized portable bluetooth speaker
negative,i bought this and after few months the center stopped working so cant scroll at all also it doesn click terrible product 
positive,i love the colors of the led lights and the sleek size of the mouse itself but you can use the feature of wireless because it won hold single charge ve had it charged for days now and it won work unplugged 
positive,cool item easy to set up very pretty 
neutral,pretty lights but when it sleeps you have to turn it off and wait ten seconds and turn it back on stopped working completely less than month after buying so now its light up paper weight
positive,love it
neutral,mouse is generic and seems like it worked couple of times then it was just never working good after that 
neutral,good sound quality and durable
positive,this mouse works well for my needs and fits in my medium sized hands well this is the first mouse ve ever owned with built in rechargeable battery and now don ever want to own one without it the small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go another nicely designed element is that the nano receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn require prying off cover or any extra effort to remove or insert 
positive,great product excellent seller thank you 
neutral,the mouse stopped working after week of purchase it did not respond to any movement cannot recommend it to someone else cheap product
positive,this mouse has been so much better on my wrists it sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist love the rechargeable aspect because no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements it is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away so many colors to choose from too 
negative,review after months use liked the mouse lot it was rechargeable cool with lights but it suddenly stopped working after months very disappointed 
neutral,i ordered this mouse because was tired of using my laptops track pad at school it arrived on time charges quickly has very satisfying and quiet mouse click sound and overall is great mouse for the price the only issue face is that the rgb on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well it doesn prevent the mouse from doing its job though and often find myself using the mouse with the rgb off anyway overall good mouse just don expect the rgb to work amazingly it is only after all 
neutral,it got keys
positive,i bought the jbl speaker may and have listened to it daily for hours the sound out of the box was waaay heavy on the base found sound mix app online and used the app to adjust the bass down for more realistic range it sounds good now for the impressive part perched it on the top of my shower enclosure listening to my fav pandora station when you guessed it the speaker dropped feet to the shower pan bounced good foot and landed getting drenched it was amazing never missed beat but it gets better didn learn from that experience and did the same thing again ops second foot fall bounced did four degree flips in the shower and keep on playing will definitely buy another one when destroy this one jbl sounds great and indestructible chris
positive,love the response time on the keys and how quiet it is
negative,i enjoyed using the mouse while it lasted but after months of light use the scroll wheel collapsed mouse is still responsive but scrolling no longer works which makes it practically useless to me 
positive,great purchase
positive,pretty good quality 
neutral,good response
neutral,good
negative,upon receiving the mouse charged it with the charging cable used it for considerable amount of time and plugged it in upon plugging it in there was an odd smell the smell was the cable starting to melt unplugged it and will not be using it again lucky that didn walk away or my place could have caught on fire what disappointment 
neutral,bought in january it april and it won charge so it useless 
neutral,if you re looking for wireless mouse keep looking this is not it the first one received didn charge so they sent me another one which started using at the beginning of july and now it doesn work anymore didn even last months with normal usage no gaming or anything such shame because actually liked it 
positive,got this because figured have better luck with connectivity while playing call of duty on the ps yet can be standing close to box and barely hear the sound of it let alone enemy footsteps yes have the sound at in the game settings and the volume dial turned all the way up sending it back for refund 
positive, wow not what expected literally went through lot of gaming headsets can honestly say they are legit these headphones speak for itself get them

neutral,bought in january it april and it won charge so it useless 
positive,great sound easy to use don know about battery yet 
positive,it an excellent keyboard the keys have great texture with very sense of comfort the layout is eu enter key so you ll uncomfortable until you get used it for while especially if you are using usa layout keyboard during the day 
positive,for its price the headset worked very well although the design is quite flimsy and the earpieces were bit too small the sound quality was very good and it worked as intended 
positive,good good good 
neutral,the plug to use in macbook does not work really needed this mouse so had to go out and buy plug myself spending more money for what this should have come with it working now but only because spent more money 
negative,got this product june it is august th and it no longer functions even when fully charged lasts less than days it beautiful but will end up being waste of money 
positive,so its bit to much base for the how much sound even with some movies think would he more like it but im cheap so idk its seems to be bit heavy on the positives decent battery good base durable havnt put it in water afraid too do to the cover being put back on looks to not go back on the way would like it to
positive,i listen to everything from podcasts to classical rock and metal on this speaker it has great full range including an impressive bass response the treble is pretty directional and the sound isn hi fi for critical listening very happy with the small size and portability can carry this thing around the house or back yard and have my music wherever go overall very satisfied 
positive,got this for my son for christmas he loves it for his xbox 
negative,the scroll wheel stopped working after month very frustrated 
negative,scroll wheel broke weeks into having it and stopped working not even months later 
negative,all the buttons are smooth but the space bar for some reason is loud and gets very annoying when you are typing sounds like it is loose 
neutral,nothing really to say it didn work with my macbook
neutral,used this mouse for week and the scroll roller is already broken 
positive,works great
positive,this keyboard is amazing the lighting is awesome and when not in use the lights turn off so not waating battery life typing is great and awesome for gaming 
negative,it broke the mouse is unresponsive the wheel is isolated it is inconvenient having to charge the mouse every few uses through cable it 
neutral,they do not work with an box one you have to buy adapter for them to work false advertising
positive,i ve been on the hunt for gaming headset for while now and stumbled across these what really caught my eye first was the price of these can beat that and secondly the led effect sold me tried these out and think they have great noise cancellation and love that you can adjust the volume of it and it also comes with multiple cords to connect with many different devices 
positive,worked great at first after about month the sensor stopped working too late to exchange or return now use this for work might be worth it to invest in something of better quality looks nice that about it 
positive,it very nice wireless mouse very quite the color is very nice too like it so much
positive,i bought this for my daughter and initially she said she loved it then she stopped using it and went back to her old mouse left my mouse at work and borrowed this one now know why she doesn use it it constantly disconnects and have to turn it on and off to get it to work then it randomly tracks on the screen when am not moving it it seems like someone else is controlling my computer unsettling this mouse is junk very pretty junk 
neutral,it was working fine at first always kept it charged but after few months it just completely stopped working when try to turn it on it just flashes red and turns itself off tried charging changing the usb ports and still nothing waste of money 
positive,the mic is easy to use and have good mic quality my friends say that they don hear any static or background noises the earpad are very comfortable on my ears though so if you have sensitive ears the headphones wont be an issues the sound is good quality which is need for games like apex and cod in conclusion good headphones for the price and will definitely buy again in the future 
positive,it was great to begin with for the price wasn expecting lot however the scroll wheel quit working within the first times of using it which is one of the reasons purchased it to begin with 
positive,fits my hand perfect like the lites and the sleep mode to save battery life 
negative,awful product you have to turn it on and off all throughout the day to get it to work horrible 
positive,i sucker for colors and needed new key board this one is it not only do like the colors in the background but the comfort and style it was great buy
positive,i am casual gamer this seems to be good product for the price 
neutral,i use this mouse for work and it holds up for hrs it doesn take long to charge and the changing colors is plus glad purchased
positive,won hold charge haven been able to use since ve got it cause it won turn on after multiple attempts
positive,great headset for the money
neutral,the pictures aren accurate it only lights up and changes as solid colors
positive,works well but the cord is very clunky these are stylish and easy to use but the cord is very thick and heavy which guess is good thing for durability but not necessarily for comfort do like the option of the volume control being on the cord but it is already so heavy enough that it is cumbersome 
positive,great sound portable good on beach 
positive,i use this mouse for basic tasks no gaming but like the fact that is rechargeable and seems to hold the charge long enough also like the silent mode so can work at night on bed without disturbing my wife 
neutral, stars for the weight
positive,cordless mouse is okay out of the box after few months of use it starting to wear out now have to start double clicking to make sure it responds to the icons click on colors are still great it great not having to change batteries it pretty much quite as far as clicking but as noted above it will still wear out sooner than expected 
positive,works excellent prefer this mouse over the apple one 
positive,my child uses this for gaming he very happy with it he picky about headsets and this one seems to work well enough for him without any complaints he able to chat with others while gaming and sound quality is good for him easy to use and no setup required for gaming on pc 
positive,i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the headphones for the price that they were they are very comfortable to wear and the mic is placed at good distance from your mouth so people can only hear you when you want them too not experienced enough in the gaming equipment world but the quality of sound is great for me too if you want cheap reliable headset would highly recommend this one 
neutral,i work from home and purchased this keyboard for my work computer prefer the backlit keys for work and usually the letters don wear off as quickly this worked great for about weeks and then it was no longer quiet keyboard my kids complain about how loud it is even rooms away and it misses keys when type or double types letter when pushed it once so if you like purchasing something that works for weeks and then sucks this is the keyboard for you otherwise keep shopping lol
positive,came fully charged out of the box used it to hours day delivering mail and packages when time and the route allowed sound quality is great for single speaker that is trying to be stereo speaker would like to buy another to link them for stereo but don need that right now bought the silicone or rubber thingy that is its protective case recommend it for obvious reasons but it really helps keep the damage down if you are going to use it in violent environment like postal carrier truck listening to xm or your playlists on your phone has very little effect on the battery used it to charge my phone once not bad but your phone isn gonna charge fast all in all would buy another one the sound quality is good enough to want to link of them together and btw they are waterproof to limit read the instructions not fan of the app kinda useless unless you want to link units or there is soft firm ware update 
positive,fits my hand perfectly the color changing lights are fun addition to every day boring mundane task the black mouse is sleek and soft love it
neutral,everyone says sound far away or in tunnel
neutral,product perfect this is upgrade for me operating instructions suck
negative,failed to work in months
negative,not the best
positive,i love this mouse the colors are beautiful and ve gotten many compliments on it it feels great to use as well took away one star because the charging cord stopping working about day after using it easily charges with any micro usb though it been couple months and still works being used every day at work 
neutral,got mouse for my son the light look cool and it was comfortable no complaints until the trackball quit working after about days contacted the company they communicated well and replaced it very quickly about week later the same thing happened again great communication and no issues with refund so good communication but not the best mouse 
neutral,stopped working months after got it
positive,i like how it is light weight and the sound quality is good
neutral,bought these for my husband he lovesss them he gaming experience is completely different now 
positive,i ll first mention that if you are buying this you probably don want to spend an arm and leg for gaming keyboard however you definitely get the most for what you pay for ve been using this keyboard for months now and though it isn as comfortable or bright as others it gets the job done don really care too much about the light features fading mode breathing mode but my biggest problem is the brightness of the light if the room is well lit you can definitely tell rgb is lit but its bit dimmer than expected at night was hoping to clearly see the major change in color between the keys on the keyboard but the keys do not allow lot of light through the transparent plastic on each key you can see the color very clearly between the keys but not so much for through each key the only improvement suggest would be to make the keyboard slightly less harsh on the hands after hours of typing and increasing the maximum brightness of the keyboard besides that the battery is fine for the price and you can still use the keyboard if the battery dies by plugging it in which is pretty convenient like said you get what you pay for and this is more than fine klim did pretty well and this keyboard has lasted me several months without any major issues 
positive,this system will not disappoint all of our family members own one and love it 
negative,barely worked for few hours and died
positive,this was great value and the wireless mouse works well the colors are fun too just wish it had way to keep it on one color 
positive,comfortable and easy to use the sleep feature is convenient because you do not need to charge as often 
neutral,color 
positive,i am just low key kinda gamer don have lot of money or fancy set up just fan for my gaming laptop and these they match which is really cool see photo have no complaints asked guy on roblox vc how sounded on scale from and he said if you are like me or have kids who also play games similar to me such as roblox or elite dangerous or just have general steam discord needs then would recommend this headset although its plastic it doesn feel low quality or cheap feels well made and sturdy ve dropped this think like times already and also stepped on and by mistake yanked on the cord it still working great though also the volume control and mic on and off buttons all work fine if you don game for living but want something that finally isnt junk but aren rich this in my opinion is your solution 
positive,great product very happy with it performance blue tooth connects flawlessly you can pump it up to strong loud sound clear and crisp
neutral,the mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy remove it from my laptop when it not in use and put it back under the mouse its pretty difficult to remove it again without some kind of sharp edge feel like it will eventually break 
positive,first and foremost it is exaclty as stated works charges lights up and connects to usb dongle out the box it is exaclty what you are paying for am using it on samasung galaxy pro expensive computer cheap mouse it works perfectly do have two concerns it cheap looks cheap and the color looks to me as it will fade in time second the dongle sticks out alot too much for my liking that said this computer doesn need mouse just wanted one for laziness purposes the product is as stated but cheap great for college student or travel mouse 
positive,so great for the price my son loves them 
positive,i bought this to play ffxiv on my ps and it works great no complaints 
neutral,its nice long lasting portable speaker 
neutral,so loved this and use computer daily so you could say it is only intended for rare usage it broke within the month was sad specifically the scrolling button 
neutral,the headphones stopped working correctly within month sound only in one ear 
positive,product as described looks great with the lights ordered twice 
negative,tried times using this in the week ve had it even checked to make sure it was fully charged turned it off on several times and no improvement movement of cursor is very slow delayed very disappointed with functionality went back to using my battery operated mouse 
positive,great headset for the money very pleased 
positive,this wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up the led lights gives it nice look and the click is silent the battery last day haven had to change them over all mouse
positive,awesome 
positive,very comfortable to use love it
neutral,i have to charge it every ten minutes of use charge it for hours and still only last ten minutes it really cute but not very functional 
positive,perfect for gaming watching shows on his kindle or listening to music 
neutral,worked great for about month and then the button stopped clicking properly or at all 
positive,i researched amazon for wireless mouse and found this one bought it to use with new laptop it works great it is responsive easy to use and saves me time tinkering with the laptops built in mouse another plus is no more batteries to buy happy to have this 
neutral,this speaker does not hold its charge and to top it off you can use it while charging have an anker speaker that was much cheaper and it actually works better had purchased the jlb for fathers day thinking it would be an upgrade for my husband but was proven wrong if the return window was still open would return it 
positive,won recharge lasted not even week 
neutral,really
neutral, the keyboard is nice and quiet and feels great to type on the achilles heel is the space bar arguably the most used key on the board produces cacophonous smack upon use all the keys are silent but the space bar just want to wake the neighbors it very distracting 
positive,my mother loved it
neutral,i had hbo products before always been satisfied
positive,love this mouse it so pretty to look at and it does the job 
neutral,the keys are very buggy in response takes hitting the keys several times in some instances for them to work keyboard goes into sleep mode seconds after you hit key so it is constantly turning off forcing you to jam the keys to get them to work again it is pretty and the company sends you cute emails after you buy it but just garbage product overall have had to buy new keyboard just days after purchasing this one as it id border line unusable
negative,i fully charged the mouse used once and then it quit working it will still light up but no mouse on the screen 
neutral,worked as soon as it was being used
neutral,it works well with my laptop for everyday work has glitched occasionally when ve got the laptop docked with multiple monitors for gaming which is frustrating for work highly recommendfor gaming not recommended
positive,great little mouse light weight and love the colorful lights and can turn off when not using to save charging power 
positive,my husband loves his pre fathers day speaker he plans to use when he is in his shop man cave sounded great he also liked how he could charge his phone while he listens to his music 
positive,my child loved them for his games 
neutral,i got to use it for one day better to get one from walmart 
positive,i like how the headset feels comfortable usually after hour of game play my ears start to hurt not with the new ones highly recommend would like to add the great customer service too 
neutral,pretty easy to use and set up comes with charger expected the lights to be bit more appealing but they re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain probably wouldn use for gaming purposes though 
positive,there really isn anything to dislike about this mouse the setup process is virtually non existent you just plug in the usb and you re good to go have been using it for more than week and haven had to charge it yet the light display is neat added bonus great for dark room adventures long story short it does what expected but better great buy 
positive,this is great for beginner gamers the headset is comfy which is important because we use it for hours and hate when headsets gives headaches from the pressure it does cancel outside noise pretty well but you can still hear bit which prefer since would like to know if being spoken to when playing but you have to take headsets off to actually hear other people in the room like that you can use in the pc and ps because the headset jack works with the ps remotes like others mentioned the usb has to be connected to light up for us we don mind the light not being lit up so it not big issue after all when you are the user you really don look at yourself unless you are streaming live with face view and you want that extra flare only issue had which isn big issue is the mute for the mic isn easily accessible and the switch is sometimes hard to quickly use when gaming for those times when you want to be muted so others don hear every background noise or family talking so find myself trying to switch between mute while playing which is hard when you are playing fps games and in an intense section but that might be me not able to multitask that quickly lol just wished the mute button was button possibly or the slide switch it does has was higher up the flush so you aren stumbling trying to slide plus it doesn really feel like it slides all the way so you are double checking know went into depth of the issue but it isn huge issue just my input maybe when they decide to make another model they can put that into consideration overall love it going to buy couple more for our gaming family 
neutral,i bought this for gaming with friends on ps and for the first few days it worked fine but after that the sound quality just got really bad and it started noticing some of the flaws which just proved to me how cheaply made they were if you don mind that they ll be alright for the price but for me and many others it ll hardly be worth it 
negative,i had this mouse before without the led lights worked like charm but despite this version that says the led lights are able to turn off they don the switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work the on button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights so basically stuck with annoying flashing lights 
positive,out of the box couldn get this mouse to connect with my macbook pro gave up after min of trying then tried again in couple days now it does connect but its unusable the mouse moves mm on my screen for huge amount of movement and yes checked the tracking speed in my settings clicking on anything takes about tries and scrolling is impossible upset by the deceitful overall rating of this mouse swear there are bots falsely giving this mouse good ratings 
neutral,came fast no set up required just plug in and go the kids in my classroom love the light up feature 
positive,this headset is comfortable however the mic has static noise 
positive,the volume is not to low was expecting better sound
positive,i use this product for online gaming extremely happy bought the headset now can communicate and hear other players 
positive,i like the simplicity and sleekness of this mouse along with the changing colors everything works fine so far 
neutral,small mouse but no batteries 
positive,great for gaming noise cancellation 
positive,needed quality headset for good price works great 
positive,sound quality is excellent great bass sound too connects instantly to my iphone battery life is amazing use it few hours almost every day and it lasts the whole week 
positive,the good part about it is very convenient and it saves lot in batteries and you can still use it when charging to the laptop also the lights lets you know when is time to charge it like it lot
positive,when bought this mouse really liked it it felt nice worked well on consistent basis and the colors give my desk pretty touch it was cheap so guess you can expect it to last but was hoping to get at least year after months of light daily use it doesn want to charge even if leave it plugged in all night in the morning it barely has any charge this is decent mouse if you don mind having to buy new one couple of times year but going to just spend little more and get one that is hopefully better quality 
neutral,i don dislike anything bought it to play music esp when leave the house but since not leaving playing on the patio and basement 
positive,this mouse is just right to fit my hand light weight pretty lights 
positive,great mouse bought second one to take to work
neutral,do not buy it this mouse stopped working they built it enough to last few months so it out of amazon return policy after that it doesn work 
neutral,when they worked they were great but the randomly stopped working about one year after purchasing
neutral,i wasted my money on buying two of these wireless led mouse they literally only lasted one week charged them the only activity is prompt red flashing light purchased high end well name brand wireless mouse 
positive,been using for while and are pretty alright 
neutral,i love it when first got it but now it has stopped working 
positive,perfect mouse for my laptop thin and easily stored it tracks great and fits into my hands very comfortably sleep mode prevents battery drainage if forget to turn it off after use highly recommend 
neutral,repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight searched for power issue reviews and found am not the only one cannot recommend this product and feel it should be taken down due to this 
positive,for the price this object is probably my favorite keyboard have ever had it response great has had no issues using plug playing in different laptops plugs in and gets to working quickly so far have only charged it couple hours two separate times and have been using it for constantly playing games since bought it month or more ago so my battery life in my personal experience with this has been amazing recommend this product it is built much much better that the few other klim products have tested out well worth the money that is my two cents you do your research decide 
positive,it good headset comfortable nice volume control on the cable cable is nice long length 
positive,i love this headset it very good for music and gaming even if it only seems to support standard sony controllers so couldn use my custom controller with it but it no big deal it still lets you hear things you just couldn use the mic since you didn come through but the sound quality was really good and crisp especially when it comes down to bass it was perfect tldr great as long as you have sony brand controller and nothing aftermarket 
neutral,good in battery saving automatically gets in sleep mode if not used this saves battery 
neutral,loved everything about this mouse until the charging jack came loose after three months of use there is no way to charge it now guess you get what you pay for 
positive,bought it as gift and it was well received 
positive,bought it for my son great headset 
neutral,good if you want wireless mouse that works for months otherwise buy something else 
neutral,my son say it block noise
positive,amazing sound 
positive,good quality and nice look
positive,i love this keyboard so far awesome colors great ergonomics really good for gaming as well my one complaint is the position of the enter key could be little closer to the pinky other than that this is the perfect keyboard 
neutral,the scrolling wheel is already broken and havent even used the mouse for month 
neutral,much better sound than phone listening to tunes while golfing
positive,great sound love it
neutral, save your money what cheap speaker 
neutral,they are the worst the sound is ok but mic does not work it sounds like you are underwater when using them 
positive,i love this speaker it really awesome it loud it cute the only thing don like is the fact that haven had it for very long and the fabric is dingey keep it in my case when not in use and it barely gets touched just moved from one spot to another if anything ve tried wet cloths and all that but it just weird uncleanable material 
positive,very good headphone for the price good sound quality and the mic is also very nice very satisfied 
positive,we use it for the workshop environment handymen artisans and similar workers often hear music or podcasts and this is really useful when your only other option is using phone speaker however it still small portable device and you can still look for something else if you re searching for the perfect audio experience home stereo is more suitable if you don move around to much or if it not hassle to load and setup home stereo every time you leave the workshop to work somewhere else very impressed with the sound coming from this liter sized device and taking it on planes or road trips is really what makes it so good 
neutral,bluetooth connection very fast 
positive,great for gaming 
neutral,gaming
negative,there is literally an extra key between the and the enter key the is before the enter key guess if was more of gamer maybe this would make sense but since want to type more this is terrible why would you change keyboard layout 
positive,worked good for the first months used the mouse on security camera hard drive to review camera footage worked fine one time and after that no cursor icon appeared tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available it won select anything only right click works but can scroll to selection luckily my desktop is touch screen so manually opened up the drives properties and it said that all device functions are working properly clearly not being able to see cursor is an issue 
positive,i haven had any issues at all using this mouse it feels great the silent clicks and led lights add really cool touch to it as well 
positive,great sound and battery life
neutral,the mouse functions well however after few days noticed that the multicolor lights no longer changes hope to find some way to fix it 
positive,this jbl is great when sitting around the campfire 
neutral,wish it was little louder expecteda lot more from james lancing
positive,if you are buying this most probably you have done your research and for me it lives up to its expectation the speaker delivers deep bass for something of its size and is loud enough to fill large room if you want to use it outdoors it will definitely get the neighbors wondering if you re having party it gets pretty loud without getting distorted and at around is when there is sound distortion great for movie night in bed and for listening to music having owned the flip twice this is definitely an upgrade especially with its charging but wish it had strap or handle like the bigger and smaller versions of this speaker and wish it had microphone sometimes but also understand why they didn include it on here 
positive,worth every penny sounds great
positive,love this it so cool
positive,i use this with my desk top mac like it way better than the glass apple mouse can actually utilize more features with it too on the right click glides easy and have had no problems with it which is more than can say for the apple mouse years with apple products which love but their mouse is crappy design looks good but who cares this one is reasonably priced great price actually for what you get give this mouse two thumbs up 
negative,they lied there no led light on it they sound horrible there is no bass only one side of the headset works paid too much money for this the garbage would never buy anything again 
positive,simple book up and very responsive sturdy construction beautiful light display and worth every penny just as good if not better than the more expensive brands 
positive,beautiful fast shipping
neutral,mouse wheel doesn work
neutral,i like this mouse however after one week of use the scroll wheel broke 
positive,one of the better headsets out there for good price 
neutral,don buy scroll not working
positive,got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn work light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn work figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work mouse was doing great until found issue with its sleep mode when the mouse falls asleep to save battery it wakes up very quickly however from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed it ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem so the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible have to turn it on and off as needed 
positive,this is our second charge so we can have stereo awesome sound for the size and great battery life 
neutral,the roller stopped working
positive,best headphones for your money work great 
positive,great packaging quick and efficient shipping and came in great condition good bang for your buck highly recommend 
positive,i love this mouse if you have smaller hands or like mouse that doesn feel to big in your hands then this is for you the color and lights are cool touch as well 
neutral,long lasting power recharges fast
positive,this thing works well most of the time if you don turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode it dies fairly quickly but you still get couple of days of use out of it if you re not using it hours day at least if you turn it off every time you re done though you can get probably month but at least weeks out of it with moderate use originally bought it to use with my ipad however the case on my ipad wouldn really allow the usb to plug into the charger port wish they made an option to get either usb or usb plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter which makes the usb plug significantly thicker than necessary now use it for my macbook just warning if you want it to scroll like regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer but that macbook problem not problem with this mouse not all of apple setting decisions make sense but that nothing new do really like that can chose to just turn on the mouse with solid red color which preserves battery or turn it on to change colors reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is cool feature my only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn tracking perfectly and the cursor is in completely different place than would expect it to be further behind where was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing but that may also be thing have to change on the laptop 
positive,definitely recommend this bluetooth speaker connects quick and great sound
neutral,the mic doesn even work and there no noise cancelation the mic didn work the first day the audio started cutting out on the second day
negative,very cheap plastic and horrible mic not usable returning 
positive,i love this color changing wireless mouse colorful person so recognize colors before recognizing plain black and white as an educator my office is colorful and my classroom was colorful too love it 
neutral,after weeks it just completely stopped working tried different chargers and nothing it was good price and loved the lights but should have just grabbed one from the dollar store if this is the quality of the product 
positive,love it 
positive,overall the keyboard is good it smaller than expected but overall is good ve had it for about months and the windows buttons isn working anymore 
positive,this is the coolest mouse ve ever had sleek modern high tech and sexy lights everything slips in my briefcase with my new ultra thin laptop sweet 
positive,battery life is amazing you won regret it
neutral,nice keyboard unfortunately does not work well with xbox one input lag when using on xbox makes it unusable 
positive,great sound
positive,meets my needs and really enjoy it goes into sleep mode when not in use 
positive,great speaker lasts about hours on full volume
negative,i really liked the keyboard used it for work and some gaming but it died on me few weeks later 
positive,i like the how the headphones sound is good the noise canceling is good but you can hear other people drpending on how loud its very comfortable ur ears wont hurt after hours of use 
negative,i was looked forward to having this mouse but used about twice since got and it not working already don know if it defective or what guess there go my

positive,great size sound quality and purchase 
positive,i love the size of the mouse and it is so smooth really like this the design is great on the hand would recommend this mouse 
neutral,easy to use and light
neutral,i bought this before christmas for my husband and he started using it on christmas it is now february and the battery just now finally died he uses it every night and it took over months for the battery to die the sound is amazing and it connects perfectly 
negative,worthless to spend min trouble shooting every time need to use it 
neutral,it no for me 
neutral,not sure if the one got was just defective but the tracker did not seem to work very well as an analyst need something with smooth path and this mouse started stopped very abruptly had to return it 
neutral,i have purchased two of these keyboards and both have extremely loud spacebars have tried greasing the key among other things and it does not resolve the issue other than that like the keyboard 
negative,i purchased this mouse on march all of sudden the mouse just don want to move in the directions need it to each time move the mouse to different templates or screens it move then pause then move little and pause again would not recommend the mouse to anyone worst mouse ve ever purchased 
neutral,broke within week of having it 
neutral,originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries tried using this mouse for about week when finished using it forgot to plug it in so the next time tried to use it the power was zapped that pretty much defeats the purpose of having cordless mouse with no power had to use it when plugged into my laptop sent it back and got mouse that requires on battery 
positive,very easy to set up works perfectly fine with my macbook air 
negative,i ve had this mouse for about two months or less it does not work will charge but only hold bit of power for about minutes and die 
neutral,quiet and just what was looking for
neutral,trash for ps doesn even fit all the way in to the controller and you might be wondering why are plunging it into the controller cause the damn thing for the ps for itself doesn event work
positive,i bought these for my year old son who is gamer and he loves them he told me that they are comfy sound great and look cool love how sturdy they feel too definitely well worth buy 
positive, this is just below better than the spent on another headset do use the lights but enjoy the option mute button and control volume cancels out like surrounding noises which also enjoy because don like to be completely clueless to my surroundings comfy headset compared to the universal elastic ones other designs have
neutral,right button defective after month usage 
positive,my daughter loves these for gaming with her xbox one she likes the idea they light up and they have never given her any issues no she is able to connect and play with friends
negative,sucks broke in month
neutral,for gaming
positive,easy to use and easy to connect workes great with my laptop 
neutral,the first day received the product it worked very well though couldn get seem to get it to charge it had enough juice to get through the first day so wasn too concerned by the second day though something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn move the cursor and never moved it as fast as it should the buttons all seem to work fine still but without the ability to actually move the mouse as want to it pretty useless 
positive,you can turn off the colors it lights up the entire time you re using it bought the white mouse of this brand and love that one
positive,overall my son is very satisfied with his headphones he uses the with his nintendo switch and the sound quality is very good for the budget price these headphones go for the microphone is average so nothing special the lights look neat and they are very comfortable if you re looking for budget pair of gaming headphones would recommend 
neutral,does not work at all lights come on but it doesn connect to dongle and does nothing 
neutral,this mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given as is typical of many amazon products this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future and strongly suggest not buying this mouse unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don work is past time of yours then knock yourself out 
positive, the keyboard is fantastic
positive, what you see is what you get great buy would recommended
neutral,for the price it should be much louder 
positive,easy to connect great sound very portable long battery life what more could you ask for 
positive,so far so good great keyboard 
positive,really like this mouse never thought say that it stores the usb port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces it quiet click which appreciate even when working alone and the rainbow lighting is optional win win win it light too as it rechargeable carry it with my laptop and it made working on the go better
neutral,works great but the mic was kinda flimsy 
positive,my grandson loves this he says it works great he is gamer so he loves the lights and feel of the keys told great price value gift
positive,we love this speaker and use it daily at the pool the sound is awesome and hard to believe from such small speaker 
negative,i don typically write reviews but keep having this issue with tech products from amazon the mouse stopped working after months of use it charges and sometimes can get short term use out of it but it very glitchy and lags across the screen 
neutral,no complaints
neutral,the metal casing for the usb remote came off and is now stuck in the usb port of my computer
negative,had this head set for months and the sound started cutting out really bad on it
positive,i like the silent clicking and the smoothness and the ergonomic design but the wheel doesn scroll anything on the computer the wheel will move but won scroll anything on the screen 
positive,purchased for my son and he really enjoys using them he said the quality is really good very good price for gaming headphones 
positive, great mouse the best for the price 
positive,easy to use and charge works with my chrome book any special effort plugged it in it works
positive,i like to use keyboard with my laptop and this is good value like it 
negative,purchased this item in may of this year quit working will not charge amazon would not refund full amount charging me an restocking fee very disappointed in amazon for not helping loyal customer 
positive,i just received it and am excited to use it bought it for my remote work not using it for any gaming stuff already like it it soft and the cushioned headphones are comforting my ears like the color too the price for this color is ridiculously good 
positive,feels like you can turn it up loud enough for some games could be decibel limiter the bass is usually overpowered but not terrible product treble is good quality but bit on the quiet side 
neutral,my mouse worked for months and on the third month it wasn scrolling anymore and the mouse itself was just falling apart don spend you money on this item 
positive,the headset works great and looks awesome 
positive,great mouse definitely got my money worth
positive,i love them it sounds great when use it on my xbox or on my cell phone 
negative,i bought this for my year old son now he not the most careful but these things broke within month would not recommend for kids but if you treat them right now you shouldn have problem 
neutral,bought these for my grandson and he uses them for gaming and school 
positive,best speaker out
positive,i bought it for my daughter and she loved it this mouse is very light well designed and easy to use light up is also very nice feature 
neutral,i ve had this device for about months brought for my kids distance learning no issues so far charge the device at least once week
positive,battery last great for kid to use 
positive,the audio quality and fit are pretty nice however key feature needed was mic built into the headset the gain on the mic is maybe making it completely inaudible loud blowing into the mic brings it up to an audible level on playback but far from normal interaction when conversing will continue to use my very old logitech mic which is far superior in audio capture 
positive,i got this for my son for his birthday and we are very pleased with the quality and this price point you can beat it great product 
negative,the usb plug in is not long enough to connect to the playstation the cord is so long but splits into two six inch cords one goes into the playstation the other goes into the controller what the hell are you supposed to do
positive,i love the ease of use with this mouse the ability to charge it rather than constantly replace batteries and to shut off or put to sleep the noise it durable and perfect for my usage and was able to get it in pink 
negative,i purchased this on dec just about month ve been using it just quit working today turned off and back on and restarted computer still doesn work so not happy got only month out of it and it stopped working 
negative,i purchased this headset for my son for christmas it seemed to work fine for around months but as of now the mic no longer works how friends can hear him he can hear anyone else so he can no longer even use them total waste of money 
positive,i love this wireless mouse the lights are great and easy to assemble if you need wireless mouse for your laptop get this 
neutral,no dislike love it
positive,great item kids love it
positive,awesome
neutral,microphone doesnt work
positive,i think this is great price quality product
positive,sound quality is great 
neutral,bought the item and scroll button and left button stopped working after about months of use
neutral,great quality got them while on sale but knowing their quality would have paid full price
negative,don waste your money stopped working after days of use doesn hold charger either 
positive,this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used the flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use the colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive if you plan to use it with desktop computer be aware that the charging cord is very short so using the mouse while charging may be problem use it with laptop where this is not an obstacle the mouse appears very well made and sturdy 
positive,you get what you pay for if you just need quick mouse on the go so you don need touch pad this is great enduring use of everyday mouse spend the money for one that is lightweight ventilated ergonomic or combination this one soft clicks decent feedback good battery just not super high quality for the desk job
positive,my son enjoyed the design 
positive,bought it for my daughter for christmas and she loves it the sound is amazing and perfect size to take with her to college 
positive,i am old school when it comes to navigating the screen work much faster with wireless mouse everything about this mouse is great except you gotta to charge it mouse that require batteries work for very long time months in fact the charge on this mouse doesn last long have to remember to turn it off when not using it also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use starts acting sluggish as power runs down my old mouse is years old wanted cool new one to match my new laptop this one has soft smooth click the led lights are really fun however threw away the box before tried it out would send it back if had kept shipping material ll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging so much for progress i
positive,i did like the concept of wireless back light keyboard the key feel was not bad my grievance is the wireless receiver stopped working about days after purchase 
neutral,mouse is pretty solid all around except about day after started using it the wheel started squeaking figure it might go away in time nope months later still squeaking and getting more irritating by the day working in an quiet office it is loud enough that other people can hear it 
neutral,the keyboard looks and feels great but the issue is that at times while typing or using any keys really it just stops responding for good while this has lead me to charge it until the indicator turns off fully charged and it still does this ve turned off the wireless and connected via usb and this still happens so ultimately would not recommend this because you kinda need to use all the keys at all times 
negative,we purchased this product because we heard good things about it however the battery stopped taking charge after about months we filed warranty claim and after many emails and several hours of our time sorting things out we were told there was nothing they could do because the item was manufactured the prior year and they do not go by the date of purchase ridiculous the offered coupon to buy something else from them but obviously we will not be buying their products in the future very disappointed 
neutral,so far no complaints
positive,good quality comfortable fit great sound
positive,comfortable to use
negative,cheaply made usb port is so poorly made it does not fit in port which makes the mouse worthless for use with my surface mouse does not feel comfortable in hand just pass on this one

neutral,wired set up 
neutral,this is the rd set ve had to purchase for my son in the last year we kept buying the cheap headsets and they would all last couple months before the mic would quit working or the audio quality became really bad finally broke down and bought him nicer more expensive set and so far they are amazing at the quality and tech that is in those things

positive,the wife loves it we use it for the camera system
neutral,the mouse didn track well and kept freezing and then my laptop shut down within seconds of plugging the adapter in would avoid this one 
neutral,the headset is as advertised 
positive,i am fan on jelly bean type of mouse had previous jelly bean mouse that ended up giving to family member and was searching for another one to replace it and came across this one the lights is the one that did the trick for me here just love the lights other than that its nice light mouse could have been little shorter its longer mouse compared to my previous one but other than that very functional and light and can be carried in the pockets to meetings in offices which is what do primarily with this one

neutral,ergonomically find it to be too short and bit uncomfortable bought it as travel mouse so could over look that except that it barely works every time have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again 
positive,i love the sleekness
positive,i use it for work time keeping and it does everything need it to light for caps lock ease of inputting shortcuts comfortable for typing since it has two stands in the back lights up so can see the keys when don feel like turning on the lights in my office great product

neutral,i loved this keyboard but after after maybe year of owning it it doesn hold charge and doesn worked when plugged in very bummed 
neutral,very smooth and quiet 
neutral,was happy at first to see the design of the product but came to realize if type to quickly the keyboard my miss the key letter you put in it kept happening then got my wireless work one and realize don miss beat the klim keyboard have seems to not be able to read at fat pace when typing that comes to me as big issue 
neutral,the mouse is cute and work but do feel like there is some delay especially when im working between monitors ve been using this mouse for little over month now and the right click just broke randomly so theres that

positive,first one sold me great sound easy connectivity great look 
positive,it wireless but not bluetooth very misleading as it was recommended with the other mice that was total waste of money but fits nicely in your palm with small hands 
neutral,bluetooth connection of the speaker is very annoying it gets disconnected often times and also delivery of the music is slow 
neutral,we tried several different ways to charge it and it would not hold charge over minutes 
positive,great sound easy to used 
positive,thought these were good deal volume out works great however the mic is an out of box failure no one can hear me at all tried on pc and xbox my old headset the cord was chewed in half by our cat held the wires together on our old set and people could hear me better than with this set do not buy 
positive,cute color and lights works great 
positive,works fine but it feels like toy kid would use super light and made with thin cheap plastic
neutral,at first it worked perfectly fine then notice the movements on my pc screen became slow and laggy then it finally did waste of time and money 
positive,sound is clear and definitely cuts down the noise of my youngens running around lol exactly as described 
neutral,size is just right for me
negative,not sure why my mice will run charge for several days on single triple battery but this keyboard dies within days of being unplugged basically leave it plugged in all the time now which defeats the purpose of wireless keyboard 
neutral,light weight
positive,really good headset for the price fits well and isn uncomfortable definitely something would purchase again it also has nice sleek look to it 
neutral,product didn work
positive,mouse is really good for the price smooth and easy to use also the rbg lighting looks perfect with my setup 
neutral,i have had this mouse for all of minutes and am planning on returning it honestly it looks nice and like that it rechargable however it easily one of the worst ve ever used ve used probably different models in my career alone first clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse ve used and on top of that it very inconsistent looking through the gaps where the leds show out of can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is tiny plastic arm no chance that will lasts for an expected period of time it seemed to have been packaged fine so don believe it was damaged or doa don buy this 
positive,i use this mouse when travel it is great to haul around when on the go the small form lets it easily slip in to my backpack and the dongle holder on the mouse makes the set up and tear down quick and easy if you are looking for mouse to use for light work while on the road this is good choice 
positive,there is so much to say about this bought this for my mom and she loves it it has nice design nice feel to it and works beautifully well worth the money spent thumbs up 
negative,stopped working stopped chargi stopped lighting up contacted customer service and they sent out replacement that showed up days late new one we shall see 
positive,super quiet you just don hear any clicks love that it is rechargeable instead of replacing batteries have had it for weeks and have only charged it twice 
positive,i love this speaker my dad has one and uses it outside while barbecuing and love the sound quality had to get my own and so far it has not disappointed 
positive,my grandson is and blocks us all out now lol he loves playing with his cousins and uncle in indiana there great gaming headset for him thank you 
positive,it cool mouse but don think it worth the price whenever use it my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use it not my computer fault because switched mouses and the other one works fine also the color changing lights are see through from the top got white one and it kind of ruins the feel it just feels really cheap honestly though if it was maybe cheaper and it didn glitch the curser say it worth it like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries and like how it comes with lightning usb adapter 
positive,i had my last one for years ended up breaking it but got another one and honestly for the price and how long it lasted as well as quality it definitely worth while buy gifted one to my little brother use this on my xbox and little brother uses it on his ps or pc we never have any issues 
positive,this mouse is more comfortable than my older model it accurate and quick when use it the sleep mode works great and it holds charge longer than expected it would so far it works as it should and the colors are cute feature 
positive,it good very good sure there are better out there but got it for like dollars and this might be competition for the very expensive ones
neutral,lasted about week
neutral,little heavy is my only complaint otherwise very nice
neutral,smooth glide
positive,i bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break to be honest loved this mouse at first the lights the feel everything however was not fan of the extra added adapter to make it usb compatible here am months after bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well for some reason the companies that make these portable mouse mice cannot make one that has sturdy mouse wheel oddly enough the one thing didn like about the mouse originally became my favorite thing now that it is broken the adapter to allow me to run regular usb on usb port 
positive,it works well and easy to use
neutral,the mouse was perfect for travel then my wheel just stopped working months ago the mouse is not even year old 
positive,i love every bit of this headset it has the capabilities of being used on any device they have the best mic quality have ever seen the mic is bit close to your face but it is still perfect 
positive,my son loves this and think every kid that games should have one works great
positive,i got pair for my sons birthday and he really loves them 
neutral,didn work would not charge
neutral,product came in good box along with humorous company statement however everything afterwards was dismay the wireless keyboards has lot of lag the simplest way to describe it is pretty decent gamer and getting owned by noobs because of this system don even get me started on just using it for daily mundane tasks check and write emails the system would lag so much that would rather write whole essay in my cellphone and send it that way 
positive,love my jbl can take with me anywhere 
positive,i not the greatest at typing numbers thought this would be good night time solution to see the number buttons but the light is too dim as well as the numbers printed too small on the keyboard found the battery life lacking as well 
positive,bought it in march and now the roller thing does not work mouse was never dropped opened and found that the attachment of the roller is broken it works as intended and love that it is rechargeable ll buy another one if it lasts long enough then maybe the first one is just fluke 
neutral,iy works so what can one say about mouse 
neutral,its cool 
neutral,just go to your local department store when opened the package and inspected the mouse it had obvious scratches and looked like there was some wear on the bottom it works and gets the job done bought this mouse because was tired of buying batteries for another wireless mouse the mouse will not work when you have it plugged into the computer to charge 
positive,the perfect cute little mouse update had this mouse for little less than month which was so perfect and then stopped working definitely wasted my money 
neutral,i really liked the mouse but it broke after few months it does not follow my commands eg copy and paste 
positive,excellent very satisfied with this buy 
positive,standard wireless mouse works well what really like about it is the colored light at the sides 
positive,love the jbl charge only complaint is you have to be careful which one you buy if you want to pair them together charge and charge will not pair together besides for what need in the warehouse the charge is great 
positive,they look awsome and worked great for month thats it wish they had kept working because liked the look of it it was present bought for my husband
positive,nice bass but not in stereo looks like it had two speakers but no cost too high maybe for this trade off to be worthwhile sorry 
neutral,very quiet nice lighting

positive,great mouse speak design no clicking noises really pretty and easy to use 
positive,i have had it for almost month and it sounds great was nervous because other reviews stated that what they received was not real well this one was and it sounds great plenty of sound to do the job charges quick and is very portable 
neutral,mono not stereo 
positive,great sound quality headphones for gaming can hear everything in the game super clear noise cancelation from outside noised would definitely recommend these headphones 
neutral,mic wore out after month of use bummer
neutral,you can beat this price you get sounds for cheap the mic is little weak but it works
neutral,i needed this for work rechargeable nice looking easy to use but broke after weeks
negative,the center scroll wheel broke in weeks for no reason mouse was not dropped and barely used garbage so you get what you pay for 
neutral,mouse works lgb died almost immediately the only color actively working on this mouse is the red led and the blue when charging when the mouse is left idle for minute or two it seems to desync and takes minute to wake up it gets in the way more often than not otherwise okay product 
positive,really slick aerodynamic mouse fits in your hand perfectly love the different blinking colors also comes with rechargeable batteries all you have to do plug into available slot on your computer and you are ready to go highly recommend 
positive,great gaming headset perfect noise cancellation and the sound quality is perfect
neutral,no problems as of yet
neutral,this is quick responsive and easy to use mouse it can be run normally or with it built in lights sleeps after short period of unuse but wakes with single click micro usb charging cable included charges the mouse in no time light is on when charging and turns off when done with the sleep mode the battery lasts longer than expected 
positive,after few months the connecter is picky if it wants to work or not was great when it worked perfectly but with unplugging and plugging in it has gotten weak and no longer likes to work would recommend if you don have kids that like to play with your gaming set up lmao
neutral,nothing
positive,great product for the price the sound quality is actually really good and the headset sits on the head very comfortably 
positive,came in timely manner and sound awesome very comfortable
positive,worked good at first now after only very little use in two months time it won take charge would definitely stay away fro this product
neutral,worked for single week before it stopped typing 
negative,i ordered of these for our new macbook computers we got for christmasmy granddaughters broke after only couple of uses mine finally tried setting up last week after being on holiday and it doesn even work return windows are closed so they will make its way to trashdonnot but this items they are cheap and waste 
neutral,my husband bought of these in different colors for our children for school last month yesterday was the first day for our youngest the mouse did great no problem the second was dead since our daughter likes colors so we placed it on the charger last night and it still charging unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge no charge at all so now have to explain to my yr old that the company gave her broken mouse and try to find way to to get it work with her device while always charging should of just went to target 
positive,i bought this keyboard to replace my old one because my daughter spilt her drink on it this keyboard has worked out perfectly it keeps long charge and is easy to move around have my home office set up at the kitchen table my daughter also uses it for school love that it is not too bright but lights up just enough to see the keys when needed would recommend this to anyone with kids and those who needs to move around their work area frequently 
positive,this was pandemic lockdown buy my wife and were spending lot of time outside on our patio our happy hours were missing something great sounds this speaker delivers great sound at low mid and high range it can also play very loud although we keep the volume pretty low to be respectful of our neighbors would recommend this speaker to friend 
positive,love the quietness and how light it is
neutral,design
positive,good pricing for what they offer extremely happy with this keyboard 
positive,bought this for family member and decided wanted one as well worked like cha for both of us also lo the way it sounds 
neutral,when bought this mouse loved it it took me few tries to get it paired right but it is game changer for my laptop the rechargeable battery life on it is great found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly that it was time to charge it purchased it late september and at the end of april my roller has stopped working randomly it worked and then went to use it an hour later and it no longer does the scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop disappointed 
neutral,i purchased this item for macbookpro but it does not work as promised tried to return but dhl will charge me usd and amazon only cover usd so resigne to return

positive,good for kids gaming experience with good price
positive,needed wireless mouse for work laptop and this mouse gets the job done the price is very affordable and the product came very fast was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the clicking sound that should come in handy during the early mornings work days would recommend this mouse if anyone is trying to find something for their macbook usb port 
neutral,pleased overall with the exception that the volume control doesn work with my mac desktop
positive,it really nice everyday mouse the sleep mode is little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn seem to be way to change it don think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing but it great for office use 
negative,the scroller broke and only used it about times in total the rest of the time it sits in my bag the lights are dim don like how small it is it does not have the best tracking the clicking is louder than expected it also just feels cheap would not buy it if could do it again go for more quality one somewhere else 
positive,the wireless mouse with the usc and size adapter is perfect the led lights are great addition 
neutral,adfsadfasfdasdf
neutral,the sound that comes out of this thing is incredible we use it indoors and outdoors never had an issue and would def buy again 
neutral,mouse is nice and lightweight and quiet but its lags and jumps around sometimes
positive,does not hold charge dead after months of use 
negative,pathetic
positive,it great keyboard with great battery life well built and perfect for the casual gamer it hooked right up to my xbox 
negative,this keyboard is deceptive it really pretty and feels good to use but in about months of use it started having response issues use it for gaming and it would randomly stop responding or lag for few seconds to minutes before recovering it does this regardless of charger status and even when plugged in used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn the bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it think either the keys lose responsivity or the bluetooth signal is losing connection 
neutral,i ve had my mouse for just over month and the scroll tracker stopped working now need to buy new mouse 
positive,i bought this mouse for very light useit work perfect the first week once had to recharge it never turn on againbad quality
positive,it nice and fits nicely the only thing wish was better was how long the usb cable was to power the lights on it
positive,use at work works great
positive,these things are awesome paid don use them for gaming so no rating but the sound quality is so good the only problem is they don adjust any smaller and rest bit heavy on my head they do have cushion though so that helps and my ears are completely covered 
positive,just like the head states the windows key no longer functions also don particularly appreciate that the lights on the keyboard do not stay illuminated for more than few seconds work on three monitors and need functioning windows key to move you guessed it my windows around using the shortcut windows shift arrow key figured it was my pc so changed to different pc in the house had the same issue then went back to my wired keyboard no problems another keyboard for the junk pile 
neutral,sounds quality is trash you can barely hear the game the mic is also terrible everyone is saying sound muffled will never buy from this company again 
negative,this mouse was wonderful when it worked but it stopped after just over month it will not hold charge and is of no use now unfortunately the return window has passed would not suggest purchasing this item 
positive,this mouse is wonderful and easy to use without mouse pad which is big plus bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does stick out the side of my laptop to far it is rechargeable and lasts for while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors totally worth the buy 
positive,i like the size of this speaker and quality of sound it also holds charge so well pleased with the pricing for great product we bluetooth from our phone enjoy streamed music for hours 
neutral,it broke in week

positive,i needed new mouse because the one had been using was so old and was unreliable this new one is so nice for such great price it fits my hand comfortably and has super quiet clicks which is super nice it charges instead of using batteries which is feature that love so excited to keep using this product 
neutral,the scroll button stopped working after months bought it in july and now only november it doesn work anymore it very unfortunate this happened would expect this will last the shape is good it easy to use and to connect but the item received unfortunately didn last will try to contact the seller and see what they say 
positive,just great sound from this speaker pretty durable and water resistant too great purchase 
negative,the only thing that is bad is that you cannot use it on chromebook laptop without gaming tower 
positive,awesome

neutral,i just purchased jbl charger speakers mazon chargers me each they are priced on mazon at each please reconfigure my bill shelley
positive,love it 
positive,overall works ok ear cushions are too small have slightly larger than average ears guess oval shaped holes for ears are width height other than that seems to work fine audio and mic worked without problem 
neutral,cancellation is good for the price sound is good ear holes are little small but the cord constantly wraps up on itself getting kinked and tangled 
positive,great keyboard comfortable wireless transponder is solid haven had any connectivity issues charges quickly can be used while charging as long as the charging cord is plugged into the wall not computer 
positive,i like the portability of thecharge sound quality and the easy connect ability to blue tooth 
negative,do not recommend bought it two months ago and the roller part already broke and it is now useless
positive, yr old son loves it 
positive,cannot go wrong for the price buttons are totally silent and feel solid same with the scroll wheel not gaming most but ve had no problems with accuracy comes with slim usb port and pretty large usb port but it allows for usb passthrough which is neat can speak to battery life yet but it seems to have great power saving features so easily recharge with micro usb note this does not have bluetooth 
positive,so can here it in any room want great buy
positive,i really like this mouse it is low profile and fits my small hands perfectly the only thing really don like about it is all the flashes of different color lights on it need to check to see if there is way to disable the light feature otherwise very nice mouse 
positive,excellent for gaming amd music 
positive,great product for the price my son loves it
neutral,this mouse works really well the only thing is don feel like the battery lasts very long use it for work and those are hour days of non stop computer work only get about days of use before have to recharge again 
positive,this is amazing it comfortable and you can hear clearly
neutral,i bought you can hear anything on either one of them my husband daughter play xbox with each other in separate rooms but neither one could hear the other he replaced his with turtle beach she would try to use both to see if either one would work he could never hear her she couldn hear him we replaced hers with turtle beach also now they just sit 
negative,he really likes the headset but they hurt his ears bit after while of use 
negative,well thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them however not only do they not maintain charge while turned off literally have to charge both after one dies and it not like these things last that long so that pathetic but also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting the mouse still will just flash red and not work got rd to replace the nd but that one was just as bad they are all bad this is waste of money you re better off dealing with batteries than these cheap wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway please don buy because you will be happy with it right until the return window closes 
neutral,i purchased the rose gold and it matches my airbook charges fast and lasts long time between charges glad bought this wireless mouse use it for hrs day days week 
neutral, ve only had the mouse for one month it no longer wants to charge have the matte black mouse and the paint is peeling off 
neutral,good quality sound welbilt

positive,i purchased this mouse because was tired of having to uninstall and re install bluetooth mouse was using this mouse is very responsive fits nicely in my small hand and is an excellent buy for the price the battery lasts and turns itself off after no use for awhile

positive,great quality sound and long lasting battery

neutral,it is easy to use
neutral,i ve had the mouse less than months and both the roller wheel and the piece that plugs into the usb port both broke managed to super glue the roller wheel back together but it just broke again buy slightly better mouse if you can not sure if all the reviews are even real 
positive,beautiful my daughter loves it

neutral,this was really good mouse quiet clicks very lightweight and it moved smoothly over my mouse pad it fell opened up bit was able to put it clip it back in but after the third fall the ball stopped working but for the price it def worth it long battery life think charged like middle of every other week and used it from weekdays for about hours 
positive,purchased this for my son and it has been great to take some noise down and gives him better sound 
neutral,these do not cover the ears well and therefore let in lots of sound from the outside am coming from an old pair of hyperx headphones they were great other than not having an online volume these bengoo units are absolutely horrible head is throbbing within minutes of wearing 
positive,very functional and estetically pleasing very quick wireless connection even via kvm only con is that it doesn sense and light up when your fingers approach kb like the logitech k
neutral,ok
positive,i have charge that use on daily basis and loved it so decided to purchase the latest version charge as birthday gift since it was on sale for the same price as the charge that unfortunately was big mistake read the reviews about the mono speaker issues and they were spot on we played the charge and right next to each other and the charge had much richer and more immersive sound do not spend the extra for the charge save your money and get the charge promise you won regret it

negative,i ve bought jbl charge speakers over the past years and one flip which is sort of still working and the first two after admitted heavy daily use just stopped working as the item is not easily opened by design or repaired don feel there is any option other than buying other one for usd anyone have any luck getting them repaired after they die 
neutral,ok
positive,absolutely love this jbl
positive,the product is good and operates well 
negative,my first concern is that it does not give you warning when it needs recharging it just dies out if you are using your usb for something else you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse second the charge does not last long very frustrating and now the most important it died just stopped working oh well so much for fancy going back to battery operated mouse 
positive,love how quiet the mouse is love that it came with an adapter for usb love the recharging capabilities very nice feel in the hand one thing is wish would have gotten the color that wanted wanted silver but got gray 
neutral,worth it
positive,good for gaming comfortable
positive,i very surprised by this speaker did lot of research ahead of time and decided on this one as it highly regarded ve heard several different bt speakers and none sounded this good extremely satisfied with the bass output it best if used few feet away from you as it sounds better had it outside last night during rainstorm it was basically getting misted on for hours but no ill effects you will not be dissatisfied 
positive,i love the light on the side that what draw my attention to this beautiful mouse and have been looking fir quite mouse for awhile and this is it

positive,decent product and great value for the price sightly recommend 
positive,this is an excellent keyboard and exactly what was looking for the keys are extremely responsive and like the low profile of the keyboard also the keys are extremely quiet and the different color lighting is cool easy function button combinations controls functions such as turning the color lighting off or adjusting the dimness brightness of the lighting the packaging is great and liked the message the company provides in black envelope along with the stickers this product works great with kvm switch highly recommend 
positive,perfect for gaming minecraft youtuber and these were perfect for my channel they fitted nicely for any size and were adjustable the sound cancellation was really good could nt hear any of the background noise while working as soon as put them on noticed difference in the sound it was so much nicer and clearer when had them on best headphones out there 
neutral,is easy to install ergonomic and functional
positive,i got this for my sister for her birthday to go with her new laptop and she absolutely loves it very easy to use and adorable
negative,i got this for my son for christmas last year he used it with his xbox and computer in typical kid fashion he lost the usb dongle contacted their customer service and they sent new one at no charge 
negative,not great item for long term use could be more sturdy 
neutral,scroll is not working properly after months of usage undoubtedly battery is very good though 
positive,at first was little bit worried about the quality of this product but let me tell you this worked out perfectly 
negative,bought two of these and one broke after weeks sadly
neutral,i really was disappointed in this product just needed an extra mouse for work andnit only worked for few hours before the problems started it wouldn track where the mouse was and the lights worked but the mouse was useless other than the light show save your time and choose mouse from more reputable company
positive,could not be happier cord little long but certainly not deal breaker sound quality and comfort a
positive,liked the size and curved screen easy on the eyes 
positive,i can attest to how noise canceling they are or the sound quality my kids took them out of the box hated how short the mic was so returned them otherwise think they would ve worked just fine but we had headphones like these at one point in time supposedly bc the mic is too short it doesn come fully at the mouth others you re gaming with have hard time hearing you this is review from kid gamer who shouts at everyone so sure that if they can hear you bc the mic is too far away then that gospel truth in gaming land 
positive,love this mouse work excellent 
negative,purchased in june busted in september the center wheel broken inside rendering the device worthless 
positive,this is such great mouse it works so well and love the pretty colors it also doesn make any noise while clicking which was my priority would definitely recommend this 
negative,the mouse was decent for the price however now just about weeks out of my return window and the scroll stopped working on the mouse days ago was hoping it was random temporary issue but it seems it permanent disappointed that can at least return or exchange the item and now have to go and buy new mouse 
neutral,for work purposes
positive,update have upped my review from to since reached out to the seller and they offered to send replacement usb dongle will update the review again once that has been received would have given this mouse five stars month ago but yesterday when removed the usb dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless tried to piece it back together but it won stay together it shame because this mouse is really cool looking feels nice in my hand and holds charge long time very disappointed 
positive,the headphones were great they had excellent sound quality the microphone had few issues the audio it pur out was alittle disappointing but with few small adjustments was able to work properly would recommend to any game looking for affordable and good quality headset 
neutral,the speaker is powerful
positive,awesome
positive,i knew what was getting myself into reading the bad reviews it stops working in few weeks usually hedge my bets especially when product has so many reviews that end up with star rating alas lost this bet the scroll function key feature look for in buying mice stopped responding after few weeks fluke should buy scratcher if so because bought two one white one black and they both failed around the same time wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way though as seeing many other reviews doing the same thing but people being bribed for star if replaced quite genius actually if you get angry customers to review it promotes product engagement but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting star review if this indeed is the case bravo brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for subpar product 
neutral,great battery life still feels flimsy and sometimes the keys are delayed 
positive,this speaker is far more that what expected own smaller veraion of it and the battery dies fast this one on the other hand is little bigger but the sound is great and the battery life omg 
neutral,had it five days and it would not recharge threw it away 
neutral,performs as expected
negative,pros wireless ease of use feels nice soft smooth sleek dampened click quietcons it has very loud scroll button the wheel works fine but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud so it slightly defeats the purpose of quiet mouse no additional buttons such as back or forward additional you have to charge the mouse with the included usb charger
positive,my year old son likes these headphones they work great and look nice they are also very comfortable the lights are nice touch we would purchase them again 
positive,great sound quality for it size easy to connect to phone bluetooth battery seems to go on forever 
neutral,it extremely uncomfortable to use maybe if you re on trip and need something to do the job this will work definitely not for daily use gaming or work 
neutral,wszystko okey
positive,my son really enjoyed this headset he liked the look they were comfortable and sound was good but the microphone stopped working within months 
positive,i bought this mouse for my son to do homework at home he was excited to to used it this led wireless mouse have so many color to choice the mouse is light weight rechargeable pad smooth button are easily to click and responsive love it because is good price and you can bring for work and traveling super easy am definitely recommend this mouse 
positive,purchased months ago and nothing to do but throw it away charging port is loose and won connect with cable flimsy and not made to last like nearly everything today the colored lights might be fun but better to pay for quality that doesn need replaced 
positive,this is the best computer mouse have ever bought like that you just recharge it 
positive,i love all the colors this mouse has keep on thru the nite last long time on one charge
positive,great sound
positive,got it as gift for my sis who has ps she adores it
positive,everything is good but the keys would look better with light color light it means on the left side blue purple mixes up with black color of the keyboard makes the contrast less appealing it works great on the right side though with green light blue there is no yellow though that would be better 
neutral,upon receiving these was so excited to see these lit up while use them to game on my xbox the design of them is bisually appealing upon unboxing the pink looked little cheap but sure the other colors with black would have been better was saddened to discover that in order for them to light up you have to plug them into usb which the splitter for this is very inconveniently placed close to the controller and the cord is extremely short so that was big after being bummed about that shrugged it off and started gaming with them anyway got minutes into my game when sound started breaking up another minutes later and they completely stopped working tested my old headset just to be sure and the old worked verifying the headset was junk sending back and paying the extra for turtle beach 
positive,so bought this few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday the color changing lights worked and now only the red light works this is bs turned it off for mins to give it rest but nope the lights still don work don recommend
positive,the scroll wheel on the mouse broke after less than week of using it liked the mouse before that it was easy to setup comfortable to use and the colors look nice really liked the silent mouse click but now that can scroll with the mouse will need to buy new one
neutral,it does not work
neutral,only headset that lasted more than month finally 
positive,the wireless mouse worked well in the begining it was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were nice though not necessary feature received it in september it wasnt something used every day about once or twice week in february the scroll wheel just broke it spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen do not use it often and am definitely not rough on it am dissapointed in the quality of this product 
positive,i bought this mouse because saw it was wireless silent click which was perfect for me working in class room and not loving to hear the click of mouse all day have dropped it times and each time have been able to just move the plastic back into place and repair so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when move between classes to see my different classes 
positive,pros games sound nice and loud without any distortion cheap but good great first time gaming head set comfortable even when playing for four or more hours cons no noise canceling large and somewhat cumbersome cord is long and thick so if you have it plugged into ps or ps controller it is annoyingly in the way usb connector for the led lights is also annoying not even sure what the lights are for anyway you can see them when wearing the headset unless you play in front of mirrior good cheap entry level headset my first one it is comfortable and lightweight but feels reasonably sturdy sound is nice an loud crisp but not lot of bass would definitely recommend for the casual gamer like myself microphone is omnidirectional and pretty sensitive so keep that in mind if you are playing in noisy environment 
positive,i love it
positive,my rd time buying one works for all consoles and pc best mic out there for the price works great
positive,very comfortable and not too heavy as most over the ear headphones can get warm after while good sound quality 
positive,great price functions well comfortable to wear
negative,i threw these away becuase lights dont work mic does not work and the sound does not work only good thing is noise cancelation when you put them on these are terrible 
positive,great sound with bass battery last very long time 
neutral, chinese junk lasted month
neutral,does not recharge never did light up as advertised
positive,make garage work and bbq so much more fun 
positive,love how loud it gets 
positive,was very good for both gaming and juts overall audio it not completely soundproof but still an outstanding headset 
neutral,good sound fast charging
positive,i love my new keyboard love that the keys are not flat the best part is they light up it makes typing so much easier those that complain about the space bar being loud it isn if you hit it in the middle have had no issues and my typing is way better than the flat one was using it is very comfortable to type and doesn take up lot of space perfect 
positive,needed wireless mouse for work laptop and this mouse gets the job done the price is very affordable and the product came very fast was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the clicking sound that should come in handy during the early mornings work days would recommend this mouse if anyone is trying to find something for their macbook usb port 
positive,great
positive,great sound small and compact but very clear and loud great product 
neutral,very good
positive,love the sleek style and easy to glide use of the mouse love the colors as well
negative,i use this for my second computer and it broke tonight maybe used it total of times and all of sudden it broke of course it out of the return window don waste your money 
negative,don bother even thinking about purchasing this item it terrible does not connect to anything very cheap looking the color doesn match the description the seller is little suspicious too tried giving me refund with fake amazon gift card 
positive,this was the perfect gift for my son he loves it the blue lights are plus 
neutral,on my laptop it skips doesn read about of the time making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces and it does the same no matter what 
neutral,small lightweight yet firm solid feel led lighting is nice touch shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown however the main reason purchased was because of the silent feature sadly it not as silent as had hoped clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing why cant someone make truly silent mouse have yet to find one as most silent mice are merely muffled by rubber lining shame would be perfect otherwise
positive,works good mic stopped working but the seller was very quick in sending replacement copy good
neutral,would not work with any controller have only worked with my phone have different types of xbox one controllers and it didn work with any of them cheaply made poor quality 
positive,i love this mouse use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven used it in while however it is easy to wake up as well like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors its quite and moves smoothly did mention love it 
neutral,like
positive,i just purchased this mouse to use with my new laptop and am impressed with the quietness of the buttons and it has helped me win on my games
neutral,really liked how light weight the product is however it stopped working after months the battery life was great in the beginning but now it doesn operate even after charging it 
positive,i was kind of skeptical for only but definitely worth the price they are comfortable decent noise canceling and they look good too stars
neutral,i like it has case to pack it up and go 
positive,i bought this as gift for my son and he loves it 
positive,the headphones were nice do appreciate the the fact it has mic attached and they are pretty comfy on my head and its fits tightly on my head so don have to worry about it falling off or anything so it good for gaming when you need to focus its one of those headphones that has two cords for phone and pc plugins which is slightly annoying since don have pc but since it does have one its good for those that have and play pc games
positive,the good looks nice and feels good in your hand the bad the right click button is too sensitive constantly opening up the right click menu the pointer freezes and have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it the ugly ordered silver mouse and got dark gray 
neutral,wish it came with more detailed user manual it can do things not mentioned in the booklet
positive,fits my hand perfectly 
neutral,i liked this mouse when it worked but the scroll real broke within couple weeks 
neutral,they are not loud at all even turned up all the way on the headset and you can barely hear it
neutral,junk lasted few months
positive,good quality for good price 
neutral,product didn work straight out of the box unfortunately we didn get to use the product within the return window so out the cost of the product never could get it to connect even though we followed the troubleshooting guide downloaded from the manufacturer light came on when you typed but nothing every showed on the screen not impressed though with the hour charge use stated on the box for that you might as well get wireless unit with batteries 
positive,sounds really good like it lot 
positive,this headset was purchased as christmas present for my son he really loves it his friends ask him what headset he has because they can hear him perfectly must have good sound quality because he can never hear me when try to talk to him great product for the price glad we went with this one 
positive,i love this mouse but hate it at the same time love it because it cute and it functions well that is if it doesn run out of battery charge during normal use the charge only lasts for about days it good that it can be recharged just didn think would be recharging it that often you can tell when it running low because it starts jumping all over the place just try to remember to charge it while charging my laptop also was under the impression that it came as usbc to charge and it does not it comes with an adapter for usb to usbc could ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear 
negative,i bought this about months ago and use it only for work and the scroll wheel broke and the mouse is now glitching very disappointed in this purchase quality 
positive,works great
positive,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review 
positive,i used this in my first gaming pc setup and for the price it is very high quality it is comfortable to wear and the sound quality is pretty good the microphone quality is also pretty good for cheap gaming headset would recommend 
positive,it cute looking comfortable except short uncomfortable charging cord just use battery it was great and then broke after weeks just stopped 
negative,my family bought of these for our twins in less than month one of the mics broke the other set had one of the ear speakers break after only week so disappointed 
neutral,didnt last long
neutral,after having the jbl flip for several years and loving it decided to upgrade and purchase the jbl charge bought it new and once it came in tested it out however the sound quality was extremely distorted and sounded like the speaker was already blown because the bass was so scratchy even at volume am not sure if this is an issue with the jbl charge or the individual speaker received either way will be returning this product and am very disappointed 
positive,whereas on the charge the bass gets bit overwhelming on the charge the bass feels non existant by comparison further sound on the charge is less clear than on the charge details in your music get off faint notes disappear although the bass on the charge could be overwhelming the overall sound quality was much better further the charge is heavier bulkier than the charge despite less functionality on the charge could make phone calls but there is no calling ability on the charge if the charge upgraded its bluetooth to be better compatible with more modern devices would trash the charge and go back to the charge the only improvement on the charge over the charge is that the power button is bit easier to press 
neutral,this mouse works for mins or less at time then has to be powered off and on it starts lagging charged it all night so its not battery issue and it only works when its all lit up not in the mode
positive,my son says they are great 
positive, pretty and sleek just opened it says to charge for hours with usb cable in box umm what cable luckily have plenty of chargers so once use it shall update review update works as it should love the color changing no complaint 
neutral,bought this speaker for my dad who is an expert in car audio and he was impressed in the quality and volume this speaker has 
neutral,i ve had two jbl speakers over the last years and use the frequently treat them well don drop them get them soaked or anything like that all that being said the battery either dies or it will no longer get loud moving on to another brand 
positive,my son loves it still has it
positive, feels great wide and comfortable lights up when you move around likes so much bought second one too 
positive,good gaming mouse use it to play game 
positive,great headphones great sounds quality 
neutral,this is not compatible with hp or google chrome devices 
positive,very nice use it for day to day duties not for gaming works very well 
positive,great for the price everything works well and as expected
neutral,you have to press down very hard on the mouse it gets very annoying wish still had the box return it
neutral,ow
neutral,it would ve been nice if this actually worked 
positive,great sound
positive,jbl speakers are the best bought this speaker as gift and own one too 
positive,looks nice love water resistance not loud at all
neutral,i bought of these one stopped working months in and the other stopped months in of course it too late to get replacements 
positive,the headset works great for my ps ipad pro and pcs sound quality is awesome and outside distraction noises are limited
positive,got for my husband he loves it
negative, there are few good things about this keyboard lights number keys wireless rechargeable but the space bar is major deal breaker for me was looking for quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing the space bar is annoyingly loud even when typing without having to be quiet on conference call it is very annoying my partner down the hall can here me typing good features on this keyboard but really cannot stand the space bar it an instant return for me the worst part is they market this as quiet keyboard it far from quiet 
negative,the mouse worked great loved it actually but the charging cord is severed and while it does charge it also will shock you little if you accidentally touch it while plugging into charging port or plugging the mouse in and because the charging cord is only inches hard to refrain from touching where it is severed will stop using this when new different mouse arrives 
positive,exactly what was looking for sleek and quiet and also pretty with the lights you can turn the rainbow lights off if you don want them on 
positive,beautiful keyboard
neutral,my bf loves his new headphone the cord is kind of long but he hasn complained 
neutral,i like everything about it
neutral,i do like the mouse but the usb connector does not go all the way in to my macbook which is frustrating 
neutral,the quality is worth the product 
neutral,trash volume is too low 
positive,great product will be purchasing this again
positive,it is great
neutral,smashing sparking clear undistorted sound from hertz all the way to hertz and loud without distortion 
neutral,doesn hold charge lasted however long the battery was charged for initially and that was it 
neutral,it felt like cheap product upon arrival and usage after months and no longer charges and is absolutely useless 
neutral,great gaming keyboard not as bright as thought it would be 
positive,great product delivered with exceptional expectations thank you my kid love this keyboard
positive,so the blue light won work unless you plug into additional usb power device kind of lame mean year old kid was sad as it showed them blue but guess my fault not reading more should just be battery would last forever being ledanyways it tried them on and they do block some noise the sound is pretty good he loves them would recommend as they are cheap and haven tried anything else 
neutral,don get the white one it gets dirty fast 
positive,everything of this speaker is amazing and you ll love it recommend getting it no matter what people say and what youtube videos say if you can afford it get it
negative,unfortunately this mouse stopped working after month of use can replace the item or get refund 
positive,it worked great it would get little slow when it needed charging but all of sudden it won come on even after charging 
neutral,didn work after days
negative,upon unpackaging the item everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow however after coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding charge the light would turn on indicating that it was charging and couple of minutes later the light was off told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so left it on to charge for couple of hours unfortunately the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this ergonomic design and lighting is great but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose star 
neutral, the headphones don fit adult ears the headphones aren very loud at all turned them all the way up just to actually hear footsteps in my game the lights don work unless your in pc don care too much about that the mic sounds terrible my friends clowned me for having such god awful mic this would be the last gaming headset would buy don waste your money on this 
positive,this keyboard looks great and works well great customer service got this keyboard when the pandemic first hit it worked great for few months and then one of the keys started to misbehave not having time to deal with it put it to the side and forgot about it after picking it back up and trying again more of the keys had stopped working about years later reached out to customer service siting the year warranty and they were absolutely wonderful both helpful and very nice and replaced the product now have the new keyboard and have been using it and have not had any troubles 
positive,love it good price and product 
neutral,not enough adjustability through speaker ie more less bass or highs
positive,nery nice incredible for the price fits snugg to the head and ears very nice sound and good mic very surprised for the price of blue bought 
positive,nice color and strong base 
neutral,i like the feel of this keyboard the back lighting works well it solid keyboard the only reason didn give it stars is the back slash key is next to the enter key all my other keyboard have it above the enter key frequently hit the backslash when intending to press enter ll get use to it and would probably them give this stars after do 
neutral,roller broken only used maybe times
negative,after exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse the lights are kind of distracting not necessary however it does stay charged for week or more at time cheap and bought this for data work it works other than the middle wheel now and is okay for the price or if you don have high expectations 
positive,the speaker is amazing the sound from this little speaker is awesome 
positive,i love how noise cancelling they are it came with free audio jack which was delighful surprise my friends say they can hear me lot clearer now overall very pleased
positive,slim and fits comfortably in palm of hand wish that would have purchased sooner 
neutral,i actually really love this mouse its slim and quiet the multicolored led lights stopped working after days but it does not affect the quality of it just bummer they dont work anymore 
positive,great sounding speaker 
positive,always have been fan of jbl and this little guy doesn disappoint we have of them and they produce excellent sound by the pool 
positive,don know why they just stopped working after month can still hear and but no voice and they aren really that comfortable nor are they that bright 
positive,jbl speakers are the best in terms of quality money it my rd speaker and they are great 
positive,i ordered this mouse really liked it it was slim fit nicely in my hand and loved how the lights changed colors after few months there was problem with it when the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked great customer service would order it again after dealing with them if hadn already bought another mouse because had work to finish give them stars
positive,the scrolling wheel is not working properly after months so have to buy new mouse the usb charging feature is nice though and it is easy to carry 
positive,like design not function frustrating
positive,literally won charge or turn on look somewhere else for mouse 
positive,my teenage son loves it 
neutral,this product was great when got it it was rgb however was expecting to be able to change colors this part doesn matter as much as the rest received the item jan th worked up until the morning of used it every day not sure what is going on with it as can flip the power from off to on and the red light flickers but doesn come on 
positive,best earphones ve purchased so far
neutral,i purchased this mouse for home office don have glass table but guess surface is too smooth for it to work silent operation very comfortable battery lasts decent time lasted for week straight without turning it off not returning it but not super happy with the issue 
positive,bought it for my nephew birthday and he loved it so much great buy 
neutral,only issue was the ear hole are touch small but if you adjust enough they will cover them 
positive,really good sound quality comfortable for hours because the ear pieces fit over the entire ear instead of squishing it down 
neutral,have to bang mouse to get it to wake up 
positive,it cool mouse but don think it worth the price whenever use it my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use it not my computer fault because switched mouses and the other one works fine also the color changing lights are see through from the top got white one and it kind of ruins the feel it just feels really cheap honestly though if it was maybe cheaper and it didn glitch the curser say it worth it like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries and like how it comes with lightning usb adapter 
neutral,it needs charge ever other day even if it is not used what junkwhen it needs charge sometimes it will charge and other times it does not so now own this klim wireless keyboard that requires the usb cable to be attached to work
neutral,right button defective after month usage 
neutral,tup
positive,it wireless but not bluetooth very misleading as it was recommended with the other mice that was total waste of money but fits nicely in your palm with small hands

neutral,mouse goes dormant after seconds and is extremely glitchy until you turn it off and back on and then it works ok until you stop using it again zero out of five would never buy again
negative,update made my review to fast keyboard has stopped working completely charged fully but does not work type when connected to computer even had my boyfriend who works in it try to figure out if it was my pc and it for sure is not it the keyboard smooth typing great to use for work but be careful it would of stopped me from buying it if knew it did this make sure you turn it off every night it will be dead the next day when you go to use it that was the bad part forgot to turn it off after work one night and the next morning it died on me when was typing with customer on the phone and had to fumble to find the power cord 
positive,wow this mouse is pretty choose the gold colored one and like it connecting to my laptop was simple just plug and play plus the slim design fits great in my laptop bag 
positive,excellent sound great bass and treble but it doesn seem possible to change any equalizer settings every time the speaker is turned on off it makes rather loud noise it pleasant just kind of loud 
neutral,my grandson loved it the first week then the lights stop working mow the sound one week 
neutral,the mouse works fine it is slim kind of cheap plastic but the lights which in photos look like it would just be thin line around the mouse are very annoying the entire thing lights up you can not turn them off and still use the mouse it is very distracting did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong but will donate it to charity or someone ordered another one with no lights

neutral,i bought this for my husband for his birthday gift week before his birthday then gave it to him on his birthday and weeks later it starts acting up and showing fully charged and only playing for an hour or before dying this item states that it plays for hours when fully charged which is false call amazon and since it was few days out of the day period for return had to go to jbl for manufacturer warranty they send you label and said it would take days to determine if it is really defective for them to send replacement am not at all happy with this product totally not worth the money have had my bose soundlink for years and still sounds great and plays for long time will not recommend this product

negative,i expected the earmuffs to actually fit over my ears but these are too small and just sit on top of my ear pressing then down which with long gaming sessions causes fair amount of pain an discomfort edit today may the seller bengoo contacted me directly and offered me as an incentive to remove my negative review which is violation of amazons sellers policies 
positive,bought on prime day for great price it was easy to sync to my laptop comfortable grip have been using for couple of days the charge lasted longer than expected functions wonderfully did not use it for gaming so can not accurately rate that

positive,i originally ordered the white version but when got it realized it was see through asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version ordered or what all the white mouses look like they re all white according to the shop because raised concern they were so kind to ship different color to me free of charge didn even have to return the original 
positive,i bought one to try for myself at home and loved it so much ordered two more to use at work this is the best wireless mouse ve ever had great value too

negative,it quit working after less than months ugh it no wonder they only have day return policy 
neutral,charging is little bit of pain it changes really slow love it though and for some reason have to keep connecting to it and thought it would just remember my device 
positive,i purchased this as gift for my boyfriend yes they look very nice but they slip of your head continuously the microphone quality is absolute trash who ever you try talking to they will not be able to hear you you can barely hear with these set to the highest volume it allows and it so quiet did end up returning it and buying sony brand headset those were 
positive,you know it good when you cannot hear single soul around you noise cancelling is very good comfort is top notch and works great we will definitely purchase again if needed

neutral,i waited while to leave review tought it would last but it didn it was really smooth and long lasting battery little did know while using it it would become apart internally the scrollwheel broke usually fix my electronics easily sometimes things just need little adjustment but this part broke and with no fixing maybe some of you are lucky and doesn break easily mine did and not even weeks of using it 
positive,i was happy with this purchase until the mouse wheel quit working purchased this device on july and week ago september it quit working after looking through the questions see others have experienced this too wouldn purchase this item it known issue

positive,works fantastically would just like it to be bit louder but overall great product 
positive,i ve taken this thing on the go for few months now and it great speaker purchased it to replace my stolen charge the quality is very good for most genres and the bass is something to appreciate the battery life is outstanding sometimes forget to turn it off disabled the power sounds for it and it easier to forget now and it will last days of just being on it very portable as long as you have decent sized bag to carry it in used my backpack very good purchase 
negative,its only been couple of months since started using this keyboard but am not able to use it when it is plugged in for charging anymore this is really annoying as have to switch to different keyboard when this one dies not very reliable product 
neutral,the little wheel broke within the nd day
positive,this is low rise mouse very responsive and smooth movement would definitely buy one again note don play games so can speak to that aspect 
positive,best purchase ever ve never heard of rechargeable mouse love the light color changing feature which is bonus this is must buy 
positive,the best stuff ever the sound is lush and clear 
neutral,i was not fond of this mouse the ergonomics too flat or charge life now after months of average to minimum use it will not charge my system gives an error message of malfunctioning device tried different usb cord with the same response donot recommend this mouse 
neutral,its nice mouse good size but the scrolling wheel doesn roll anymore ve only had it for month and it broke 
positive,this small speaker has just as good quality sound as my professional speaker purchased for hundreds of dollars easy to use and bluetooth connect is rapid 
positive,i really like this mouse super easy to connect and the charge lasts forever swear charge it once every weeks and leave it on by accident all the time but the sleep mode is great recommend 
positive,love everything about this speaker
neutral,i bought this mouse for work and it worked great the first month however after month it started working slower and slower and just stopped working not good use of money 
positive,i like the product but why did get another charge of dollars and one cent the next day please explain
positive,the sound quality is awesome so clear no matter how high the volume is 
positive,update we were sent new pair free of charge it been days and they still work socthats good will update after couple weeks worked for week and then the plug quit working you have to twist it back and forth to hear anything would not buy again 
neutral,like
negative,i was really looking forward to having wireless mouse that rechargeable but since it has to be recharged every day just use it with the wire attached very disappointing 
positive,really great sound quality fits nicely on my head and the mic works good great noise cancelation great for playing fps games
positive,this mouse is on point literally had never thought of buying one to this slant and size until the color locked me in it an absolute match to my laptop the setup was quick and easy simply turned it on input the usb and was using within seconds it very versatile and works with or without pad lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape 
neutral,i bought this for backup wireless mouse it only lasts about hours per charge not good when you work remotely for hours day 
neutral,don walk run from this keyboard and company they say there is year warranty but there is not keyboard will stop working less than months from purchase
positive,this mouse is good for its price its light and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice when you press down it more of subtle soft click which like lot rather than an annoying and loud click however it does feel little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low when using the led mode you can practically see inside the mouse once again though for it not bad like it because can connect it to my macbook air too which uses an usb 
positive,all is great could be little bigger
positive,comfortable and responsive mouse clicking is indeed very quiet lights are just as advertised and battery is more than satisfactory can use multiple days without charging 
positive,absolute garbage day of using if you have it on the multicolor setting the mouse will not work should have known something was up when the instructions were only in mandarin it went straight to the trash can after couldn get it to work it also feels super cheap please if you re reading these reviews we re not lying do not buy this mouse 
positive,so far love it
positive,overall the set is fine nothing ridiculous you get what you pay for pretty much just needed fair priced pair to replace my blown out ones perhaps my biggest gripe about this product is that the volume knob is total joke there is very little range on the adjustment to the volume compared to how much the knob is able to turn on the way to turning it up the majority of the time you re turning the knob your volume is not adjusting the range feels like it begins and ends within less than third of the knob ability to turn in the volume increase direction 
positive,mine worked at first but now it just lights up when attempt to type doesn register the keys and doesn work for gaming like had hoped ordered little over month ago and it barely works really sad about my purchase and would recommend buying higher quality keyboard 
positive,my son loves this headset he says its made his gaming life much better 
positive,i am using this headset for gaming when got them took alittle bit to figure out that you have to have the boom mic all the way down to use it when it is up it is muted other than that am really enjoying them and worth the money 
positive,sounds good looks cool great starter set for any new streamer 
positive,this mouse has the quietest click of any mouse ve ever owned and it puts itself to sleep if don move it for while it magical wasn sure about the color changing light but it not overpowering or distracting ve had very long line of previous wireless mice but think this is my favorite very pleased with this purchase 
neutral,this mouse is just trash it lifespan is days stopped working just days after the return window closed don recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting getting tired of amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse 
positive,i have owned this speaker for year now and still love it pros great volume and sound some of the best bass have experienced from bluetooth portable speaker very durable forgot the speaker on the top of my car at one point and this device finally fell off at around mph onto blacktop and bounced down the road thought had just completely ruined my jbl but other than some superficial scuffing nothing was damaged have used the speaker to play music in the rain and there were no issues the battery typically lasts over hours with easecons the volume tends to be to loud the volume makes big jumps when clicked so occasionally just can hit that sweet spot it also doesn go low enough for quiet study music at least for me 
neutral,mouse stopped working after months 
neutral,best headset ve bought so far my first real headset my last one ve had for years and was the only one had since got my ps so was nervous to get another one this one is even better only sad part is can get it to light up
positive,works great only have to charge it once every weeks and use it daily at the office 
positive,i needed wireless mouse for my new laptop and found this to be reasonable price it is great design usb dongle can mount under the mouse itself for travel so you don lose it as it is very compact which is really nice for laptop has two modes one is on and the other mode is on with color it nice to have the option as to be able to save battery life the mouse clicks are silent which was different experience for me but it nice it does go into standby mode if not used to save battery and takes couple seconds to wake up but to me this is better than killing the battery all in all this was good purchase 
neutral,i not going to lie this is probably the most awesome portable speaker have ever had in my life the battery lasts like hours and at links with other speakers which is awesome my only problem is don li had it months and it already stopped taking charge this is my nd jbl speaker to do that so don know if it just product problem or what but if it wasn for that would have given this out of stars 
neutral,amazing feels cheap but is very durable
positive,just bought near end of july already having issues battery drains extremely fast pointer has tracking issues won click most of the time have to repeatedly click on something for it to work 
neutral,thankyou

positive,have been eyeball this one for years love the pink color looks exactly as it does in the picture 
neutral,sturdy construction reasonable volume too much bass level 
positive,i love it
positive,it could me louder but it works and sounds great volume is not that big of deal
positive,i got sick of using my touchpad and needed an actual mouse for printing software trying to rotate and re size print patterns with touchpad was nightmare but this is great mouse for the price and has already made my life lot easier

neutral,this is an update to my last review it has been months and it stopped working bought this because of the price and color next time will go with more reputable company 
positive,love it
neutral,i was not able to use product missing usb 
positive,great product already own wired version of this exact keyboard was so happy with it bought the wireless version both keyboards are in use today and wonderful don hesitate this is the keyboard for you 
neutral,i was bit too busy with work and school and missed my window to return this item the quality of the mouse and usb plug is just horrible ordered the mouse with urgency to get power point project done for schooland had to run to local discount store to purchase another mouse because the usb piece fell apart and after careful putting it back together the mouse won connect over got about minutes of use fromthis product 
positive,update after year of not so actively using it does not make any sound we did not use it much had to charge battery once or twice in total the last time battery died and after charging it it does not make any sound at all think it was second time had to charge other functions like bluetooth light and buttons are working though tried to upgrade software by downloading and connecting mobile app but no result whatsoever am really disappointed about that do not even know what to do keep it or get rid of it easy to use descent sound quality and battery performance usability bluetooth connection easily discoverable easily usable even for non tech at all peoplesound quality bass and high notes sound clear with very pleasant deep bass battery performance do not know if that is standard but my one was decently charged right from the box and played for several hours non stop without any additional charge battery charges fast and lasts as promised will need special cover holder for it to carry and keep safe comfortablywould highly recommend 
neutral,light weight no lag great value
neutral,everything about it
negative,stopped working day and half after got it ve charged it and everything and it just won work good for the couple of hours that did use it thought the lights were pretty so give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was waste of my money since it no longer works 
positive,noise cancellation is okay its not bad but its not amazing but overall the sound quality is really good and the headphones feel very high quality its really good for the price 
positive,super cool
neutral,used like times before it died don understand the reviews horrible product save your money
neutral,like the sound and delivery of music 
neutral,this mouse is ergonomic light weight and very easy to use unfortunately the color shown in the picture for rose gold was not very accurate it is much darker would still buy it again though 
neutral,very fine bluetooth speaker once again jbl builds quality product 
positive,noise cancellation is awesome 
positive,the best ergonomic and lightweight feels comfortable after hours of use at my laptop fits perfectly in the pocket of laptop bag not bulky like others ve tried stays charged for long time love the color 
positive,i really like this this is replacement for broken battery operated one used to have love that this can charge from usb port and not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time it got cool lights around the side and it works well on lot of surfaces use my laptop in recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine ve also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results it does take just second when the laptop boots up to locate but that minimal the usb wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all all in all ve been very happy with the quality and efficiency this was great purchase 
neutral,it was nice until it stopped working the return window literally closed yesterday
neutral,quiet click holds charge forever colors are nice touch
positive,beautiful and ergonomic the only thing would say is the battery doesn last longer but in general it great product
negative,first purchase received the wrong color they switched it out no problem second mouse came and it stopped working within two three weeks because of the shipping coming from overseas the whole process just made the product less appealing disappointed it stopped working so soon 
positive,the sound quality is amazing 
neutral,i have only used it for few months and it already broke when dropped it on the floor it too fragile 
neutral,because the keylighting was not distinctive enough and because the time out was too fast for our preference it did not meet our needs 
neutral,stopped working already 
neutral,i like the look and feel of this mouse however the fact that you have to charge it is kind of pain it doesn make it through full work day so usually by the end of thebday have to plug in my wired mouse 
neutral,it comfy has decent volume and controls but doesn last full year 
positive,this mouse did not work from the get go which is why am certain was not it first owner this mouse was missing the one part it needed to operate usb receiver which is customarily located securely under the unit itself the mouse was halfway in sleeve as if re stuffed back into it original packaging returning this immediately
neutral,you can use it for consle and still be able to have it light up as the cord where it splits to plug into both isn long enough of split might be good for pc but not for console
negative,so disappointed this promised to be cute and functional mouse but it never worked not even for day charged it followed all directions am tech proficient and it wouldn even turn on feels cheap too so not surprised so disappointing to purchase things that don work all too common anymore 
neutral, 
positive, very light trendy easy to connect and use really love it
negative,i used this headset with my xbox one got it for on black friday deal which was nice though guess got what paid for was lured in little by the led lights and was bit disappointed to find out wouldn be able to use them since they only activate when connected to pc the sound quality was as expected for headset wasn amazing but was by no means terrible the ear cuffs are definitely noise blocking and they re surprisingly comfortable to wear even if you wear glasses since wear glasses most headsets start to hurt my ears after while but experienced no pain with this one the mic was okay never really had any problems with it did have slight problems with the volume control though sometimes it would catch rub on my clothing and randomly turn the volume up or down wasn that big of an issue though since it rarely happened say my only valid complaint was the letdown of only having it for months before it died was really excited about this headset the whole reason bought it was so could get something that would last me bit longer than cheap headset would but it barely lasted me four months what even worse is that still currently have headset that has lasted longer and someone who takes care of all things electronic and electronic related so this was the result of the actual headset failing might have given it or stars had it been of use for just little while longer 
positive,i love the lights and the easy set up 
neutral,a flimsy mouse that broke down within two months of very light use would recommend spending bit more money and buy branded mouse and have peace of mind 
neutral,works well
positive,great sound in small and portable unit ez to operate use it more than either of my bose wave units or my techniques and harman kardon receiver 
positive,really good sound very comfortable and there just nice
positive,very beautiful and easy to use but came apart after few months of using
positive,this headset has immaculate quality the array of colors is really good the options on the dial of the headset is what sold me for sure 
neutral,its okay takes bit to get use too but it was only being used few hours for day it just stopped working see it has usb ports but no cord waste of money
negative,this mouse was certifiable piece of crap worked until the initial charge was drained and never again do not buy this hunk of junk 
neutral,i wanted light up key board so could work in the dark this fit the bill came in two days after order it 
positive,the sound quality on the headset is great it comfortable and good at noise isolation works great for in game chat too 
positive,i ve had it for four months and the battery doesn work and won take charge outside the return window of days
negative,i want to really like this speaker but overall it good quality sound not very loud good bass looks good my biggest complaint is the battery can run this speaker for more than minutes unplugged from the wall before the sound is getting chopped as if it about to die really disappointed considering this speaker wasn cheap 
neutral,quality for the price paid
positive,great headset
positive,bought this for my husband for christmas and he always has it with him in the car that doesn have bluetooth in the garage at the pool this is probably the best gift have ever given the sound is very good and the battery life lasts good long time 
negative,it was sleek and nice looking mouse but the usb got annoying and broke easily
positive,the mouse is slim and lightweight love the way that the inbuilt led light in the mouse changes its colors it is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop the day bought the mouse have been using it without charging the battery for days after surfing the mouse on amazon thought found the right mouse for my computer 
positive,grandson loves it he has no complaints and uses it with his xbox 
positive,the kids use this all the time bought the for me last summer but they use it far more got second one this year so there is always an extra around they take it from pool to porch to room to park and repeat plenty loud for those around it or around pool clear sound at volume and provides full sound even with higher bass music lot of bang for the form factor practical use is mulitdays week on charge so doesn always need charging and doesn strand you would buy again 
neutral,maybe got dud but the battery life is terrible lasts maybe minutes if am lucky seller wouldn return or replace but amazon did got new one and it works right 
neutral,i purchased this in july and it worked perfectly it now ass backwards you have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor if let go of the button it does nothing its completely off track the led only works when it charging before it worked whenever it was on the last switch on the bottom of the mouse 
positive,bought it for father day he loves it
neutral,sadly it is not working 
positive,this is an amazing sounding speaker it has good base but not overpowering the sound is clear and deep it is mono speaker but can be paired with second one for stereo use it at work and am rarely able to go past half way at full volume with an iphone not sure if it matters it never distorts or sounds scratchy 
neutral,i not the only person it seems it works for some and not others don know works fine with other computers ve plugged it into just don buy it for macbook 
neutral,purchased two works as described you can beat this price highly recommend 
neutral,i use it with my chromebook
neutral,it took less than day for the receiver to fall apart in my usb port now the shell is stuck and have to take my computer to get it pulled out 
negative,it work good but not great
neutral,i ve been through two of these mice the first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working opted for an exchange but the new one had the same issue after about weeks looking through reviews it seems to be common issue returning this for another brand 
neutral,product was great just the delivery was horrible this is the first time ve ever had issues they crammed it so tight in my mailbox like to have never gotten it out and could ve damaged my product just by trying to get it outta the mailbox 
neutral,i bought one it didn work out of the box exchanged it for another and it lasted for months before breaking again spend dollar or two more and another brand this one might be the right look but it will only waist your money 
neutral,roller ball broke after weeks of use 
neutral,good
positive,very cheap quality and the sound is ehh worked really well the first day then all of sudden was static and couldn hear the sound clearly 
negative,i bought different one of these in the fall and it worked for short time thought was buying from different company this time but this mouse also has failed me do not buy this mouse charged it and still nothing 
neutral,waste of your money
positive,happy with product good price only down side it that am on my rd pair in years
neutral,hi love it but bought it because it changed colors and it only stays on red

neutral,it worked for about weeks plus afew days before it stopped working 
neutral,fftttt
positive,lightweight mouse easy to charge can use while charging and like the teal color got with fun colors lighting up makes my office work and time at the computer feel little less boring easy to connect and works well with imac 
positive,love these got them on lightening deal don use them for gaming use them for my laptop zooms and love em don hurt my ears and great quality sound on both ends
positive,got it for great price has pretty good noise cancellation and is perfect for me looks better in person than in the pictures love it 
positive,i like this mouse because of the leds and the color but the usb converter that it comes with is not reliable had to use different one in order for the mouse to be usable have also noticed sometimes lag in clicks so wouldn suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise
neutral,scroll wheel broke within few weeks of use 
positive,it was most important to me to have quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop this mouse has quiet silent scrolling and silent clicking very impressed the mouse is more of flat design the lights around it are pretty neat there is an on off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well nice mouse for great price 
neutral,terrible product only reason still have it is because amazon told me just to keep it when requested return and refund battery doesn last at all feels terrible in your hand and the buttons and scroll ball are not accurate stay away there are plenty of other cheap rgb mice 
neutral,does all the things mouse should the sleep mode is nice touch 
negative,not cheap speaker and used it for less then months and it just stops battery is full and it was waste of maney
neutral,the mouse worked fine for maybe or hours with my pc laptop tried it on another laptop and desktop with same result the cursor moves intermittently and is not useable fully charged the mouse and tried with and without usb adaptor and no change 
negative,of course weeks after return window closes the mouse stops working slow movement and doesn respond to commands waste of plastic update seller offered to make this right awaiting final resolution
positive,this was for my son for school work and he loved the features and the fact that it has lights to make it fancy it seems pretty smooth without making clicking noise and compact pretty good alternative for expensive mouses from branded ones
neutral,works well
positive,i love it
neutral,i liked it because it works and that all needed
positive,i love it 
positive,so it possible this is good device however the keyboard receiver combo received is triple malfunctioning it lags excessively between input and recognition tried all usb ports to confirm the sleep mode activates within seconds of disuse so even input tests are wonky and receiving range is maybe ft at best 
positive,wow you really can go wrong with this mouse bought it for work since they still have the wired mouse but the traction is horrible with this replacement no wires no cables only to charge it the traction is great very responsive 
positive,as expected sounds great 
neutral,this is complete upgrade from the flip and the battery life is so much longer
neutral,return back in days the st day it doesn work how did you make it 
neutral,does what it says affordable and cool looking 
negative,when first received the mouse it worked well and enjoyed the multi colors however after month it constantly needed to be charged by three months it no longer cycled the different colors but was only red now at the month mark it no longer tracks move the mouse but my cursor doesn move on the screen ve never had mouse go bad this quickly will not be purchasing this mouse again 
positive,randomly moves the cursor to the top left definitely for gaming 
positive,nice product recommend it for gamers 
neutral,exactly what thought it was gonna be use this at work and although the sleep mode can be annoying it does it job 
positive,great for gaming my son loves them
neutral,i have been using this mouse for weeks now and have no complaints it goes to sleep on its own and comes back on easily with click no delays or problems connecting to bluetooth do wish had way to know what the battery life was but just hook it up every days and it hasn died on me yet 
positive,works great nice and smooth feel
positive,comfortable and great sound
positive, in all honesty there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for mouse but you know what in this time of the pandemic we can all use bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy especially visually this little mouse got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time always brings smile btw it is quiet no noisy clicks the color is beautiful and classic and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers if you re still on the fence get one or more if you want to give yourself little and very useful treat 
positive,my mouse no matter how charged it is loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen it been like this since first plugged it in besides that it pretty and like how the lights combined it also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues 
neutral,great little mouse precisely what was looking for except that it only lasted months ve had it just that long and the scroll wheel is now disconnected and doesn work anymore the mouse is still functional otherwise but use the scroll wheel constantly for work so will just keep it as backup and find something else 
positive,just as the title says works great solid battery life all functions work as described another winner from klim 
positive,okay here we go was really excited to get this and try it out want to note that wasn expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive however my excitement didn last long the dpi will not change on the one got so changed my mouse settings on my pc this very very minimally helped couldn help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic ccccck for some this may fit comfortably in their hand but not mine also it goes to sleep quickly as in seconds quick yes timed it unfortunately ll have to try to return this since won use it ever by try to return it mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office or wherever need to take it because that never actually happens in closing if you have small hands you re looking for super slick meaning super fast mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi you ll only use it once maybe twice year and you re good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned then go for it otherwise maybe look into different one also gave stars since is was inexpensive 
positive,feels and sounds better then expected like the mic switch for faster responses would buy again 
negative,i had the jbl flip then bought this ironically the sound is much better on the flip than the charge it isn bad but not the best for jbl 
neutral,i have this keyboard for desk setup with my laptop which is up on the desk shelf and the keyboard is in the slider under the desk and it won register anything type from that far litterally has no range looks nice like how it feels but won work kinda pissed don have the packaging to send it back either 
positive,our son wanted it for christmas so this is part of what he got he loves it 
positive,it is just ok product for me it could be more finished product but its not sometime it seems like its not clicking at all lights are good but for performance give it three stars 
positive,i buy it again it looks nice and feels nice 
positive,this is great mouse easy to use runs very smoothly and the color matched my keyboard perfectly would recommend this product to anybody 
negative,not the best fit
neutral,leave it for few minutes and come back it has to be turned off and back on needs frequent recharging 
positive,picked these up for my son for his birthday he loves them they work great 
neutral,no computer mouse was amazing
neutral,this mouse worked ok for couple of months then it just won work anymore tried charging it and it just doesn do it waste of money 
negative,product is sub par so many things bad is that enough for me to submit it terrible don buy it sound quality bluetooth and battery life sucks did mention all your recommendations that an honest review don buy this product 
positive,this is such huge upgrade from my old speakers the sound quality is sharp and the volume is loud enough that my neighbors might complain if keep this up got the red color which very happy with as well
neutral,wow the headset has incredible sound base will make your belly shake not all ambient noise is cancelled but can hear the tv and talking in the background all that for under 
positive,my son loves it

positive,worked perfectly
positive,this is my first high quality bluetooth speaker am totally blown away by the sound and the battery life bought the big red one and really like it the charge is much bigger than the charge have charge case and it tough fit this speaker is really cool 
neutral,charged this for hrs like instructed and could not get the mouse to work extremely disappointed and returning 
neutral,this was purchased for pc that occasionally gets used for gaming but nothing intensive on the like side is the backlit keys which are multi colored and bright and readable when all other lights are out in the room something have struggled to find in other purchased keyboards second is the sleep mode which immediately responds when key is depressed bringing the keyboard back to life and recording the initial keystroke to the screen have mid high corsair that cannot do that at times the price tag and battery life is way longer than the more expensive corsair my only dislike is the change the manufacturer made in the enter return key all of my other keyboards without exception have horizontal return key this one has moved the key with the forward slash mark to the row next to the quotation marks key allowing the return key to be vertical rather than horizontal for touch key typist this creates problem since the pinky finger now has an additional full key width space to cross to get the return key it did not have with other keyboards for gamers this is an acceptable inexpensive keyboard and well worth the money for touch typist you might want to pick something else as the change in the return key is very frustrating this is an update from original initial review device did not last year and stopped working altogether as did the expensive corsair have gone back to good wired keyboard 
neutral,good headset
neutral,i enjoy playing on my switch more but the headphones seem heavy and it hard to plug the usb cable at the same time as the aux 
neutral,i charged the mouse for over hours and never even charged it doesn even work turn it on and it blinks red have already started return waste of time and money

neutral,it was good
neutral,i am very disappointed with the quality of life this mouse has bought it and was only able to use it four or five times and it has been problem for me ever since ve charged it adequately and it won start not sure if its factory malfunction or not but it should still be working ve owned it for little over month now 
positive,this is great product for the price am not disappointed 
positive,when received there was mystery liquid on the number pad chose to assume maybe it was cleaning fluid of some sort wiped it off and moved on with my life its supposedly water proof per advertisement right keyboard works fine while plugged in and has quiet keys but will not hold charge advertised as bluetooth and has bluetooth connector but only working as wired keyboard at this point and the backlight is super dim even at the highest brightness maybe mine was faulty but personally do not recommend

neutral,nice comfy and also very smooth
positive,it was cheap and the lights are fun but it was cheap and doesn work great squeaky wheel as you re scrolling sometimes it doesn track well so that annoying but it gets the job done if your patient select different one 
positive,excellent overall quality of device crisp clean sound and has bass you can truly feel and its very loud definitely worth the money 
positive,this mouse is super cute it is lightweight and the color matched perfectly to the picture got dark gray to match my macbook pro the click is silent which love the led lights are bright and colorful there is also setting where you can just have red lights but love the color changing the only downside is that this mouse does not hold charge long enough to last my entire workday ve started switching it off when am away from my desk and that help some charging is simple though

neutral,bought two of these one for work and one for my personal computer in two different colors mouse worked great until the roller ball in each died one after couple months one after less than two days if you can live without the roller ball then highly recommend but if you use it heavily would look at different mouse

neutral,broke within days didn think of returning it just threw in the garbage 
neutral,i was looking for simple black led mouse for work and this one is exactly what was looking for it works great and have had no issues yet due to the size it can be little uncomfortable if you are doing lot of work using the mouse for an extended amount of time but this has only happened to me once 
neutral, wanted to update my review not only did this not last at all have received multiple emails from the distributor asking to remove my review promising an amazon gift card they gave multiple excuses of why the item doesn work clearly from all the recent reviews of this item they have not fixed any of it get almost daily emails from them asking to remove my review do not buy this item you will regret it was loving this mouse sleek design loved the rechargeable feature of it until one day came into work booted up my laptop and the mouse was no longer connecting to the computer tried to take out the usb of the computer and part of it was left stuck in the computer am now going to have to try to get the piece out of the usb port on my laptop and how about that my return window ended last week very frustrated and annoyed by this would not recommend this item

neutral,nice quality feel great under my fingers but brightnes not the best
positive,great product
positive,i bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading then realized the on off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions one click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear will say the white mouse is almost translucent the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse not just the sides it plug and play very easy to use and comfortable 
neutral,for online gaming and streaming
neutral,didn last worked for short while guess you get what you pay for 
positive,great headphones 
positive,great speaker good to very good sound quality charges phone quickly and it charges quickly as well am having replacement sent though due to only one speaker really sending out music the other is dull and crackled

positive,this mouse is very quiet when you click and is ergonomically comfortable 
positive,this is the second wireless mouse purchased both the same the first one works great have had it for while and love the look and feel the second one started sticking and locking up shortly after purchasing it hit or miss some days it fine other days want to throw it out the window 
positive,great sound quality great product within the price range
negative,the matte coating started peeling off within week or two of using it it still works well but looks terrible 
negative,this is the most inconsistent keyboard ever it worked fine for the first months but now it only seems to work when it wants to that terrible for gaming you ll be in game and out of nowhere your character is taking damage and you re like what the hell ive had this for about months and its already failing on me can recommend this 
neutral,i like the slim design and color 
positive,i really like that it comes with usb adapter saved my life because the new macbooks aren compatible with usb over all really nice mouse fits in my hand perfectly and love the lights on it 
positive,it functions very well as wireless mouse the usb adapter it comes with is very handy for the new apple computers which only have usb ports the lights are cool as well but more importantly the mouse is sturdy and doesn feel cheap 
neutral,liked the color
positive,wasn expecting much because it seemed low priced but have been using daily for work for about month now and it wonderful no issues actually bought two of them one grey and one gold and they both work fine

positive,love this mouse mouse came days before delivery eta which was always nice love that it rechargeable no more dead batteries mid work shift mouse connected right away to my thinkpad ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome mouse is low profile with really nice feel to it tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for longevity so far it for me do note with the white version the colors bleed through the top as you can see in the picture and video however still looks cool to me just different than the advertised photos 
neutral,may as well just leave it connected to the computer needs constant recharging 
positive,works as expected like the colors they puts little sunshine in my work day sleep mode is too quick for me but it wakes up quickly after good shake 
negative,is dead will not hold charge cheap but not worth what paid 
positive,love 
positive,these headphones are comfortable and affordable the quality is average but it is good enough for the price 
neutral,not what expected hate the sleep feature only stays lit for few seconds and there no way to by pass it wanted lit keyboard so can find the key need in the dark also would not recommend for gaming as the key strokes don always register

neutral,stopped working after few months and haven used it that often for it to not work
positive,i was left speachless when first played this speaker amazing sound incredible battery life something that ve noticed with the time that when doing the jbl connect thing when joining multiple speakers it goes crazy sometimes it freezes and must do hard shutdown 
positive,great looking gaming keyboard brought this for my son as starter
positive,works like it should and it super easy to set up 
positive,got these for my nephew and he soo happy the color is vibrant and we love that we can hear his game lol
negative,worked fine for weeks then let started randomly malfunctioning and getting stuck in the depressed position regardless of nothing being spilled on them nothing stuck under key etc frustrating issue for brand new product
neutral,this is not good headset but its only bucks so you get what you pay for 
neutral,i loved this mouse for the literal two weeks days that had it and it was working for no apparent reason the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working approximately five seconds after had last used it had not subjected it to any pressure or abuse of any sort was looking at document scrolled down continued reading tried to scroll down and nope in the lower ratings this seems to be common problem bummed really did love the mouse 
positive,best portable speaker the quality is amazing and so practical 
positive,i really like my new led wireless mouse it is easy to hold and it really to look at the led lights change colors and it works great as mouse it adds some fun to your normal day love it 
neutral,wanted to match my keyboard and not spend too much money this little number is priced just right and the size and shape make it easy to use 
positive,battery life and sound quality are great very happy with my purchase 
positive,the sound quality is extraordinary and the battery life is also great
positive,really great little mouse good clicking and control the battery lasts me days at work between charges get this mouse 
positive,perfect headphones for the price excellent quality 
neutral,has problems charging and rarely works
positive,i like the change in color but this is definitely not gaming mouse needed an alternative to keep me in the works so chose something that was cheap and nice looking its silent and has nice speed to it not too much sensitivity 
neutral,as soon as got it never would shut off was barely louder then my jbl flip noticed awhile ago that no sound comes from the right side of the speakeridk if this is just faulty system or if its every speaker but for the money paid definitely not worth it
neutral,it works but within reason this review is relative to what you re looking to get out of the speaker for myself it not loud enough and as the battery levels deplete so does the quality and volume of sound 
neutral,this crapped out within three months invest in better quality mouse so tedious having to replace these cheap electronics so often 
positive,love it 
neutral,came broke out of box sound quality good but mic function
neutral,nice
positive,the mouse worked great for just over month then the charging port detached from the mouse yes came right out no longer have the ability to charge it this was probably glitch with my individual unit otherwise would have given it stars 
positive,i enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up but that is essentially it the battery storage on the mouse is super low so you ll have to plug it in any way after about half hour of use maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow led light feature the mouse scroll wheel broke on me in middle of game not any aggressive game mind you just house decorating sim and ve hardly used it for the six or so months ve had it to sum up for quick cheap purchase it looks great but isn worth it in the long run and regret not buying different mouse 
positive,using this for my work laptop receieved afternoon friday and used for little bit and pleased put up laptop for the weekend went to use it today monday and non responsive tried everything and still not working this thing is junk 
positive,bought this mouse for my wife to use with her new macbook air must say this mouse has exceeded all expectations very happy with my purchase and will refer anyone looking for quality mouse to this business 
neutral,it does not move correctly when you move the mouse the cursor doesn move same thing when you click on something you have to click million times before it opens up what your doing or closes what your doing 
positive,this device is simply awesome for gaming 
neutral,the usb receiver was missing upon opening which was the main reason got this mouse tried using it with another laptop and after fully charging it it would not work after charging for hours and hours again it still would not work very disappointed 
neutral,i like that can cancel out all the background noise and distractions when play on my ps 
neutral,i ve been using this mouse for couple of months to do online schooling and now in person classes as well haven had any problems lights make it cute works for all need it to 
neutral,it broke after having it for months it was nice when first got it but no one could hear me when talked into the mic 
neutral,sound quality for entertainment
neutral,be sure your computer is on in order to see the lights on the white mouse was so close to returning it as my other mouse with lights was always on regardless of my computer but glad problem solved my own problem 
positive,works great
neutral,can pair any device because the bluetooth button is not working 
neutral,i work from home and in the office have to transport my laptop and mouse have forgotten my mouse more time that can remember at the office bought of these so can keep at home and at the office they only hold charge for less than week it might have to do with it having lights on it but my other mouse holds charge of heavy usage for month will not buy again as need something to hold charge much longer 
positive,these speakers are great the bass sounds wonderful
neutral,i bought this speaker for my boyfriend for christmas and the bluetooth button is already broken 
positive,very cool design thanks
negative,i ve bought of these mouses when the first one broke thought it might just have been dud really liked the mouse up until that point so decided to get another one it been weeks and the same issues with both mouses the scroll button broke while the mouse does still technically work it super inconvenient and annoying 
positive,this is by far the best speaker ve ever had sticking with this brand for while 
positive,i like it it comfortable it half as much as the one was buying and does exactly the same thing and the pretty lights make it good to look at also 
neutral,i haven had it long and it just stop working it not in sleep mode it also says that the port has used all it space for the usb 
neutral,i have macbook and it would not connect have charged the mouse for hours and still will not connect 
positive,i could not get it to play the chat audio and the gameplay audio to both works at the same time but think it was problem with my xbox and not the headset the headset itself was great the price is considered it is an amazing deal 
positive,the click isn loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder the battery doesn last near long enough not even whole day even when you don have the lights on it does feel nice in the hand it does track well but would say mouse pad isn optional with this one 
positive,great gaming headset for kids who need it 
neutral,when plug the usb into the computer it takes away my internet settings cannot connect to the internet and it shows no networks to connect to don know how to fix it 
neutral,hp laptop compat
positive,really like the way this wireless mouse feels acts my last one died and now almost glad it did so could buy this love the led light color changing when it in use and the auto shutdown when it not it performed well and moves easily great value too 
positive,i would recommend this headset we have been very satisfied 
positive,this speaker is great the sound is so crystal clear we were in disbelief the first time we used it we love taking it to the beach and my fiance always takes it golfing with his friends the only thing would change is to make it lighter it is somewhat heavy and bulky wish it was thinner and lighter 
neutral,love this but it looses its juice within hours without it being plugged in work hour shift so have to plug it in during very busy shift so need one with battery
negative,was deciding between this and ue boom went with the boom first and it just didnt have that deep bass and sound personally like but this charge does night and day on that battery im not sure yet haven ran it more than hrs at time but so far no issues glad got this one

positive,it works great for what use it for bring it into my shop when working on my projects or bring it into the bathroom when want to relax in my jacuzzi tub it is plenty loud but wish it had equalizer on the app to adjust the bass 
neutral,the keypad tends to leave off some letters after prolonged use had to keep retyping some letters and in some cases it actually doubled up on the letters the charge doesn last long either all in all am somewhat satisfied with it but believe it has few inherent flaws 
positive,amazing sound and battery life can wait to take it to the beach this summer

neutral,beware this mouse did not hold up it wouldn charge correctly after week had to return 
positive,for the money this mouse is great value needed new mouse as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to miss wanted something fairly inexpensive wireless and rechargeable am tired of having to switch out batteries this mouse fit all those perfectly my first month impression is it excellent after the initial charge it still going strong with maybe an hour day usage after weeks it goes to sleep after period of inactivity which helps to conserve the battery my only gripe would be the slim profile think prefer little more bulk in my palm my only contact with the mouse when navigating is with my fingers no palm contact this does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as slim profile design all in am glad purchased this mouse if this company develops full contoured model would surely upgrade 
neutral,it cool looking mouse but only lasted months until it stopped working 
positive,the jbl charge is great product found it to be initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature have found that the highs aren totally accurate but they re close enough to not distract you from the music the highs are present but definitely aren strong which adds to the warm signature the mids are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device because of this the vocals are great in most songs they are well represented unless they sneak up on the high notes which is when you can hear slight distortion from accuracy however the vocals which dip into lower range sound really good as the speaker does great job not to put too much emphasis on the radiators making it sound bassy and unrealistic if you listen to high quality hifi tracks you ll be able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound stage as for the mono speaker don listen to the critics of this new implementation because most of them either don know what they re talking about or they are just picking at it because they don like the thought of it you re not going to get stereo by using speakers inches apart like on the last model and as for separation this mono speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows the speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamics all the way to just under full volume ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge xb xb xb extreme onyx and what ve found is that while the highs are bit lacking in certain songs it certainly makes up for it in other departments the bass is very good in the charge the bass notes are represented accurately and it able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can however it worth mentioning it still no sub this speaker has trouble representing very low frequencies the radiators start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don know this doesn sound very good the battery life of this speaker wasn as advertised and found could only get hours on percent volume which isn bad but is huge deviation from the claimed hours after using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers ve actually grown fond of this unit and it become my beach toy don take any critics in this review too seriously as doubt most people are as critical as me when it comes to audio but this one gets my thumbs up future improvements would definitely require tweeter and possibly bigger battery 
positive,i bought this for my boyfriend who games and uses it for work he loves it it looks great quiet keys that are very responsive he can also use it from the couch when he hooks the computer up to the tv the usb is behind table and on the bottom shelf of our entertainment about feet away while was writing this asked him if he had an criticisms and he said that it charges fine but the charger can feel like it hard to get in or not in all the way but again no issues charging just be mindful of that 
positive,the user was not expecting rechargeable keyboard and has been pleasantly surprised by this one the bells and whistles haven been main draw past the first day or two fiddling with the colors performance wise this keyboard has been standing up well to normal business use and the recharge at night is not onerous it just one last thing to do before heading out for the day no big deal

positive,it work super great recommend for other to buy
positive,my son love it want buy one to me now we are autistic works lot for us 
neutral,the micro usb to usb adapter does not work you are better off ordering mouse that connects directly to the computer via direct bluetooth that does not need receiver 
neutral,this is the second one of these we purchased lasted years of daily use the cord is wearing out effecting the sound where it plugs in 
positive,my kkim keyboard was about two years old and it suddenly wouldn work contact klim via email seeking tech assistance and they promptly replied and offered several suggestions to potentially solve the pry unfortunately none of these worked and they informed me that they would ship me new keyboard it arrived in two days and it has been working perfectly since received klim service and commitment was outstanding and will use their products whenever my needs can be met with suitable klim product roark

positive,slim profile love that it doesn need battries colorful 
negative,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was unresponsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hub with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning packaged the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door handles now we have to take it to drop off location because return pickup is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller 
negative, at this point call this false advertising bought this to use on discord unless you have room for feet of cable and want to have that garbled my mike will never work sound quality don bother buying this piece of junk not to mention there are just so many things to plug in it cheaply made and get something better at dollar general waste of time

negative,used this mouse twice went to use it third time and it was completely dead the led were still working but the mouse light underneath flickers then shuts off after being turned on waste of money 
positive,ya know for almost thought be more impressed sound quality isn bad but the bass interferes with the sound quality and makes it wobbly to where scared to play it loud ue doesn do that like others mentioned too it is mono speaker which isn great when looking for full directional quality sound
neutral,these do not work for what needed them for we bought them to plug into ps controller and they do not connect 
negative,i love the mouse it great fit for me it has options for both hands is quiet and the color ordered mint green is exactly what was shown what wanted the led lights run briefly when that option is selected but then seem to shut off thought they would run continuously maybe if use it for longer periods it could have an effect ll see what happens the biggest issue is that the usb adapter does not fit in my computer or my phone the little pamphlet that comes with the mouse says to contact their customer service email first with any questions problems emailed them the day got the mouse four days ago but so far have no response 
positive,good sound good headphones
positive,love this product really fits my personality and does its job great 
neutral,i ve enjoyed using this keyboard but one big problem seem to be running into is the battery life have other wireless keyboards that will last week before have to recharge them using this one for about the same about of time have been having to recharge it multiple times week not sure if the backlight is draining the battery that much but that seems like major difference some of the keys sometimes stick or don seem to respond unless you press them very hard 
neutral,i like the compact shape and the changing light bar around it 
negative,the keys would do the wrong function and it was missing several options 
neutral,bought these for my son for his bday ordered them ahead of time and put back by the time he received these as gift they worked for whole weeks and the sound went out in them highly disappointed that couldn swap out since they were out of that time frame seller reached out about giving refund if edited or removed comment back in february and haven received any update and it almost may definitely not worth the money

positive,i just love this bluetooth speaker did lot of research on different units and this one came out on top for me great sound battery life and looks 
neutral,after bought day later my daughter fell down and its not working now 
positive,the mouse came as described with the option chose however after letting it charge for the recommended time before use it would not connect to my computer turned it off and then back on and it worked for about minutes within that minutes only showed one color the whole time it never worked again afterwards just went and bought mouse from walmart and it works like perfect even more sturdier than this one don waste your money on this 
negative,if could give stars would paid for same day delivery and showed up days late finally get them and the sound quality is bad and there was loud static coming from the headset
positive,one of the best speakers in the market right now 
positive,this was good mouse got as gift and really liked it until it didn work anymore after while it stoped working and looked at some other reviews that said they got defective one well guess did and they are kinda common to be defective so would only risk buying it if you want the mouse decent amount would say you re chance of it being broken is like also it only stops working after like days so you won know until then if you buy it also did like that they added usb adapter in the box use they adapter for something else now 
neutral,i used for mins and it stopped working the lights were on my pc detected the dongle but mouse didn work initiated the return
neutral,purchase this for my grandson he takes excellent care of all of his gaming equipment unfortunately these only lasted couple weeks and stopped working very disappointed because cannot get refund or an exchange
negative,i going back to basic and battery operated lost charge at inconvenient times then started being temperamental on taking charge now it won take charge at all worthless to me waste of time and money 
neutral,i won waste money on these with no batteries ever again junk
positive,you can really beat the price it actually little nicer than was anticipating given what paid would say it worth the price just this with my chromebook for my online classes the light is really cute too 
positive,well for starters you can beat the price of true wireless computer keyboard like most of the other reviews didn care for the battery life so after losing power one night and the battery had died in the keyboard looked over to my power bank and said to myself why not not only does it work can sit on the couch about feet or so from the tv and don need to worry about the keyboard battery life nor having super long charging cable knocks on wood so far the keyboard has been holding up and can say that it has paid for its self the only issue have with it is the enter button like to make emoji faces and every time go to make one always do instead other then that great budget friendly keyboard 
positive,this keyboard feels really smooth and the rainbow backlit feature works really well highly recommend this keyboard to those looking for wireless keyboard that they want to use for gaming or for other reasons 
positive,works as expected great product which use at work all the time
positive,it really great keyboard the only thing don like is that you are unable to change the color other than that it perfect 
positive,great bought for child and he loves it works exactly as advertised he says their comfortable and he can hear everything like how it has the audio jack and usb usb is just for the power to the lights so he can use them on his tablet or the computer 
positive,these headphones replaced another pair that just didn last these are working great and appear very durable and stylish my son loves them 
neutral,you cannot turn the speaker off without it making loud noise they know it annoying it meant to get you to install the app if you install the app giving up more of yourself to them in other words they let you turn it off think it meant to be annoying because even if you turn the volume down to and cannot hear anything else it will still make loud noise when turning off they want you to not be able to turn it off quietly for example when you were listening to some thing in bed and forgot to turn it off and later on want to turn it off quietly works fine otherwise the one star is just cause think it fair to penalize such behavior 
positive,the only adjustment personally needed to make was learning to work the sleep mode and click the button to wake it back up other than that love this mouse for work the lights on it still work almost months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into standard micro usb cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about days usually just end the evening plugging in to micro usb port and am always good to go grat buy and will replace with the same when the time comes 
positive,i use the headphones for gaming and they seem perfectly fine no issues sound is clear headphones are comfortable and mic works as advertised nicely done 
neutral,used for gaming

positive,the mouse is very easy to use and automatically connected to the computer would definitely recommend this mouse to others 
neutral,do not buy it this mouse stopped working they built it enough to last few months so it out of amazon return policy after that it doesn work 
neutral,slightly annoying that it had to be recharged to even use it but the design is sleek good size and quiet 
positive,great keyboard my son loves it

neutral,it needs to be charged daily as use it all day at work do like the color changing light it brightens up my day 
positive,i was surprised to find out how well these actually are they handle bass very well and the audio is clear and loud you can have the lights on or off and they look pretty cool if you re looking for good quality headset without spending lot of money these are great option 
neutral,i needed new mouse for my laptop decided to wire less must and rechargeable this fits all my needs plus an automatic setup

neutral,good mouse for the price 
positive,i work from home and this mouse is very comfortable and responsive 
neutral,i use it in my class as move around classroom click the mouse to move on with my presentation good so far 
negative,this mouse is very light weight but not in good way it so light it actually feels cheap it takes lot of getting use to because it is so light after about three weeks the mouse started to intermittently stop working now it has fully stopped working after only month pay the more and get the microsoft one ve had that one for years and never had an issue 
neutral,grandson say they work good
positive,needs better battery life but overall good wireless mouse great customer service but they will contact if leave bad review 
positive,both sounds and bass are great quality was outside the other day listening to music from my phone and had neighbor come by from houses down opposite side of the street asking me to turn it up laughed and said it was already on the highest volume impressed with how far the sound carried 
neutral,the keyboard looks and feels nice to use however have barely uses this keyboard and am encountering connection issues open up web browser go to start typing and nothing happens turn it off and on again wait few seconds then again start typing it doesnt type then again few seconds and it registered letters other times it functions properly too unrealiable 
positive,great headset for gaming my daughter uses it while playing xbox and talking to her friends works great and would definitely recommend 
neutral,i use this all the time battery life seems good
neutral,this product is nice and easy to use but the sound quality isnt the best id much rather go with some turtle beach headphones or just earbuds all together 
negative,i received this and tried to use it and it lags all over the computer screen it is horrible it very pretty but does not work even tried to charge it for two entire days and still lags 
positive,i really like the glossy shiny look to it love the color of the blue and it fits pretty comfortably do think that the mic could come down bit lower it feels little bit short 
positive,we have been extremely pleased with this mouse we have an hp laptop it works wonderfully with it 
positive,i have small bluetooth speaker and was looking for one bit bigger for an upcoming trip wanted something that could fill living room and kitchen with some decent sound first bought the soundcore flare and while liked the sound and eq settings on the app it just didn fill the room with full sound the jbl might be bit narrower on the soundstage the overall quality and low end were enough to seal the deal also like you can connect two devices at once the charge has nice heft to it and the construction is solid definitely feel like got my money worth pros solid bass even sound quality construction connect two devices at once battery life seems good usb port for charging the speakercons soundstage bit narrow app has no eq settings
neutral,looks so cool
positive,a bit heavy and awkward but would expect that at this price point my only real complaint is in the cord design am using with ps and the cord splits in one is mm jack that plugs into the controller and supplies the sound which works fine the other is usb jack that supplies power to the led lights and should plug into the console the problem is that the cord splits at the last inches or so if you want to use the usb for the lights you need to either buy separate usb extension or keep your controller at least inches from your console which is very impractical if not impossible just bad design it should split much further up the cord so that both can plug in to their appropriate places at the same time had stars but lowered to because don like companies that offer money for reviews they ve been sending incessant emails saying they will refund if remove my review how about you just make decent product my integrity can be bought for 
positive,the mouse is comfortable it easy to click it doesn get stuck or it isn too loose or too hard the mouse itself is good size for my hands the colors are very vibrant and pretty they are soothing to see thank you for the complimentary mouse pad it was thoughtful 
positive,really brings the sound to life the sound quality is by far the best compared to other headsets 
positive,this product is cheap and does not last long after only one day of use plug it into the outlet and it does not turn on needed gaming mouse and this one is definitely not it extremely upset
positive,the mouse feels alright in hand but mine has an issue of pulling the cursor to the top left looks of the mouse are good though and the lights are subtle yet cool 
positive,great item for my year old gaming 
negative,put one star because this store sent me bad mouse twice the first was working then not working the next did not work at all just wasted time and money 
positive,i use this with my macbook pro and it works great very quiet and smooth 
neutral,i like this for school
positive,fast shipping great price awesome new high quality bluetooth speaker at great discount
neutral,very quiet also very easy to set up 
neutral,product was great for the first two months it suddenly just stopped working even though its fully charged kinda of disappointment 
positive,great for the boat camping apartment etc connection via bluetooth is easy not much to say besides you get what they advertise 
positive,i really needed mouse because it is so much easier when working from my laptop searched on amazon and came across this vibrant mouse fell in love and decided to buy it it was the best decision because this mouse is fantastic and works perfectly love the color variations and the sleek look it is easy to setup use and also easy to charge it is also wireless which makes it even better 
neutral,well enough
positive,excellent
positive,product is great and works well
positive,i find this mouse easy to use fits my hand very well wear medium sized glove and moves fairly smoothly say fairly smooth because used mouse pad with smooth soft surface it seemed to drag just little when tried smooth hard surface it worked better you do have to click button to wake up the mouse when it goes to sleep mode my other one woke up with just moving it thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but dont even notice it would probably buy again 
positive,it lights up very pretty but is very laggy doesn track very good with cursor can deal with that since use mine for work so switched back to the mouse my company sent me 
positive,good quality and comfortable at low cost 
neutral,long lasting power recharges fast
positive,like design look feel soft touch silent click sleep feature single click to wake it up dislike it loses the charge bit quicker than prefer but works welledited from original review would recommend
positive,great mouse works just as described unfortunately the charging cable didn work thank goodness we have extras great purchase tho 
neutral,gets loud but based on previous reviews assumed it would be loud sound quality is decent however turned up it has problems don think you can get better bass out of bluetooth speaker this size however still want bit more 
neutral,excelente
positive, so for bucks this is pretty good headset noise cancellation isn too bad the sound quality is really good actually actually would buy this again for bucks is not bad at all 
negative,i have macbook and this mouse required two plugins since take my mac with me the chances of these plugins being lost was pain 
positive, gorgeous design and nice quality
positive,it was so good bought another in teal 
positive,cute and functional bought them as stocking stuffers liked mine so much 
negative,this keyboard may look cool but that about it the keys are not button like like the one brand normally use so typing with average size nails is difficult it makes way too much noice for my comfort am returning the product because it doesn meet my expectations 
positive,i never had wireless mouse before and wow blown away that the chord had been cut and free to have total control from such great distance great ergonomic design and also has lights that flash and can charge it with no more batteries love this mouse 
neutral,good for the money
neutral,low quality not worth more than led lighting is fixed colors 
positive, this is so cute love how it changes colors it is small but not too small 
positive,works well and as expected packaging is nice and is pretty simple plug and play do wish it would have solid back light feature and not just the rainbow multi colored as think it would look more professional for an office setting but other wise im pleased with it 
neutral,this head so it was not that company when first got it well the texture of it feels nice it seems like it doesn fit my head right this isn that tight on the ears doesn seem noise canceling another thing noticed while using this for gaming is if there are sounds one way you will hear it on all sides with no direction very hard to use and play competitively second issue have found with this headset is that it is very bad at picking up noise and have found myself yelling trying to talk to my teammates with them still barely being able to hear me returned it and do not recommend this headset 
positive,the smaller flip is not only louder but sounds better due to speakers instead of the mono speaker in the charge 
neutral,for year the mouse did well however it eventually needed charged in less time frames it finally shorted out this was my nd purchase after the first shorted out within few weeks permanent sleep mode 
positive,needed new mouse for my laptop something that was easy to store and easy to use the mouse is easy to set up battery life is satisfactory and dpi choice is good the led colors are nice touch too
positive,love it 
positive,this mouse has met all of my requirements when my old wireless mouse began to die opted for this rechargeable one because was sick of batteries this has very long battery life as use it for up to hours in row use it for gaming league of legends and it works perfectly no lag and it crazy cute to boot with all of it colours and such haven had it very long about month and half but very happy with it so far 
neutral,when my old headset stopped working as well needed to quickly get replacement so could continue streaming and making content this did the job well enough 
positive,feels nice in the hand lightweight but not lightly made if that makes sense smooth flow nice to have the usb compartment inside of the mouse use it for my latop when travel
positive,perfect
neutral,in the second week it stoped to work and the item is very light wouldn never buy it again or from this seller
positive,bought it for my son he loves it especially all the lights that light up
neutral,had to return them the speaker quality was poor 
positive,great sound love it 
neutral,really good sound and also charge your phone
neutral,won connect to my dell laptop running windows and not computer illiterate moron either this mouse just flashes red light twice and doesn connect the system shows it connected but doesn recognize returning to spend an extra ten bucks for name brand mouse that will work 
positive,my great granddaughter likes them
neutral,one thing to know is that you can have lights on if you are using this for ps
negative,i have now purchased of these computer mice both of which have broken and become unusable within just few weeks with the first one thought got defective item so returned it and got the same model again for exchange now that one has broken too conveniently just days outside the return window in both instances the click wheel stopped functioning making scrolling impossible these were handled with care in my home office and not used improperly or dropped or exposed to moisture etc they just seem very cheaply made the led lights were nice feature but meaningless without functioning mouse as far as the ergonomics often found my hand hurting the mouse is so low profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver do not recommend this product 
negative,these are perfect the quality and durability its beyond perfect thought because it was low priced that it would break simply but it didnt it fits perfectly and doesn irritate my ears 
positive,the sound is awesome and has very good bass what like most is that it is rechargeable by usb connection and it is small enough to carry inside small backpack nevertheless the sound is loud enough to be heard across sq ft apartment or more and between walls great speaker for the money 
positive,great product for the price 
positive,i love it connects quick and bluetooth range is good good sound 
positive,i like this keyboard very much but was hoping for something bit smaller or thinner per se it normal size keyboard little larger than expected 
negative,this speaker sounded awesome until it didn started turning off on its own spent tons of hours troubleshooting called the company and they couldn even find my device by serial number they were completely useless offered me off coupon to buy another piece of crap speaker this speaker was gift will never purchase jbl product there are too many other products on the market to deal with defective equipment and piss poor service don believe me google reviews for jbl pulse tons of issues buy another brand 
negative,poor quality cheap breaks quickly doesn last long on full charge charging port already broke 
negative,so bad quality and uncomfortable
neutral,junk
positive,bought them for the grand kids for christmas they absolutely love them they use them on their phones on the tablets and also gaming me quality is great 
neutral,while this keyboard is good it not silent like the description says also the shape of the enter key is awkward and don like it but that is from personal perspective on like dislike for the shape it by no means takes away from the effectiveness of the keyboard will be looking for another one similar to this one maybe even the same brand 
neutral,after three weeks the microphone stopped working
positive,lights are multicolored and are nice goes to sleep on its own and is great smooth and works fine until it breaks had it months and days and suddenly while scrolling the wheel broke
positive,liked everything about this headset great sound 
positive,i was bit skeptical about it being quiet clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet the clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the click my only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly the lights are enjoyable but don display constant stream of colors as they forcibly manually change when moved or clicked they otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle overall it really nice mouse to buy and use comfortable and light kind of reminds me of the apple mouse 
positive,son wanted pair microphone phone to play with his son these are really nice earphones he really likes them beautiful blue color 
neutral,like it so much bought second one 
positive,works great only have to charge it once every weeks and use it daily at the office 
positive,i love this mouse easy to set up easy to use it seems to go forever on one charge and the ever changing light color is really cool 
neutral,i liked the color
neutral,it works as expected 
positive,was ready to use right out of the box great sound quality 
positive,the sound quality is decent but the mic doesn work that well so if you need mic to play with friends wouldn recommend this 
neutral,ergonomic and nice
neutral,sound was not as bold as had hoped 
neutral,sleek good battery backup auto sleep led lights silent clicks
positive,totally shocked at how clear sounding it is it definitely gets loud was very impressed with the life of battery however now know why it last if you are not playing anything after awhile it automatically shuts itself off kind of nice feature we like it because of the bluetooth and use it while driving in our rv we have an older motorhome and it doesn have fancy radio with gps or bluetooth so this portable speaker works great however using gps google maps from phone is nice but while traveling it may only speak an hour later well the speaker will shut itself off if nothing comes through in an hour so to fix that we just listen to sirius via bluetooth by phone and when google gps needs to give directions it just cuts through music to announce what ever so it works out great 
positive,it good but for gaming don recommend this slim one it ok for normal work 
positive,i use this keyboard for my ps as play mostly at night and needed quieter way to play online with people this does just the trick and is just more comfortable and quicker for me to type on than those tiny keyboard attachments for controllers my only small complaint as others have mentioned is some colored keys are easier to see than others but overall it hasn been significant issue and serves its purpose 
positive,i bought it for my husbands christmas present but he cannot wait to open it and he is happy with it 
positive,great sound quality and noise canceling abilities comfortable
positive,this wireless rechargeable mouse is exactly what wanted its light and just the right size for my laptop with so many options on amazon glad chose this product and the sleep mode function and colors are really cool would recommend this product to anyone looking for awesome mouse 
neutral,did not work with my older dell computer
positive,sound isn that great rather unimpressed should have spent more money and bought better 
positive,i have no complaints about this mouse use it daily and it works great love the fact it has led lights recommend this product 
neutral,works as expected 
positive,easy to use only took couple hours to first charge looks cute 
positive,hopefully mine was the outlier because mine was bricked on arrival power button only lit up while plugged in and even then none of the buttons would function and the unit would not play music even when showing full battery have flip already which love and am highly disappointed had to get refund expected better from jbl
positive,works very well on any surface colors flow well well worth the money 
positive,amazing sound quality and pretty making handling and experience awesome
positive,love love love this thing even at low volumes it has full range of sound own an older bose sound link mini whose sound it also superb but this charge has far louder range bought it for around the home use and our annual trips to the philippines where things tend to get wet on the beach being quite waterproof that shouldn be an issue with the charge the bluetooth connects easily and quickly no toggling on and off to get it to work as with some older bluetooth speakers haven used it long enough but the battery shouldn be any sort of problem at all since it mah which means it allowed on planes overall extremely pleased 
neutral,the keys are very soft when hitting which makes for nice feel to keyboard like that the sleep mode kicks in after minute or so of no use translating to longer battery life before having to plug in and charge the color does only stay at one spot it doesn breathe or anything will update in couple of weeks if needed 
neutral,it good mouse worked very well for the time had it driver broke after two months and it doesn work anymore 
neutral,i like the sleek feeling and the multi colour while in use and very very soft clicks 
positive,i use this at work and it works perfectly
neutral,these are horrible if you are gamer these are not for you invest in better
neutral,this mouse is very slow in reaction not sensitive to the movement and make my hand tiring already after minutes usage too bad only start using it after the return window closed 
positive,this is the perfect headset for gaming great product for the price 
positive,update one of the keyboards was dropped once and the spacebar ceased to function that was total loss the other one bought lasted years and worked great during that time then the spacebar also stopped working was not dropped paid for it and it now so opted for different model this time and like it very much it asin bmqhh if you want to search it previous review not sure if this is really gaming keyboard but needed something that lights up when all my lights are out this does the job do wish it ran on batteries but hopefully the charging connector won poop out on me one charge lasted quite while my favorite part of this keyboard is the light noise the keys make the spacebar is bit noisier but the rest of the buttons have pleasant tapping sound without being very clacky like some gaming keyboards waited about months for prices to go down and ordered to of these by accident when found the deal keeping both 
positive,great little wireless speaker would recommend buying it
neutral,the reason why this product has good reviews is because the seller told buyers to vote them many stars and they will get the gift as commission however they just scam buyers 
positive,great product
positive,good battery life and good quality sound
negative,the sound quality is not that good used it couple of time and felt like either it is faulty or it just the sound quality of charge is not good 
positive,just great product works perfect fits nice sounds good and feels good 
positive,needs better battery life but overall good wireless mouse great customer service but they will contact if leave bad review 
positive,the headset is very comfy in general and it fits on my head you re able to extend it and it pretty good the noise cancellation could be better but it still works the mic is little too short and the mic could be better the sound quality is very good but am unsure how good it is compared to other headsets it is good nonetheless and would recommend it very good for its price
neutral,my son loves his headset but don keep throwing them and being rough will break
neutral,worked great while it lasted the roller wheel stopped working first week back to school after summer break the roller wheel just spins in place one of the arms snapped it has been kept in protective pouch 
positive,got this for me and my boyfriend he really likes them and like them as well they are very loud kinda hurts my ears and mic quality is also great definitely recommend
positive,absolutely love this speaker great sound clarity would highly recommend 
neutral,nice light cool not brightness expected but decent price stars
positive,this keyboard is awesome it also has year warranty which the company is very legit my keyboard charger didn seem to work so they sent me new one with candy lol thanks klim 
positive,decent sound quality directional sound works well mic is little quiet but you can easily fix this in settings on the windows pc am using so no problems there the usb seems miscellaneous unless you want them to light up which is kinda cool honestly lol but would be nice if the usb extension was removeable
positive,great mouse like the colors and how easy it was to connect to my laptop and tablet so can play baldurs gate on my tablet way easier now charging doesn take long at all either some with large hands may not like it to much it is bit smaller
positive,works very well best part is charging the mouse through power chord rather than batteries 
neutral,the product is good but very pricey have seen similar products for less 
positive,perfect for gaming and talking to friends in games 
positive,i probably should have known but the light is either red or it cycles through colors this is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids would rather be able to pick color but that is not feature available which is probably something should have expected but was being hopeful 
positive,nice little mouse have gotten compliments on it functions as expected 
positive,i like that it recharges and doesn require batteries it doesn last that long though but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even minutes wish it came with longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in still can but very short cord 
neutral,the red lights on these headsets are wickedly cool 
neutral,the headsets volume is terrible and the people you play with will barely be able to hear you even if you max the output volume on it the sound quality is also terrible as it randomly amplifies certain sounds and makes everyone sound like they are talking into cup overall dont buy this even though its cheap it is not worth as you wont be able to even function with this hunk of junk 
positive,very good sound quality can hear very clearly without background noise also like how the wire is long enough so im not constantly pulling on it 
positive,i not much of gamer but got these for work conference calls because my computer mic is terrible the first thing noticed is that they felt like they were made with cheap plastic the ear cushions are super stiff and they don seem to get worn in after using them even though don game too much still have some multi hour sessions on gta at night and use these so dont wake up my house the sound is good but the ear cushions really start hurting my ears after prolonged usage if you re looking for comfort go elsewhere the overall sound is good not great absolutely no noise cancelling functions 
neutral,it doesn work
positive,super cute and so easy to use love that it so slim too 
positive,got it to use my laptop while have it hooked to the tv works perfect for my needs 
positive,for the prices they are great
positive,i bought and we love them
positive,very loud and sounds super clear bought this as gift for my dad and he obsessed with it
neutral,cheap for reason doesnt work after months guess that is why the return policy is just days do not waste your time on this item complete garbage 
positive,my son loved them 
neutral,works okay kept going to sleep on me even while just reading webpage for too long and would have to turn it on and off again easy to navigate and like the design but it was pain keeping it on 
neutral,use for two weeks then it stop working tried charging it and everything 
positive,love the sound portability and the look of the speaker good value for the money 
negative,i bought this in november and it stopped working in january it also feels cheaply made should ve know this it does not charge ve charge it for long time multiple times it barely turned on before it died again piece of garbage 
positive,this keyboard is great the room work in can get pretty dark and the backlit keys are so fun and functional the usb cord broke and asked customer service what should look for to replace it and they sent me free one free of charge had another keyboard that used while waited for the cord and this one is so much better the keys feel good and can type fast without missing letters great value great keyboard and great customer service 
neutral,worked for less than month it won charge real piece of junk not great product 
neutral,did not tell us we needed adapter when we ordered it was not compatible alone for xbox not cool 
positive,i am really disappointed with this keyboard at first it was great but within month or two the keyboard started to glitch certain buttons do not work when press them considering the price of the product was happy but not if it stops working after two months 
positive,the perfect cute little mouse update had this mouse for little less than month which was so perfect and then stopped working definitely wasted my money 
positive,picked up bluetooth fast and sound quality is amazing
positive,great product mouse is exactly as advertised on the site highly recommended 
neutral,the only thing dislike is the fact of they have to be plugged in power supply
positive,i really loved this mouse but months in and it not working it lights up but does not function with my laptop super disappointed 
neutral,i really liked the mouse but it broke after few months it does not follow my commands eg copy and paste 
positive,works great highly recommend this product nothing to dislike 
neutral,fast shipping and good quality
positive,the bass was little bit of let down but compared to any speaker ve ever had including my beats pill it great hear all the dimensions in the music 
positive,this little speaker has great bass and all around good deal 
neutral,the keyboard itself was lit up it was charged tried multiple usb ports and rebooted my computer also tried on another computer did not want to seem to connect wirelessly also in an attempt to get it to work thought that possibly wiring it to my computer using the charging usb port it might work just not wirelessly which did not then went through amazon tech and am now returning the product think ill be looking for another brand because im still in need of wireless backlit keyboard
positive,purchased this as gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it he takes it everywhere while he working and the battery life is great definitely good purchase 
negative,i hate this mouse doesn stay charged and sleep mode kicks in too quickly
negative,item worked fine for month or two of light use and all the sudden it just doesn work thought the battery was dead soni charged it nothing if turn the switch off and on again it lights up for about millisecond goes dark again keys work tried to contact amzon becuse the only option it gives is return but am outside of the day window but there not taking phone calls at this time guess wasted money this one they do have an updated version keyboard that came out with right after purchased this one but wouldnt waste my money after this bad experience 
positive,this product is good for its price the set up was very quick for tech savvy like myself it was easy to figure out its settings and such however when was trying out keyboards shortcuts such as ctrl or ctrl on windows cmd or cmd for macos it wasn working with this keyboard you have to click windows button fn or whatever shortcut you have to pressed to enable its function it took me awhile by pressing random buttons haha hope this helps other consumers 
positive,this is nice size mouse and love the color and lights you have to charge it overnight if you use it all day like do for work 
positive,great sound for the price the only thing that stinks you got to have the usb plug in for the headphones to light up other then that it won light up but the headphones still work
neutral,get the next size up sound volume is weak
positive,worked good for the first months used the mouse on security camera hard drive to review camera footage worked fine one time and after that no cursor icon appeared tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available it won select anything only right click works but can scroll to selection luckily my desktop is touch screen so manually opened up the drives properties and it said that all device functions are working properly clearly not being able to see cursor is an issue 
neutral,easy to use wonderful look and feel feel that it could be bit brighter the company answered and solved my problem with in an hour the problem was my mistake but they helped me out anyways 
positive,love the size of it
positive,i work from home and this mouse is very comfortable and responsive 
neutral,worth it
positive,i have an xbox and the volume does work but how come my friends can hear me 
negative,i thought had to keep charging this work hour days and it hasn died on me yet charged it time in week 
positive,the mouse was shipped fast and the packaging was in good condition the pairing was fast and easy spent on razer mouse with the same functions and lighting it broke in six months very happy with my purchase 
positive,love this speaker made my daughter soo happy
positive,great for gaming
positive,just got new macbook it works well with it good quality for the price 
neutral,mouse was just ok the usb adapter didn work at all junk parts 
neutral,good quality
positive,the mid and high range is bit lower than expected however the bass levels help compensate to deliver good sound this is fantastic for the back patio and beach battery life span ha snot been fully tested but in uses has thus far drained my cell phone faster than the speaker the port in back can help charge as well
positive,got two of these with colors that matched out tablets easy to transport and just right feel in my hand so far they work perfectly and at what would consider great price 
positive,ok like to recommend that you really think about buying mouse that requires charging via usb cable because when this puppy goes dead you can work until you charge it work from home so use my mouse from am until about pm nonstop have to charge every day otherwise dead in about two days tops so do like the mouse but unlike just popping in some new batteries and you re good to go you have to remember to charge it lol 
positive,the speaker is clear and has great sound quality iphone connectivity is big plus 
positive,great price lightweight charges fast lasts long time or plug in to use love the backlight quiet waterproof for accidental spills overall great keyboard better than one that paid as much for 
neutral,it seemed to work ok for couple of days and then started noticing that it wasn moving my cursor where wanted it to go sometimes have to move it real fast just to find the cursor no matter what did it took an extraordinary amount of time to get it to land in the right spot gave up and started using my old mouse again 
negative,bought one at first broke within couple of months thinking maybe it was my daughter bought another and broke again within couple of months the middle wheel on the mouse is defective and it the same problem from the first one bought
neutral,returned it
neutral,wish they would get louder noise cancellation not very good 
positive,as said before got this for my mom for her birthday because she always uses my grey charge and loves it 
positive,prompt delivery on an awesome product
positive,great wireless mouse use it on my new hp stream laptop it does great it light weight and easy to use the lights on it are cool too 
negative,there is no lighting up of the headset unless very short cord is in the usb same time as the other that is plugged into the gaming unit that falsely advertised it sounds good and works good but no lights at all that mainly why picked this one bummer 
neutral,cheap charge barely last long and charging stopped working after couple of months don buy 
neutral,stopped working very conveniently after return window had closed 
neutral,bought this over the summer and it was awesome until it stopped working week ago not charging not turning on no connectivity nada nothing has helped get it working again and sickened to be throwing away almost on this piece of junk 
positive,positive quality great color
positive,so if you re looking for top of the line gaming headphones these aren it but they look really cool and sound pretty good you can beat the price 
neutral,very comfortable and doesn irritate the ears with long gaming sessions
positive,i was super excited to use this mouse for my macbook but it won even charge would return but do not have the packaging anymore do not buy 
neutral,absolutely loved this mouse but it stopped working all of the sudden after reading reviews it seems several others had the same issue but guess that what you get when you purchase something that is only

neutral,easy to use
negative,absolutely terrible the adapter doesn stay in the computer the mouse doesn charge not single good thing about it
neutral,this mouse worked one time and hasn worked since have tried charging it and flipping it to different settings it lights up and that is all that it does 
positive,it was present but feedback is that the sound is excellent
positive,the one currently using has been dropped number of times is currently wrapped with scotch tape wanted new one in the event the older one gives up quits on me and with this newer sleeker one it has splace for the usb connector to be stored for travel purposes on the underside of the mouse another great feature think 
neutral,i love the sound of this speaker deeply but the connection range is weak as hell feet away you start to lose connection volume wise between and it the same sound it doesn get louder love how it looks lot love the sound but the quality of the sound isn there for me little disappointed but it solid speaker all around 
positive,perfect for listening to tunes while doing dishes or hanging out in the backyard 
neutral,this product doesn work as it should literally have to hold the type port into my macbook for it to stay on 
neutral,the mouse is cool design with it lighting up as you move the mouse around my only grip with it is the mouse scroll wheel is not functional ve only had it for months and the scroll wheel stop working thought that with charging the unit it would fix the problem but to no eval unfortunately would not purchase this again 
neutral,excelente
positive,i absolutely love this mouse first off have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works that is huge with me next it very nice mouse love the colors it lights up with its so nice to not have to worry about battery too just plug in and charge and ready to go swear charge it like once month too and it still works great highly recommend this mouse 
positive,i actually love this speaker it easy to clean off the sand if you take it to the beach lake you can listen to it for hours just have had it on for over hours now as listening through the night charges fast the sound is amazing perfect to set the mood or party it out 
positive,connectivity keeps skipping out have even had other people try to link up and the same thing keeps happening sound is sub par at best
neutral,was very hard to click not worth 
positive,the mouse is cute has quiet clicks smooth glide and is light it is also comfortable for your hand like the rechargeable feature as well
positive,i love this works great and love the lights 
neutral,this mouse worked well for while months but now it is very unreliable switched usb ports got an extender thinking the connector was blocked by my metal desk that helped some but it lags and the click only works about half the time have classroom full of first graders who are waiting on my silly mouse to get it together so can show them the next slide or open the video for them it has been super frustrating will be purchasing another brand 
negative,plugged in and you can only hear if the cord is twisted while you hold it very disappointed and will be returning 
neutral,great if you re looking for cheap headset the sound quality and audio is poor however 
positive,pos won hold charge after months of light use can return
neutral,it did not light up ass it shown on the puture
positive,this mouse was perfect for my girl gamer it everything she was looking for style wise and worked perfectly 
positive,great product for the price my son loves it no complaints 
positive,i recently bought new chromebook and wanted wireless mouse to match came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it try cant say how good it works yet because never recieved the usb adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well otherwise its slim which is what wanted and like the lights on it
neutral,these served me well for few years have large ears so had to seek out another pair but if you have small to medium ears these will do you right 
positive,the speaker is very awesome with great quality sound it is bright red so it does not get misplaced any where in the office the portability of the speaker is pretty amazing too 
neutral,leave it for few minutes and come back it has to be turned off and back on needs frequent recharging 
neutral,unfortunately the scroll function is already broken otherwise this is very cute and comfy mouse love the lights 
neutral,what you can expect for the price point the audio quality itself is good but the mic is very quiet also the led only works with the usb plugged in which is downside 
positive,i love this mouse love the led colored lights the most another one of my favorite is that it is magnetic and sticks to my laptop when in the car or at the local coffee shop 
neutral,really liked how light weight the product is however it stopped working after months the battery life was great in the beginning but now it doesn operate even after charging it 
positive,i love this this thing take it with me where ever go and it can charge my phone recommend 
neutral,wasn terrible but prefer gaming mice with at least the two buttons on the side
positive,great value for money for an average user like me think this is great value the bose sound link has the degree sound but its about bucks more im willing to sacrifice that for the price plus this is waterproof and can be taken to the beach pool and shower
neutral,stopped working in about an hour 
neutral,i purchased these to use with my ps and the sound is fine and all but it has too many wires attached to it you have wire with the aux jack that connects to your controller and then you have usb wire that you need to plug into the console if you want the headphones to light up the lights are purely cosmetic but it annoying to have an extra wire attached to the controller if it not being used 
neutral,i do like the mouse but the usb connector does not go all the way in to my macbook which is frustrating 
positive,this is powerful little speaker it easily connects to so many of our devices the battery life is long and the sound is great very happy with this purchase 
positive,i bought of these for my kids the one thing that attracted me most was the led lights once we noticed how it works and how short the cord is was disappointed keeping it because they still like it but now have to look for usb extension to see if that helps and could feel better about the product 
positive,great product definitely serves its purpose 
neutral,son is very pleased with these headphones used for schoolwork and gaming
neutral,i purchased one for my desktop and one for my laptop received them both on june the scrolling wheel on one stopped working on july and the scrolling wheel on the other one stopped working on july

positive,it honestly awful it won charge and ve tried four different chargers 
positive,my son loves these he uses them with his computer and playstation 
positive,sound is great loud and very deep bass tone wife loved it 
negative,this product is crap do not buy opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble lightweight and cheap feeling does not slide particularly well although sleek it isn the most ergonomic thing but worst of all after plugging in and turning on the mouse will work normally for around secs if you leave it idle for longer than that the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working tried on multiple devices to no avail do not buy in most cases id say you get what you pay for but here it feels like even less than that 
neutral,i haven had it long and it just stop working it not in sleep mode it also says that the port has used all it space for the usb 
positive,yo this keyboard is just simply awesome one of the coolest keyboards ever owned hands down love the feel of each button on the keyboard love the color scheme of the led lights can even see some of the led lights like mixing with each other which just find totally cool the fact that this keyboard is wireless is just plus for me it is for sure not too overly clicky like other keyboards had in the past this one is more subtle but as well excellent to the touch guarantee your satisfaction with this keyboard and without doubt recommend it to anyone wanting new keyboard that is wireless or that is purchasing for the first time 
neutral,goes through batteries like water
negative,the style was perfect however the mouse stopped working within the first week tried to charge it but it simply stopped working it was waste of money 
neutral,the power button has become unable to work it feels like the button has been pushed in and cannot turn on my jbl

neutral,mouse worked great was easy to connect and use but stopped working and had to throw it away after months of use stopped charging stopped working all together 
positive,great for gaming and sound quality is great comfortable and easy to wear 
positive,the backlight doesn stay on only works when you re actually typing which is strange but can definitely live with it good quality otherwise keys are well made and are painted so you can see them even when it not lit up has multiple lighting modes that really can figure out
neutral,purchased december quit working may will not hold charge and will not turn on 
neutral,it works well functionality wise for me but the lights don work it just stays red and the light is very blinky jittery
positive,this keyboard looked great in the amazon pix and had great reviews unfortunately never got around to actually trying it out until days after the return window closed hate this thing and will never use it for several reasons the actual keys don light up just the areas underneath them and it very dim it not bright at all and can distinguish any changes when use the brightness keys the static breathing doesn change at all when press the keys 
positive,i play lot of pc games and really enjoy the quiet clicking compared to my old very loud mouse
positive,worked great for about weeks and then the battery kept dying faster and faster now it cannot even hold charge so it now rests in the garbage can

positive,good quality sounds great 
neutral,pure junk
positive,work really well for normal use with gaming actually sound about as good as other headphones have with sound canceling turned off the mic is actually really good and clear long cord not very many complaints except maybe the ear pads might be tad but more comfortable but what you pay for them is really good price 
neutral,as ve just learned by searching questions after using it for few weeks the scroll wheel stops working also these are silly lights for grownup they remind me of those kids shoes that light up when they step green pink yellow lights are kid or gamer colors every time try to save buck regret it off to buy new one 
positive,like this new mouse it works well and installation was also very easy so far really satisfy its performance and quality 
neutral, wanted to update my review not only did this not last at all have received multiple emails from the distributor asking to remove my review promising an amazon gift card they gave multiple excuses of why the item doesn work clearly from all the recent reviews of this item they have not fixed any of it get almost daily emails from them asking to remove my review do not buy this item you will regret it was loving this mouse sleek design loved the rechargeable feature of it until one day came into work booted up my laptop and the mouse was no longer connecting to the computer tried to take out the usb of the computer and part of it was left stuck in the computer am now going to have to try to get the piece out of the usb port on my laptop and how about that my return window ended last week very frustrated and annoyed by this would not recommend this item

negative,i am sick with stage melonoma so just opened it it jiggles junk
neutral,to small for my comfort
positive,this mouse has low profile which fits my hand perfectly the point glides smoothly over the screen haven seen any difference in pointer speed between the three dpi settings but it doesn matter because it is fast enough can say enough good things about the fact that this mouse is rechargeable but have been using it daily for about week and it shows no sign of running down or needing recharging the kaleidoscope effect of changing colors is cool makes me want to turn out the lights and use the computer in darkened room would definitely recommend this mouse 
positive,i loved this mouse when first got it it moves nicely and the colors around the base is awesome could tell it was cheaply made but didn think more of it just went to use it now and the scroller in the middle is busted it rotates but it doesn do anything on my computer 
negative,after month and half of buying this wireless mouse the piece where you charge it is broken have been extremely careful with it and never dropped it loved it but poor quality don buy it 
positive,this is headset got my son for christmas and he is using it and would just like to say that it is good gaming head set 
positive, stars because like others experienced left ctrl shift does not register with all keys guessing they didn map all of those or something alternative use is left ctrl right shift if you don use this key combo often then this is fantastic product 
positive,really like the feel of them and they look amazing bt can glow with usb plug in unless sit directly in front of your game system

neutral,works greateasy hook up and looks goodsolid assemblygreat price
positive,got these for the kids chromebook best thing yet kids like the lights and they are easy for them to use 
positive,this is supposed to be an upgrade from charge but they decided to only put one primary driver in and it shows bass response is good but the music sound incomplete either stick with the charge or pony up little more for the extreme 
positive,i bought these for my daughter forher nintendo switch she loves them
positive,solid gaming headset for very good price over the ear provides good noise cancellation the plastic materials used in the headset feel little cheap but ve had my headset for the last few years and it still works well
neutral,my friends say they hear little static when speak but not much more than another mic around the same price it what expected decent sound 
positive,i really liked that it was easy to set up really disliked the instructions which left much to be desired once figured out the problem myself setup was easy and seamless really like the way it looks and the ease of operation it only been in use for one day so guess will keep hoping that it works as well over time 
neutral,i bought this for my year old son who lives across the country and we game together on the xbox he loves it all around but gave it star only because there low hum that comes thru from his end id buy again 
positive,i gotten mouse mouse pad combo at tj maxx but there was no usb to connect it to my laptop so ordered this online it was good price and shipped quickly and am so glad ordered it it way cooler than the other one bought and feels like it made better it lights up there an on off and sleep mode to preserve battery also works so seamlessly and smooth great product thanks 
positive,omg this is literally one of the best mouse ve used in quite while previously was using small hp mouse and it gave me hand cramps over time however since switching this mouse has revived my fingertips to give me better mobility as complete my college assignments or even surf the web 
positive,these headphones so far are great no complaints purchased for year old gamer in may so still fairly new
neutral,really like array of colors so purchased mouse for every day workflow not gaming the scroll wheel is bit squeaky that the only flaw not sure if will keep it or put in file 
positive,was having pool party and this speraker rolled in the pool and died right away sounds good boy is not watter proof only had it for like to weeks
positive,i like stuff loud bit of an audiophile but don like spending lot unless it worth it prefer cheap and effective and that is this used to use the official playstation wireless headphones that cost over and those were great but then they stopped charging and got these freed up the usb port that was being used by the wireless headphones because these headphones plug into the wireless controller so for lot less money it still wireless and they sound great 
neutral,would recommend 
positive,the mouse is so fast and good got the silver color and its so pretty especially at night easy set up
neutral,i got the headset because needed one for work meetings wanted to drown out the noise when in meeting it does that and keeps the folks in the meeting from hearing the background noise and get the extra focus not gaming but still works 
negative,i like that is quiet mouse however one side of the mouse stopped working was going to see if can get an exchange and missed it by days broken in less than month 
neutral,i press one key the backlight turns on and then can press another key until the backlight turns off 
neutral,after only owning this for less than year the microphone does not work this break my son heart as playing fortnite without mic is really devastating

positive,have used this speaker both indoors and outside great sound in both cases supper easy to connect to 
positive,nice sound love the bass not too loud but loud for its size
positive,love this mouse
neutral,my first impression of this mouse was that the design was not well thought out because ordered the mouse in white the inner workings of the lights can be seen through the top of the mouse every time you move it and you can turn off the red light because the white plastic is translucent however ignored this issue because it was purely an aesthetic problem and didn mess with the functionality of the mouse unfortunately week or so later the mouse wheel completely stopped working ve since then gotten new mouse for even cheaper and not only does it look better but it also feels better and holds up well don waste your money
neutral,had device months and it quit won turn on or off very disappointed way to much money for months of use 
neutral,good for kids if true gamer don waste your money volume is low even when turn them up to the max
neutral,product stopped working shortly after month wouldn click properly 
neutral,it good size weight and shape but it bothers me that you can turn the red light off when you move it if you have the rainbow light on the red light still goes on when you move it so you don really get the rainbow effect
neutral,it didn sync with my laptop 
positive,great sound love it
positive,great sound adequate volume 
neutral,two thumbs up
neutral,as ve just learned by searching questions after using it for few weeks the scroll wheel stops working also these are silly lights for grownup they remind me of those kids shoes that light up when they step green pink yellow lights are kid or gamer colors every time try to save buck regret it off to buy new one 
neutral,the mouse stopped working after days 
positive,just received it works great good sound blocks lot of background noise making gaming lot easier 
positive,for cheap rechargeable mouse this is great 
neutral,the key board looks amazing but some of the keys don work and delete to name few 
positive,i have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand this mouse is lower so don need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click it not cure but it great that it fits my hand much better and doesn put as much strain on my hand 
positive,great deal for the price and sounds amazing
neutral,worked for day then nothing won even turn on 
positive,i bought this keyboard for my son and he loves it it lights up when he is using it and the lights go off when he isn the keyboard is quiet and it isn too big really good buy 
positive,not sure what to say that others haven already really great product rarely do ever get chance to turn the volume up to full it too loud for conversation even in large room 
neutral,it is sleek don care that it hass to be charged every night my other mouse rarely has to be charged went back to that one so do not care for this mouse
positive,works good very comfortable when using it for work and gaming battery life is about hrs say that because it almost lasted full work week 
neutral,good
negative,after having this mouse for weeks it stopped working computer doesn recognize the usb and wont pair with it wirelessly this is the replacement for the original one that broke after being dropped short distance no way of contacting the seller very disappointed
positive,i got new macbook air and wanted wireless mouse to go with it found this one and liked the color changing lights so bought it and received it quicker than expected and am enjoying it it has rechargeable battery so no changing batteries which also like plugged it in and it worked immediately the only thing would change at this point is the connector the usb connector is standard but it has to be plugged into another connector to use it with the usb connector which is all the new macbook has and it sticks out an inch and half overall am pleased with the mouse and its lights and it works as expected 
positive,i really liked this mouse the design is sleek can use the little attachment for my mac to make it compatible and it maneuvered well however after only few weeks of use the top plastic portion that splits down the middle to accommodate left and right clicking just literally spit apart and now my mouse is not functional very disappointed in the quality and durability of this item however gave it stars for the awesome performance prior to it breaking 
neutral,liked it
neutral,love for the most part charges fast but runs out fast hard to see the pointer arrow have closed lots of things by accidentrn
neutral,needs charging more than the average wireless mouse 
positive,its great headset an very good for gaming love it
positive,this mouse has the quietest click of any mouse ve ever owned and it puts itself to sleep if don move it for while it magical wasn sure about the color changing light but it not overpowering or distracting ve had very long line of previous wireless mice but think this is my favorite very pleased with this purchase 
positive,this was great purchase he says they are everything he hoped for score 
positive,perfect fit for my small laptop and its case and it works great 
positive,they are good excellent product highly recommend good sound my kids use them all the time 
positive,very easy to use and sleek design it is small enough to fit easily into my computer bag when have to take it with me 
neutral,i wish the charger was longer it so short used it once and the mouse was not calibrated had to bang it couple of times then it worked buying new one do not recommend this product 
positive,great looks with surround sound
neutral,i have purchased two of this product in the past year one to replace the other on both of the the scroll button stopped working dropped the first one and understood why it stopped working the second one did not drop it just quit working after months cute and light weight but not long lasting enough for me 
positive,works great
neutral,it just stopped working out of nowhere mad missed my return date 
neutral,if would give zero would the keys are cheap and the lettering has worn after only couple of months 
positive,i bought this at the end of august and it worked great until now now it won hold charge and can return it because it has been over the time very disappointed 
positive,very easy to use really like the lighted keyboard the price is great and it is very well made 
positive,we love the color and design great product for gaming 
positive,love it 
neutral,i am very disappointed with the quality of life this mouse has bought it and was only able to use it four or five times and it has been problem for me ever since ve charged it adequately and it won start not sure if its factory malfunction or not but it should still be working ve owned it for little over month now 
neutral,type connector was bent unable to use is there way to get replacement type connector 
negative,scrolling wheel went lose broke less than week after purchase 
positive,i gave it four star rating only because we realized that to use it for the xbox one you can have the lights on at the same time for talking because the plugs for the lights has to be plugged into the xbox it self but to talk the plug has to be plugged into the controller and the cords split off of each other so it not long enough other than that it works great and my son loves it
neutral,i like the slim design and color 
neutral,bought it for my year old lil bro for his xbox one he seems to like it
neutral,sound quality is great and so is the waterproofness but have two jbl xtremes and they cannot connect via jbl connect with the charge apparently the xtreme is connect and the charge is connect 
positive,i recently picked up new computer and needed new mouse one that would fit the bill for my work editing video it needed to be light ergonomic and move well with sensitivity also work in low light and the led light on the mouse is nice touch the led is certainly not an essential feature but it definitely adds nice look to the product and for me is very appealing this mouse has been great all around recommend this product edit initially loved this mouse however its ability to maintain charge dramatically decreased in short order it can no longer keep charge for more than an hour or so the mouse has essentially become useless this is quite disappointment after initially enjoying the other qualities of this mouse 
positive,i love it iv had it for two years and it great lowkey spilled coffee on it yesterday and the light and everything still works ve spilled multiple things on it and it still good so it is granted waterproof also bought this cover for it to travel with and it fits 
neutral,i just brought this mouse for my laptop game cheaper and function enough for me good buy 
positive,can think of anything that don like about this unit sound is very good for it size easy to pack around too 
positive,bass is good the cord is long comfortable for most people and its pretty solid for gaming it pretty awesome especially for about twenty bucks worth try 
positive,fantastic sound and perfect portable sizzle 
positive,the mic is really good teammates can hear me perfectly and video game noises are really good quality for the price the noise cancellation is unbelievable
positive,works great with my macbook pro perfect for regular use 
positive,pros great battery life charged once and it lasted the week working hours day backlight turns off quickly with no keystrokes to preserve battery easy to connect cons the space bar button squeaks when pressed 
positive,when turned it on and the back lights appeared in beautiful rainbow pattern was blown away it is such nice keyboard am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt what love best about the product is everything really the keys are soft and comfortable with the exception of the space key love how quiet these keys are can type discreetly without being too loud love that the lighting is adjustable both in pattern and brightness the breathing mode is very neat feature and like that can adjust the speed of it it has calming effect but also like that can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if don want them on the wireless feature is neat because can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don have to worry about plugging it in like the little legs on the bottom so can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat if want it to be more or less ergonomic the battery display is great feature because can tell when need to plug it in before it loses power also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use on the instructions pamphlet at the very end it says thinks for reading it should say thanks for reading it obvious that great care was taken to create high quality product so it disappointing to see such careless error one other thing don care for is how loud the space bar is all the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make sound but when tap the space bar it makes loud plastic sound that seems to resonate throughout the room for how often it gets used was hoping it would be bit quieter other than those two things wouldn change anything this product is very easy to use the instructions were incredibly helpful and well written it nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages it gives the impression that this is worldwide company and because of that very successful it gives the company lot of credibility the instructions were easy to read and follow like that the function keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard absolutely love this keyboard and would recommend it to all of my friends whether you have laptop or desktop computer this keyboard is not only great to look at it works very well there is an incredible value for the money here have several klim products in my office and love each one am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again 
positive,i had never heard of this brand and was little concerned might be buying some weird off brand that was of poor quality so glad that not the case this keyboard is all quality they keys feel amazing to type on the lighting comes with few options like adjusting brightness and the whole thing feels sturdy set up was easy of course was reading through the few inserts that come in the packaging and there even cute description of how the keyboard was shipped to me 
neutral,worked great for few days but then it quit working it wouldn charge and if got the light to actually come on the cursor wouldn move 
neutral,the sound is phenomenal if you pair with another you practically have stereothis is just as good as the bose speaker bluetooth speaker these can stand toe to toe with them 
positive,my family loves this brand
positive,doesn work and won charge cheap 
neutral,the keys themselves are fairly quiet but the space bar appears to only be anchored in one spot so it clicks when you press it calling this keyboard silent is false advertising also have had the problem with using the left ctrl shift keys in keystroke sequence like when clearing cache or opening an incognito window which regularly need to do for work the right ctrl shift keystroke works though do like the battery life and the backlight but will be returning this and looking for something different 
positive,i really liked this mouse when first got it it was low profile had nice soft and quiet click had rainbow lights and was available in rose gold color thought made great purchase now ve had it for less than months and the scroll wheel is so squeaky can stand to hear it when scrolling through documents bummed it was lemon 
positive,best purchase made on amazon highly recommended 
neutral,will not hook up to my laptop
positive,really great for the mouse really light and wow just passed my expectations would buy again 
positive,my son loves his video games and with this headset he can play with his friends this is the second one he got and he wanted the same one because it is so comfortable it is really comfortable on the ears the voices are clear and he loves it we would highly recommend it 
neutral,we purchased these for gaming and they work just fine my son has not complained that they are uncomfortable and wears them for long stretches of time would buy again 
positive,mic works great on this set and sound is good for the price
positive,i love the product excellent for my year old son 
positive,replaced an old jbl speaker which only lasted hours the battery and sound quality of this jbl charge speaker is outstanding and highly recommend it battery lasts for hours 
positive,i liked everything about this mouse was working great the couple of times week that used it then one day the scroll wheel stopped working completely no it not dirty there is no resistance it feels like it is free wheeling in there no explanation past return period 
negative,this headset is so bad when plug it in it doesn work at all sometime it works for sec then shuts down
positive,very comfortable like the noise cancelling feature 
positive,i use laptop everyday at work and this was life saver very comfortable reliable wireless mouse 
neutral,mouse doesn slide easily sticks and on both my desk surface and my mouse pad you have to click very hard to make selection and the scroll bar is not consistent in speed wouldn purchase this product 
neutral,a flimsy mouse that broke down within two months of very light use would recommend spending bit more money and buy branded mouse and have peace of mind 
neutral,nice headphones
positive,great sound very portable looks great and sounds great 
neutral,don get me wrong it an excellent headset however it just uncomfortable maybe it just me but the actual headphone piece is just little bit too small 
positive,i admit was going to return this item because did not understand the little usb attachment was on the bottom of the device had charged it but was using the little black usb insert in my laptop which did not work once inserted the white short usb from underneath the pointer my computer accepted it and it works great am still learning how to use these devices at age it is gorgeous and works 
negative,this product is crap do not buy opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble lightweight and cheap feeling does not slide particularly well although sleek it isn the most ergonomic thing but worst of all after plugging in and turning on the mouse will work normally for around secs if you leave it idle for longer than that the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working tried on multiple devices to no avail do not buy in most cases id say you get what you pay for but here it feels like even less than that 
positive,i like that now when you answer the phone it automatically takes your call off speaker to allow for private conversation on the older models it would blast right through the speakers and you have to scramble for head phones or run to turn off the jbl speaker thank god don have to do that anymore however do wish that it was optional for only the music to continue softly in the background separate from phone conversations wouldn mind having few more of these around the house since think they link together love the speakers great sound very convenient for wherever and whenever 
neutral,it is not sound the way expectedand it came whitout the charger
positive,i love the feel and look of it
positive,great keyboard good value and keys don make much sound lost the receiver for it few weeks ago and thought now had useless paperweight instead of keyboard reached out to klim customer support expecting less than nothing and was surprised that they were going to send me new receiver from their facility in france at no charge it took just over week and had my keyboard back up and running just had to do quick and super easy pairing procedure thanks to klim customer service and one service agent in particular who probably can name here it not often you have hassle free efficient and genuine customer service anymore well done 
positive,works fantastic
negative,the charging cord is so short and flimsy it won stay connected to both pieces so it is difficult to get full charge the mouse does not hold charge after be left on the charger overnight it is dead within five minutes use 
neutral,back yard parties are enhanced with the music from this speaker 
positive,i got this product days ago and everything was working great until wanted to use my mouse for different computer only to find out that the casing for drive was stuck in my computer and has no rendered both that usb port and my mouse useless the mouse is great in use but now cant use the mouse or the port until can find strong enough tweezers to get the piece out 
positive,husband loves them he loves how it cancels our noise which means he can hear me or the dog while he wearing them 
positive,keep in mind this is my first bengoo headset so assume it rare case however this was not great first impression was using it on my pc but it probably works best as console headset the headset itself looks great the speaker sounds nice and love the design for not only the aesthetic but the mic buttons on the cable as well unfortunately that all positive comments can give the setup app did not connect to the headset no matter if enabled it on windows defender or restarted the computer for it to reset not only that it takes attempts to open the app needed to end the background task of the first attempt to open it then it didn even recognize the headset at all no options to configure or anything trying to use another app for the setup was annoying and had me constantly checking the ports when finally got connected to the mic was greeted with the sound of rain like static that was louder than my own voice volume the volume of the mic itself was so low needed to increase it to the maximum value it also has default super bass feel to it that makes your voice more muffled than recognizable was hoping to replace my pc gaming headset but can say feel confident buying this one 
neutral,came with big gash in it 
positive,i got this in the mint green color and like that color the only issue is that it broke in about month so if you really need mouse for your laptop but if you want cheap one then don really recommend this product 
neutral,more technical trash
positive,rechargeable beautiful features long lasting hours for use on off switch 
positive,i bought this for my laptop for school work and it exceeded my expectations the colors are amazing and not too distracting so easy to connect and use it also silent love it 
positive,loved it 
neutral,purchased of them not very loud at full volume my old marley is louder 
negative,cheap plastic feel right out the box the audio would cut out just from moving the wire even the most basic movement caused it to short out horrible sound quality when it did work even at the highest level it was barely audible got the headset because of the high ratings but looking at the lower scores it would seem that my issue isn an isolated occurrence 
neutral,good for the price it also doesn make the typical mouse clicking sound you can barely hear it 
positive,perfect sound and quality for my little market 
positive,it feels cheap compared to my corsair it is just average sorry but am spoiled the only thing it has going for it is that it is wireless which is why will keep and use it the keyboard seems to be smaller am touch typist and my fingers feel cramped think it impedes my typing speed pretty good at above wpm don use it for gaming write voraciously and need keyboard that has quick response this one is ummmmm just okay 
neutral,i wish the charger was longer it so short used it once and the mouse was not calibrated had to bang it couple of times then it worked buying new one do not recommend this product 
positive,great looking speaker and the mono sound is clear and loud if you re looking for stereo don bother with the charge unable to get my two speakers to play in stereo mono party mode only contacted jbl support who said sorry but the charge is unable to play in stereo at this time our engineers are working on it and yet they are still advertising as the ability to pair two speakers to stereo with no timeline from the engineering department as to when looking for stereo speakers don buy these 
positive,for the price you really can beat this deal the sound is great and they are comfortable 
positive,really cool wireless mouse especially love the perfect ergonomic size and design and the cool lights 
neutral,haven tried it yet but looks accurate
positive,i like how compact it is and it has good bass
neutral,the mouse stopped working after about month of use 
positive,i love the water resistance long battery high volume and bass for such small speaker also the ability to charge my phone off of it is great just wish it was tad bit smaller and dedicated forward back buttons but otherwise exceptional 
positive,very nice bluetooth speaker with fantastic battery life the sound is clear though would appreciate bit more bass to balance the sound overall very good high quality speaker 
negative,i bought two speakers when connected them they were disconnecting oh they were making noises contacted the seller and he told me to do an update to the system did it and it was the same bought another two in case they were defective and it was the same problem had to return all and my money was returned to me in two weeks it was not good experience
negative,decent little wireless mouse priced good for children who tend to lose and destroy things biggest issue is the charging cable that comes with it is garbage can be charged using phone charger all in all decent purchase and would buy again 
positive,stepson loved it
neutral,it worked well for couple of weeks but now there is significant lag between where move the mouse and where it actually goes do not waste your money 
positive,great speaker sounds amazing my only gripe is the volume every time go up or down there is pretty big difference 
positive,work well and are good at noise cancelling also like the light up effect 
positive,unfortunately am lucky to get hours out of the speaker was sure wouldn get the full rated hours but really figured would get more than otherwise great speaker 
neutral,charged the mouse over use it for min it completely drain out and it too late to return since bought it months ago what wast 
positive,i use it for my iphone toshiba tv my projector so can have movie night outside but haven hooked it up yet to my projector so far it worked great with my tv and iphone 
positive,we use it for rosetta stone it works really well it is comfortable it looks cool we like it 
neutral,this mouse will not stay connected to my computer
positive,i got this for my daughter for school it is perfect and appeals to her teenage likes
positive,perfect for boating and camping
negative,this mouse came broken very upset it was delivered in time but the devise itself was broken the package was opened it wasn even inside the actual box it ridiculous definitely going to get my money back gave it star because had no choice but too 
positive,great service fast delivery got this for my new laptop like it didnt know that it chages colors thought that was pretty cool when you turn mouse over on the bottom theres spot where it turns on or off and picture of sun and that changes the color of the mouse that is nice just got this the other day to match my laptop as its pink rose color and love it it slim and doesnot hurt my fingers when scrollig which like
positive,i like this mouse because of the leds and the color but the usb converter that it comes with is not reliable had to use different one in order for the mouse to be usable have also noticed sometimes lag in clicks so wouldn suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise
neutral,the cable has fault near the volume control this leads to one side not working didn expect much from cheap set of headphones but come on 
neutral,the first few weeks it worked great then all of sudden the scroll stopped working and it just spins have to physically grab the side of the page to move down really disappointed 
positive,really good speaker battery life is pretty good as well super easy to connect via bluetooth and also to connect to other charge speakers
positive,my laptop has terrible sound quality and produces sound super low both from the speakers and other headphones but these amp the sound up so that can actually hear without straining my ears and they also help with noise cancellation as my roommate can get loud at night for certain reasons if you know you know but if put these on won hear thing they don stay on too well if you move your head around ton normal movement is fine but abrupt jerky movements make them slide bit still would definitely recommend them 
positive,i really like this mouse love that it doesn need batteries you just charge it and it ready to go did have issue with my macbook pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad and wasn able to scroll without using the mouse had to call apple to figure out how to fix it and that when discovered removing the usb adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem have usb to usb adapter from the mac store so just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly and it doesn change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all 
positive,didn like not receiving charger cord which happens to be different from charge which have two of the charge have also no pamphlet or other paperwork seems like might not be new speaker itself works fine so far 
neutral,mouse takes long time to connect and spend way to long to try to make it work it got here fast though
neutral,was good while it worked used for basic office work nothing heavy scroll button broke despite almost never using that function 
positive,this came with an adaptor to fit the apple laptop but is not made specifically for apple products the charge does not last long and needs special adaptor prefer battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome the three settings for on off are also less than ideal in summary while this mouse is aesthetically pretty it is not functional with the apple products 
neutral,small lightweight yet firm solid feel led lighting is nice touch shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown however the main reason purchased was because of the silent feature sadly it not as silent as had hoped clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing why cant someone make truly silent mouse have yet to find one as most silent mice are merely muffled by rubber lining shame would be perfect otherwise
negative,i have had many headsets and the sound from this headset is terrible nothing like what they have posted or advertised highly do not recommend these for gaming
positive,battery life is great was on all day full hrs came back next day played again all day then plug it in over night didn want it to go down during the day so that super compared to my bose speaker barely ran hrs volume levels are huge vary lowed on high setting and again much better then my bose speaker will be coming back for another one of these they connect to each other for multi room function also the blue tooth connectivity is great can go any were in the house with my phone and it does not loose connection or get broken up and again this is better speaker than my bose hands down out of my last several speakers this one is the best 
positive,this is an awesome little mouse connection was super easy it quiet as mouse and compared to my last mouse silent the buttons work great it feels really smooth and think the size is perfect for me 
neutral,the wheel button broke as it was simply built with thin plastic rod sent it back hard pass 
neutral,never worked had to return it wouldn connect after charging x
positive,this worked great for the first months and then it didn work at all didn use it daily sent an email to the one provided and never got response 
positive,decent low cost headphones for gaming cool led but much rather put money into better audio quality 
neutral,works great for casual gaming comfortable for long periods of time run into issues sometimes where if lot of effects go on in game headset has hard time following but that rarely happens best headset for the price tbh
positive,really like the feel of the mouse in my hand have dropped it numerous times and it keeps working like charm so far am really pleased with it
positive,this mouse us nit very comfortable keep hitting the button and bringing up pages don want the cursor jumps sound the page without my moving the mouse charge doesn last long it fun to watch all of the flashing colors 
negative,worked until it needed to be charged after charging it worked sporadically and needed to be charged everyday need to be able to use my mouse everyday not wait for it to be charged 
positive,i bought this mouse in april liked it lot for months for the last few weeks it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about half hour even if try to use it plugged into the computer it stops tracking and the lights dim can find any warranty information on it feel like it should have lasted more than months think ll buy wireless mouse with known brand name and hope for better luck 
positive,this speaker is outstanding sound is great very well built am gonna buy another one for sure highly recommend this product 
positive,i ve had the flip for years just started going out so hope the longevity is the same for this one obviously the sound quality between flip and charge is way different but instantly impressed love that now able to charge in the truck now definitely makes some great sound in about sq ft we use these as kitchen speaker while we cook it amazing have had this for about hrs if any severe inconveniences come along will update this jbl has been long favorite of mine btw an audiophile and have installed at least car audio systems 
positive,this wireless keyboard is really practice and affordable just got it and tested working well bottoms feel strong and clicking is soft is not noisy and has drain holes on the back is case of water splashed if you looking for quality and value totally recommended 
neutral,didn work very well from the very beginning then it was dropped in water dried out and was even worse 
positive,i like that this mouse has rechargeable feature which makes it super lightweight and slim that makes super easy to carry color options are nice as well would definitely recommend this one 
positive,my son uses for gaming and loves them
positive,great headphones got this headset for my new remote work at home position on the phone with clients for many hours at time ear buds were hurting my ears and trying to talk through the computer speaker was making it hard to hear clients and vice versa this head set wore for hours straight and never got headache and my ears didn hurt clients voices were clear there also volume control wheel on the cord of the headset itself which has been extremely useful for switching between quiet caller and then loud caller 
positive,absolutely love everything about this speaker great sound and connects well it even says waterproof well we accidentally dropped it on our hot tub and it still works amazing so give it stars for very good speaker
positive,nice looking light weight keyboard happy with the purchase 
positive,really nice rat would definitely recommend it feels great rechargeable cool led colors and wireless

positive,for the price this headset is good quality product it sounds great when in simulation games the foam ear pads are great when playing for few hours well made with volume control in the cord that plugs into the pc 
positive,i really like this mouse it is light and re action is immediate also like its usb input great product 
positive,with virtual learning forced upon us we were lucky to have this amazing headset 
neutral,the tracking ball wheel stopped working after couple of months thinking broke the tracking wheel ordered new one and it arrived with the same issue straight out of the box it works fine if you don mind not having the tracking wheel 
positive,for sure it nothing for professional gaming and music but for that value it really good you can do anything wrong with if you don have high expectations and look for an spare device my daughter is happy with good quality for good price
neutral,i liked this mouse until it broke two days outside of the return window the roller for the scroll function broke while was scrolling was nothing but gentle with this mouse and it only lasted days it is nice looking the colored lights are not obnoxious and it is very quiet 
neutral,was working fine then surly the clicker in the middle stoped working
neutral,you get what you pay for noted have to click this mouse at least three times to get it to do what want on any button on it it is so frustrating and find myself wishing would have spent more for quality product which may now have to do anyway bc im just so unhappy with it it is so cheaply made plastic all around wonder how this can justify price of over jmo others seem to like it it just was not what am looking for used it as replacement to my imac mouse circa which finally died miss the magic mouse but not worth lol im going to have to find happy medium this mouse doesn get it at all only redeeming factor is it is rechargeable 
neutral,they are good for kids
positive,it is my son gift my son love it very much 
neutral,like everything about it
positive,soft and comfortable
positive,this mouse works excellent it easy to move very lightweight love the way it lights up excellent buy 
positive,the headset is comfortable and good sound quality 
negative,it worked for the first hour bought it went to charge it it no longer works turns on or charges 
neutral,just didn work for me could not plug into my chromebook 
positive,i thought this mouse was very cute love the led feature and used it to play games with friends val league genshin etc and it is passable for someone who plays casually like me but probably not for someone picky about equipment however today it spent some time in the side pocket of my backpack and no longer seems to work turn it on and the light flashes and goes off again and there is no way to take it apart or try to fix it if you transport your laptop pc lot would hesitate to get this mouse but otherwise was fan 
neutral,ordered for my son they didn last but week or so one side stopped working after about week 
negative,one hell of speaker
positive,excellent sound noise cancellation my year old loves them 
negative,this is good looking keyboard it is wireless with short usb charging cable it can barely reach from my desktop to the usb port in the front of my computer also wfh like many of us right now tax accountant and have to have accuracy in everything type this keyboard has lag doesn matter whether its on or off the charger type wpm and it cannot keep up due to the lag it also misses many digits from the key keypad due to this lag had an unnoticed typo in zip code for an irs form my new boss was not happy missed this which of course shouldn have except for the lag and almost lost my new job when the keyboard is not being charged it will start to freeze and lag and generally miss numbers and letters then realize need to put it on the charger so plug it in and its working ok then next thing know an hour or so later it starts doing the same thing again so need to take it off the charger then another hour or so it does it again now need to put it on the charger terrible ve never had such problem with charger before ever wanted to return the product as it was not cheap but looks like have no option for return purchased on and with the hullabaloo of starting new job hadn realized was slipping out of the exchange and return window don waste your 
neutral,lasted little over month and the scroll wheel stopped working 
neutral,wish it was bigger using it out by the horseshoe pit and in my room at night it sounds great but it not enough sound to rock the block battery life is shorter then what they say but probably lasts long enough to get thru whatever your doing 
positive,the quality seems little cheap because it plactic but the quality and all the features are on point they are really comfortable and make it fun to play with
positive,the main we reason we bought the jbl to begin with was because it has the jack that you could use for an ipod know old school my husband had spent years downloading all of his favorite songs on his ipod and wanted to be able to listen to his playlist through quality speaker once we received the speaker we were super impressed with the sound quality the bluetooth range is good too we liked the quality so much that we have three of them we keep one at home for pool parties and get togethers and we have two at our cabin 
neutral,quality sound lighting and comfy to use
neutral,stopped working after months
neutral,mic threshold is awful
neutral,good
positive,jbl is great
neutral,i purchased this mouse and received it on september th charged it and started to use it it worked fine up until today now the left clicker does not work which is the side used for everything it has been less than two months and am unable to use the mouse for work waste of money
neutral,it came on time looks nice and is very light weight
negative,worst wireless mouse have ever purchased the lag time to respond to movement is horrble clicking is even worse sometimes have to click three or four times before the mouse works tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop do not purchase complete waste of money and time 
positive,it was very good got it for my nephew for his birthday and he loves it 
positive,this headset has very good sound quality fits nicely on head and comfortable the mic pickup isn too sensitive and of course it looks cool how it lights up 
positive,i bought it for work it so smooth color is matte black led lights are so cool and fun doesn make any clicking sound is rechargeable very happy with this purchase 
positive,really like the quietness of the clicks flatter than most mice took little bit of getting used to but fine now will be easy to travel with very responsive charges by usb and lasts for several days no need to have extra batteries led lights are fun but hard to see in bright light looking at the screen when using the mouse who doesn so don really see the lights that much 
positive,i was used to buying name brand mouses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger mouses have 
positive,this mouse is prettt okay it works fine and lights up pretty which is bonus not fan of the feeling of clicking though wish bought different mouse for that reason but will hold onto it for now 
negative,i am very disappointed in this mouse while using it the mouse will constantly stop working and will have to turn it off and on just to get it to work again this happens at least times day as well the battery life is not long at all if do not charge it every night it will not work in the morning avoid

positive,got this for my kid to play games with been over months and it is still working great can beat it for the price 
positive,super speaker sound is great easy blue tooth setup great value

neutral,wish you could have the option to not have the led color lights on all of the time or way to just pick one and not have the constant circulation looks bad during the day
neutral,very good 
positive,good headset works as expected confortable support wish the usb part was longer so it could go into my ps other then that works great
positive,this wireless mouse is good size with great compatibility with my mac it great price and color matches my cover highly recommend for those that just need an everyday mouse 
negative,we bought this as replacement for our son for school work he had the old version and it worked really well but he dropped it one to many times and broke lasted yr this one couple weeks into school work the cursor started to drift for no reason my son is in the th grade no drops tried several differ backgrounds nothing worked so my husband tried out the mouse still does not work not upgraded waisted our money and frustrated the whole house withe the uncontrollable drift 
positive,great for gaming good sound only negative sometimes wont come off mute without unplugging 
negative,i just received this product today and even though there were numerous good reviews unfortunately cannot leave positive one due to the fact that this is useless due to non functional otg plug 
positive,great item overall but wish it uses usb to charge then micro usb 
positive,bought thus for my daughter with new gaming computer she loves it and the colors match her headphones
neutral,the mouse feels great in your hand is delightfully colorful but doesn scroll down the page was only able to click down which is bothersome on web pages would return it but threw out the box if you don get defective one its good buy for the price

positive,slick beautiful mouse for all apps love that led display on the mouse
positive,this headset is incredible for being mic quality is clear readings with minimal background noise sound quality being an clear audio levels though played apex legends and at times couldn hear audio with setup very simple and easy though it does have additional jacks for optimal audio 
positive,i was looking for simple inexpensive wireless mouse to use on server that only have to access occasionally this fit the bill perfectly drivers installed automatically from windows and off to the races great price for simple solution 
neutral,did not work and can return now don buy 
positive,it been few months and still works well very nice purchase thank you 
neutral,bought this one thinking it was the bigger one before the boombox turned out to be the next one after the flip had flip before this charge sounds just like it it basically flip with extra battery life if your looking for bigger sound go with the extreme or boombox 
neutral,overall this keyboard is good connects fine lighting is pretty cool keys are comfortable very very light and doesn take up too much space on the desk however it doesn remain charged at all even after left plugged in overnight the keyboard dies after being unplugged it still works okay but the battery life is extremely disappointing 
positive,my old headset was going out so had to buy new one saw this in the amazon choice on sale for over half off and the reviews were good so bought it came in day sooner than expected they have great sound came in at full volume and had to lower the volume since it was so loud don use the mic because have standalone mic so can say how that works my only complaint is the ear cushions aren as comfortable as hoped they re kind of stiff 
negative,i got this head set and the mic doesn work it barely comes to your mouth the sound isn too loud and the headset feels so cheap like cheap plastic can stress this enough do not get this headset worst product have ever bought on amazon 
positive,it moves well and like that can turn it off if not using it 
positive,lights are visible through white part because white part is thin but it nice

positive,functional and affordable they fit my son head nicely braided cable with volume and mute switch haven tested lights because he just needed something for school he says they re comfy and awesome 
positive,love this thing sounds great good bass for small unit very satisfied 
positive,works great only cons what that had handle or space for hands to go when carrying wish they had more bass and bluetooth connection to connected speakers goes in and out with that being said stars
positive,this product is cheap and does not last long after only one day of use plug it into the outlet and it does not turn on needed gaming mouse and this one is definitely not it extremely upset
positive,gaming for fun
positive,set up couldn be easier put the white usb thing into my computer and the mouse magically worked that all it took got the gold rose and it very pretty 
positive,super sad because was obsessed with this mouse but it has already stopped working after one month super frustrating should had just gone to best buy originally 
positive,great keyboard lights up and works fine 
negative,charge didn last all day and then delay kept getting longer simply don have time to hook it to cord and there no battery charge option 
positive,sound quality is amazing and definitely is good for talking trash on online games haha
negative,one ear doesn even work waste of money was excited because my previous headphones broke but was extremely disappointed when the audio to the one side didn even work plus they re extremely uncomfortable if you wear glasses 
neutral,i got white one and the leds shine thru the plastic the pointer tracking laser noticeably strobes will get something better made
positive,it pretty good and got on sale for good deal battery life is true hour use wish was little more bass but other than that happy with purchase pretty loud bought two love the fact that they can connect together 
positive,my son loves his new headphones
neutral,discounted fornthe urine complexion but this speaks gets it
positive,this was great mouse for it price loved the colorful lights too overall satisfied with this purchase 
positive,my husband has been wanting speaker like this for while this was deal of day so jumped on it he is so happy with this speaker thanks for great deal and extremely fast shipping 
positive,i got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he seems to love it 
neutral,the keyboard initially works well and after few minutes when you type one the text does not appear and write several things and do not mark the text it is fault that affects my work regarding the colors it has two lighting modes the first is so that it never turns off and without colors on the keyboard and the second is so that it turns on and off thought the lighting was color by color will write the provider to help me with the key problem and that will depend on my qualification
neutral,this was great buy but reason gave it stars is it doesn have very long range to operate in you can only go about feet before you lose connection 
positive,sound quality excellent easy to connect check the box carefully or you will miss the compartment that holdsthe charger like did have only had to charge it once after more than months no hunt for the right adapters
neutral,it is nice
positive,my son absolutely loves them and uses it with his ps no complaints with the audio and he seems to like the fit 
positive,i really like the slim size it fits into ravel bag nicely love that it can be turned off for travel and not have to remove the battery the colorful lights are nice touch 
positive,great quality and non expensive 
positive,i ve loved this mouse since bought the first one will continue to use it
positive,update had it charging for less than minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic in that time the cord got super hot and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well probably would have caught fire if left unattended update using different cords was just fine do not use the cord that comes with it update battery won hold charge was really wanting this mouse to work but looks like returning it after all 
positive,worked really well and enjoyed them for good two months until they just up and stopped working out of nowhere 
neutral,can go wrong with this
positive,works great
neutral,my kids like it
positive,i had solid green back lit keyboard that stopped working wanted another solid color but could not find one so bought this one that has multi color back light have to say like it better also the keys feel much more substantial and it has an on off switch that like as well works from decent distance also recommend 
positive,great
positive,bought them for hubby for gaming on the ps he loves them 
neutral,i really like this mouse for work use mine all day charge it on wednesday mid week and leave it charging friday over the weekend works completely fine coming back and buying two more had to come buy more because dropped mine and it cracked open that the only reason why not because it stopped working but because broke mine so this time in also getting backup my work laptop is mac and rather much buy this mouse than the expensive apple one 
positive,this mouse is very quiet just as advertised was shocked at the lack of clicking when you push the right or left side that was my main push to purchase besides the cool colors and led lights must say those are just an aestetic bonus but it kind of makes working fun this mouse is plastic so the gold tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic it charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse overall this mouse is really great am glad bought it and if you are sitting on the fence just go ahead and get it 
neutral,these headphones are very lightweight and sound quality was pretty decent for the price range would buy again 
positive,works well and the splitter is very helpful
neutral,was looking for speaker to blast out the neighbors who sit too close at the beach think found it in the jbl charge stay tuned 
positive,mouse is nice thought there was an option to not have it light up since don need that function but the options are off one color and alternating many colors it only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still glides good clicks well my only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be little unreliable if want to scroll down just line or two it won move and then if scroll just little faster it zooms down the page overall decent
positive,it is super comfy and love the lights around it small enough for my hands highly recommend this mouse 
neutral,i like everything about it
neutral,pretty but dies quick even with new batteries we returned it
positive,the sound was awesome 
neutral,or should say worked well it stopped working after like weeks 
positive,used for my grandson ps but audio doesn work his friends can hear him
positive,i liked the sleep mode price is reasonable also liked the shape 
neutral,haven had it year and have barely used it and it already stopped working right the mouse just goes all over the place on the screen and not where you try to put it 
neutral,keyboard works okay except the key continues to get stuck as soon as started using it and needs to be picked at to lift it back into place and messes up my work lot the space bar is much louder than the rest of the keys which is more of an annoyance than anything 
positive,very nice keyboard love how it lights up 
neutral,received as gift and wanted to love it but the hot keys issue is real the ctrl and shift keys on the left side cannot be used together as programmer can live without hot keys like this select text to end or beginning of documents uppercase or lowercase words etc many editors use these hot keys 
neutral,the second we plug the mic into the xbox controller the controller turns off when we take it out the controller turns back on tried it with all of our controllers bogus do not buy 
positive,bought as gift for my grandson to take to college he loves it 
positive,my son loves these we had purchased another pair and he said they were very uncomfortable he requested these and is very happy
positive,i loved the mouse and it worked great for the first couple of weeks and then the scroll wheel is no longer working 
positive,loved it love the colors 
positive,we needed wireless keyboard quickly and this keyboard from klim could not be better find the colors are fun and the keyboard has full keys that are quiet and responsive it takes up less space than our old model and so far it has been working really well make sure you take look at the booklet that comes with the keyboard it fun read about the company and the people who founded it 
neutral,when received this product the first time it had come broken the entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn easily be snapped back into place sent in for replacement and everything was all fine they sent replacement no problems this was in april flash forward to december mere eight months the mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now useless which makes playing games bit difficult as many games use the scroll wheel when to contact customer service all contact is closed use caution when ordering this mouse at first the replacement had been sent was good despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged but if the scroll wheel mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions perhaps pass for something more heavy duty 
neutral,the aux cable broke off inside the controller had to pick it out piece by piece normal use this should have remained intact with basic gaming 
positive,i researched amazon for wireless mouse and found this one bought it to use with new laptop it works great it is responsive easy to use and saves me time tinkering with the laptops built in mouse another plus is no more batteries to buy happy to have this 
positive,bought this for my teenage son to use for his ps gaming he has used sony gold headsets and turtle beach higher end sets and says these are an very good for the price they seem to be an excellent value this is being rated stars not that they are as good or better than the others mentioned but for the value vs quality of sound hopefully they will last decent while to truly earn the star rating gave it stars but if they don last for at least months that will be revised 
positive,looks like great quality gaming headphones and will be an awesome addition to my pc set up 
positive,really nice mouse smooth responsive the clicks are pretty noiseless this is my first wireless rgb mouse get so far not disappointed you can also use it while connected to the charging cable 
neutral,the mouse only worked if it was plugged in not at all wireless like it says
positive,solid wireless keyboard and the best bang for your buck very mobile and responsive crispy boy spill proof 
positive,fantastic sound and perfectly sized to be conveniant and the play time goes on longer than what is advertized ive got the jbl charge as well and in party mode they are incredible jbl you guys are killen it with the bluetooth portable speakers what can say except jbl rocks thanks to you and amazon above and beyond all expectations 
positive,i ve had this unit for several years the sound is fine as some have described the sound is definitely on the warm end of the spectrum and the highs are bit lacking but the performance is better than expected at this price point anyway no one should expect super high fidelity from low cost portable speaker we use ours to stream music when we are by the pool or in the hot tub and to listen to audiobooks around the house it is great for these applications the battery lasts long time we often go week or more without needing charge the usb connection is handy now that more and more devices are using this standard the bluetooth connectivity is outstanding it connects seamlessly and reliably and seems to have quite good range far less finicky and fussy than other bluetooth devices we use the unit is durable although advertised as water resistant and absolutely not spec for this my unit fell into the hot tub and floated there for two days was wondering where it went looked all over the house my spouse suggested checking the hot tub sure enough there it was expected it to be dead nope it fine do not recommend immersing the unit in water am sure we got lucky nevertheless we were impressed 
neutral,it doesn work
positive,i love the sleek design of this mouse my favorite aspect though is the quiet clicking the noise is muted and that is an unexpected bonus 
positive,the main thing for me is that it is really pretty maybe that just girl reason to like it but am girl and an artist and maybe wee bit eccentric want stuff around me to add to my environment especially now other than that well its mouse it does all the same things other computer mice do and it does it well and its pretty 
positive,so far so good looks cool and feels good would buy again

neutral,left button not working after months for not worth it save you money and look for better one the last 
neutral,bought for my son to use with his xbox one only to find out it requires adaptor to even work for the buy wireless version and end up with better product 
neutral,for gaming
neutral,iove the sleep mode that turns off the keyboard while it not being used would still recommend turning it off when not in use 
positive,one of the best wireless keyboards ve had so far 
negative,i bought this two weeks ago and it already does not work it is cheaply made and am very disappointed 
neutral,doesn hold charge for very long
positive,this product is amazing for consoles such as ps or xbox use the microphone for my ps and my friends love it they are trying to get their own pair for themselves right now really like the mic quality and the noise suspension there is barely any background noise recommend getting pair for yourself
neutral,ergonomic
neutral,it cool guess
positive,great quality speaker my hubby loves the camo color one little pricey but got it when it went on sale 
positive,great birthday gift for my granddaughter
negative,i bought it for gaming and everyday use it stopped working really fast it lags behind which was driving me crazy then it just died after month don waste your money

neutral,disliked
neutral,this mouse feels very smooth and lightweight easy to use and one charge seems to last forever
neutral,very good product 
positive,i was impressed with the first ve bought for my boys had to get rd for myself no problems connect mouse to my laptop love the lights on it easy to glide easy to use
positive,overall really like the product the response time is awesome for typing gaming and more would give this product solid or stars however only got it in late december to replace keyboard had for or years have now had this keyboard for total of months and already the on off switch is starting to fail have to turn it on and off several times before it will turn on sometimes it won come back out of sleep mode causing me to have to turn it off and back on again repeating the process few times until it finally works once it on it works great honestly expected more out of product that cost me dollars have had logitec and other brands of keyboards throughout the years and they generally last me couple of years at least while really enjoy this keyboard overall the short term time it took for it to start degrading is unfortunate am hopeful that mine is just bad one rather than it being the standard because the range response time and lighting on this keyboard is awesome otherwise have had and dollar keyboards that lasted longer the return window ended in january so guess will be looking for new keyboard that serves my needs better 
positive,although they have different version of their keyboard where you can change the lighting scheme would have love to purchase this one with the ability to do that as well as offering it with mouse combo 
negative,i love how quiet it was without hearing clicking at every move but unfortunately it started stalling freezing and just unusable in less than month

positive,fun and great to use 
positive,absolutely love this speaker very loud durable and has great battery life 
neutral,very good
positive,loved it until the wheel quit after five months
neutral,it decent headphone but the noise cancelation is not the best but overall recommend you get this headset to start with as beginner gamer 
neutral,this stopped functioning after one week of use 
positive,nice keyboard overall the tactile feedback is pleasant although don like the placement of the key the colorful backlight is cool but some keyboard shortcuts simply do not work ctrl shift for example doesn work if you use the left ctrl shift keys that pretty outrageous since that is very common shortcut used in many apps on most operating systems it not just my keyboard this is apparently known issue with the keyboard don know how klim can sell keyboard with known defect and without warning about it 
positive,this is great and affordable keyboard great response time feels great to type on useful in the dark and long lasting battery 
neutral,i not buying batteries 
neutral,i literally have complaints use this at work at half volume both the kitchen work in and the kitchen connected to mine can hear the music the reason we put it at half volume is because at full volume you can hear it all the way throughout the lobby from the back door of the kitchen even over all the sounds of the ovens timers and customers talking hands down would recommend this to anyone 
positive,i love this mouse it works perfectly and not all that tech savvy
positive,love the sound and the comfort of the headset 
positive,the sound quality on these headphones are really good one of my friends who uses them for gaming recommended them to me and said they ve last him long time so far ve had no issues the sound cancelation is also amazing compared to my last pair of headphones
positive,love the speaker sound quality is good however we have had the hardest time the speaker willpower off and then somehow power itself back on it randomly turns on and you randomly connect to it tried customer service but couldn get anyone on the phone who could hear me clearly or understand english now have speaker have to keep plugged in and disconnect and turn off blue tooth or it just automatically connects 
positive,my husband absolutely loves it and the quality of the sound he takes it to work in vacation and outside when he is working in the back excellent value 
positive,great sound and good battery life 
positive,as advertised love that you can really hear the clicks charge it once week and use it approx to hrs week on color changing setting easy set up would buy again only thing don like is the short charging cable which is personal preference you would need usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it charging 
neutral,my boys use it for school they have encountered zero problems
positive,my granddaughter loves this for her gaming system
positive,i so happy that purchased this mouse it sleek and it easy to use enjoy the light component it adds uniqueness the mouse is light weight the usb chip is easy to keep up with because it fits in small space underneath the mouse that way the chip never gets lost also like the idea that can charge the mouse and never have to worry about an internal battery malfunctioning highly recommend this mouse for purchase 
positive,it is great headset for my son he loves it 
neutral,i have only used it for few months and it already broke when dropped it on the floor it too fragile 
neutral,the cord is very long and usually gets in the way when first got my it would make static noises and also echo other people suggest getting different mic 
positive,this is great bluetooth speaker love jbl and this little speaker did not disappoint 
neutral,good 
positive,set up couldn be easier put the white usb thing into my computer and the mouse magically worked that all it took got the gold rose and it very pretty

negative,speaker after week it has sound problems not satisfy with the product
positive,super easy to use just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the usb cord as needed kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise 
positive,i read so many reviews and went back and forth on whether to get this speaker now that ve heard it sound quality so glad decided to go with this charge speaker the sound is amazing and the battery last forever take it with me on the golf course and people wonder how this speaker can generate such great sound it little bigger than others but so worth the extra punch you get from the sound it generates
positive,i love it soon as got it got on the game and got my first win in free for all oh the led lights only come on when plug em in ur game so
negative,advertisement says three backlit effects and it is not true overall not bad keyboard but marketing is fraud 
positive,great keyboard slim durable long lasting battery great connection bought other brands and returned them all this is the best wireless keyboard 
positive,first headset own and its just great thanks
positive,nice springy keys that are smooth to type comfortable arrangement and like the backlight also very thoughtful letter from the manufacturers would highly recommend keep it up 
negative,i have had this mouse for month and other than like the colors it is worthless have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic tried recharging and it is no better and today it just died in the middle of zoom meeting was hosting am flushing it and making note to never purchase this brand again

positive,looks feels great love all the colors 
negative,it only worked for months and then it died have used different mouses before for years and have never experienced moused died until this one died 
positive,it functions very well as wireless mouse the usb adapter it comes with is very handy for the new apple computers which only have usb ports the lights are cool as well but more importantly the mouse is sturdy and doesn feel cheap 
neutral,only worked for few months bought for son for christmas already broke
positive,i love the keyboard just wish there was switch to keep the lights on while using it but actually understand that it would require it to be charged more so either way love the freaking keyboard it made my work life little more simplified 
positive,the pictures are how the product arrived it was packaged in cheap plastic bag and the box was mutated this was supposed to be gift for my son and didn have time to replace it the delivery was late which would have been just fine if it didn arrive like this didn work not sure if it didn work because of the delivery or because of the product do not buy this you will not get what you were expecting 
positive,great quality for the price
neutral,battery lasts forever smooth and sleek design if you use the middle mouse button it little hard to click but that literally the only downside would recommend this mouse to anyone else looking for an affordable sleek mouse 
neutral,amazing headset but my only complaint is the people talking to me in discord were hearing themselves talk through the headset and into my mic back to them so had to work on and fix that beside that no complaints
neutral,this product stopped working for me after two days it was fine but now it no longer charges and doesn even work while it plugged in 
neutral,just bought it week ago and thus far nothing to complain about my son had had one do quite while and he has had no issues so not anticipating any either 
positive,cute light weight very easy to use love this mouse 
neutral,stop working after few days do not buy this mouse 
neutral,u can go wrong with this
positive,it perfect for my office used since we are still working remotely really nice product for the price 
positive,great value for the money for an illuminated wireless keyboard very responsive 
negative,overall liked the feel and responsiveness but the durability was the big issue this mouse was for work computer with light everyday use and within less than two months it would no longer charge or work properly took it apart to verify the battery was making connection and even replaced the battery however the mouse still would not track properly perhaps just got dud but decided to spend few more dollars and purchase different brand 
neutral,this is second time ve bought this mouse and its broken on me within few months it just decides to work only when it wants to 
positive,great
positive,solid comfortable headset that doesn squeeze your brain cheap and pretty sturdy and quality for the price could noise cancel better better sound quality than expected perfect gift for the youngins
neutral,they are not compatible with xbox and therefore advertising falsely don care that they work with an adapter not included any headphones work with an adapter therefore false advertising 
neutral,buyer beware used the keyboard for almost year and it was pretty solid no complaints but recently went to charge the keyboard and the charging port started to smoke and burned the port and charging cable almost caused fire in the office 
neutral,product is extremly cheap looks like something from five below or wish you can see right through it and it dies really fast im sad missed the return window but will be buying new product
positive,i have had this mouse for two weeks for the first few days it worked great nothing has changed with my work setup fresh batteries clean underside with mouse pad and it continues to lag disappointed in the product 
neutral,nice comfy and also very smooth

neutral,broke after one month went to plug it in and the charging port pushed way back inside the mouse and when opened the mouse up to fix it the piece had busted off completely 
neutral,easy to use charge lasts long time
neutral,i had high expectations and it exceeded them all 
positive,excellent
positive,it nice little mouse it actually pretty high quality for how cheap it was
negative,pros wireless ease of use feels nice soft smooth sleek dampened click quietcons it has very loud scroll button the wheel works fine but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud so it slightly defeats the purpose of quiet mouse no additional buttons such as back or forward additional you have to charge the mouse with the included usb charger
neutral,for me really liked the headset not to loud great sound quality and at good price if you re looking for wireless this one is not 
negative,looks like the track wheel is connected to an internal device using very fragile thin piece of plastic was simply using the mouse didn drop it or slam it and suddenly the tactile feedback of using the track wheel stopped and the mouse would no longer scroll the screen too bad actually liked the mouse until then 
positive,has extra usb cable by audio cable helps it work better and for all the lights all over them cord is long over all kid is satisifirmd until he breaks them like the previous he has already 
neutral,iy works so what can one say about mouse 
positive,this keyboard is extremely comfortable to type on and the backlight makes it possible to type with the lights off 
negative,i ordered silver and received black not worth the time to return it but bit disappointing quality functions as expected
positive,i bought it for my daughter and she loved it this mouse is very light well designed and easy to use light up is also very nice feature 
positive,great sound however it didn come with charging cable for expected charging cable but it does sound great and it has an aux input 
negative,doesn work at all the two pieces barely even connect let alone to the laptop waste of time and money cheaply made 
positive,great sound
positive,headphones were great for my son the ear cushions were comfortable and overall the headphones fit great the other ones he had started to be too small for him he loved the lights and to be able to mute the mic from the headphones on the downside they only lasted him months at first the mic kept going in and out them the sound started acting up now have to get replacement at least these headphones didn physically fall apart like others have 
positive,its sleek the blush is cute color like the colored lights also works well
neutral,went on river float and now it doesn work not waterproof not going to buy this one again will have to research bit for my next float
neutral,works great charge lasts long time no more batteries 
positive,first ever gaming headset and it awesome fits comfortably and is great for talking and listening 
neutral,worth the money use it every time go to the water 
positive,is not the best have try but for the price works very good and is pretty accurate
positive, cute colorful small lightweight quiet soft clicks easy quick set up 
positive,works as advertised has good action and the lights are fun 
positive,it soft click which like love the colors and truly get about weeks of using it as my work mouse 
positive,they sound pretty good and they feel reasonably comfortable but they feel cheap and the audio output is terrible the guys play with don really understand what saying most of the time so spent bit more money and got myself nice pair they re decent backup pair edit bengoo just reached out to me to refund the product if changed my review respect them trying to make it right but on the other hand don like review bribery
neutral,these look really nice but the sound quality is awful not enough volume at all 
positive,i love my jbl bluetooth speaker use it daily and really enjoy the music it significant upgrade over my tablet speaker 
neutral,returned since it was missing the usb adapter this is the only reason why purchased it since needed usb port for my flashdrive 
positive,super comfortable to use 
positive,my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider 
positive,mic works well and the set is great for gaming it has good sound volume but not too loud
negative,ok for gaming the sound is already failing on one side very disappointed 
positive,seems to work great kids love it
positive,sleek quite cool light effect great price for rechargeable mouse no more batteries to replace 
neutral,just ordered this as nice wireless mouse for my surface pro it works nice but when went to pull the usb out of the surface pro part of it stayed stuck in the port had to use pliers to pull it out not sure if this just tight fit or poor workmanship other than that the mouse works fine 
positive,sound quality is excellent we play it for more than hours day and the battery life is great 
positive,the mic does not work but the sound quality is great
positive,great mouse for the price nice and soft matte feel very quite clicks perfect for working in coffee shop works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces and connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software note rgb lights are not customizable but still cute as heck and works great 
positive,has worked great until now charged it and now it won turn back on can return it either not worth the money 
positive,if you want quality sound to blast while you dance on your own while cleaning the kitchen or working on super dope motorcycle in the garage or while you roast mores up the canyon around toasty bonfire while celebrating the joys of lasting friendships buy this speaker it small enough to toss in backpack and big enough to pack an audio superpunch the battery life is amazing and can go days without charging it bluetooth connection is great and you can pair it to multiple devices which is huge win for jbl would buy again 
positive,my son loves his new headphones
positive,update days later and the receiver has started to experience an internal fault it is loosing connection with my pc and acting as if removed the receiver from the usb port windows is even playing disconnected chime moving to new port does not fix the problem it uses windows drivers so there no update it seems to have started about week after the last version update am running windows version maybe it needs firmware update also if you go to the website listed for support in the us they don have any electronics on the site only outdoor gear confusing plus it not support they are only open mst pros will start by saying that appreciate that the charging port is type that makes it easier to charge given that most pc electronics are going that way the battery lasts about week between charges for me with about hours of use per day it also lot more responsive than my old wireless logi ch keyboard like noticed difference in rocket league immediately backlight is ok have it set to solid and med bright cons it not true rgb backlight there are only options for color on the lighting wave or solid on it just different color leds in the backlight the keyboard layout is also different from my old keyboard the enter key is tall instead of double key width so when type end up hitting the key instead of enter and when you re in game short on time you don need missed keys if you want an rgb keyboard this is not the one you want if you want responsive wireless keyboard with multicolor backlight this might be the one for you 
neutral,very excited for the speaker bought it to have on weekend camping trip but didn realize it was going to come without full charger left me unable to charge it as my other charger doesn disconnect into block and cord it stays as one now have to buy wall block in order to charge this speaker already spend lot of money on seems like real cheap way to save money as company 
neutral,not sure why this died after couple months of use but it is no longer working bummer because it was super cute and added to my office aesthetic 
positive,i charged this mouse one time for an hour and it been going for month now on that one charge the clicks are silent love this comfortable mouse edit loved it until the scroll wheel stopped working 
positive,looks good feels good volume too low tried adjusting in game not loud enough
neutral,i was concerned that this would be difficult to setup but was shocked on how easy it was to connect 
positive,my son needed decent headphones with microphone for virtual distance learning for school he enjoys these they work they are comfortable for his hours of meetings he likes the fact that they light up overall buy again 
negative,functional mouse but it is hard to click with fingers extra effort needed which is not good probably won buy this again 
neutral,basically battery quit taking charge then had to mail it in to get another the turn around was quick 
positive,this speaker has great sound and volume the battery last long time with intermittent use my kids are always borrowing it because it works so well 
positive,havent really had time to really try them out but have worked great so far on one game
positive,picked white colour and love it so much very stylish and cool great music quality with strong base and the volume is high enough and this is my first time to purchase jbl unexpectedly good experience highly recommended 
neutral,i love how long the wire is as well as the ability to not use the led light there is also knob on the device to lower or raise the volume wished the mic would go bit closer to the mouth area but seems to be all right for now 
positive,great sound quality and comfortable my kid loves em 
positive,ordered this for my new laptop works like charm includes charging cable adapter and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely contacted them about activating warranty my only issue with this mouse is the shape which was more flat than the mice used to using but that is just personal preference and got used to it very quickly overall great product 
neutral,quality product
neutral,mouse was very light and would keep charge adapter broke week after got it 
positive,love it slim line and fits in laptop bag much nicer than my old one and it pretty 
positive,i bought second speaker to have it in stereo but notice while having it that the other speaker cut off few seconds other then that it feels like brand new speaker if want true stereo need to by splitter and connect both as normal speakers for my laptop plus the syncing with youtube is pretty bad with videos it sounds clear and loud oh and one last thing about in stereo mode on and iphone it works with one app at time so use it on youtube for one day with the jbl connect and then use it with google music another day when you sync the stereo mode with the audio app you that you want to use it on windows its basically party mode and no real stereo mode did this with my laptop and one speaker sync in and the other sync in bit slower of seconds to sync in this is why give it stars but over rall can charge my phone or use each one as speaker louder then my phone cant use it as google or alexa voice activator or even siri but as two speakers in stereo is good on ios on my iphone but cant do it on windows 
neutral,just had mouse for months and it has stopped working 
positive,my home schooling student enjoyed the lights but it has stopped working entirely after months too late to return so fun for awhile but don expect it to last 
positive,the item is actually nice the size color and lights are very cute and love that is rechargeable the only issue encounter was that when you leave it idle for few seconds and then try to use it it gets super slow and lags have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal don know if that is feature to save power or if mine is defective ll try to reach out to the seller has anyone else experienced this issue

positive,it works great used it for my school and it works really well 
positive,i really wasnt expecting this to sound and be as good as it is can literally hear the speaker from outside my house while the bass is the main star of the show it leaves me little disappointed that the treble and other minor but important rythms get drowned out lot of the time it could also be the music play so cant fault it too much overall really glad got what paid for and bit more as well
positive,just excellent all round attractive nice key touch acnt fault it use for gaming and video editing great product 
neutral,this is my second charge speaker they have nice sound portable and water resistant 
negative,this mouse worked well for about months then it stopped holding charge even tethered to the laptop it was not working well but why buy wireless mouse if it needs to be used wired and why use wired mouse if it doesn even work don waste your money ll go pull out my ancient wired mouse that works

positive,scrolling is very easy and quick this mouse is slim and easy to manuver mostly love the ergonomic and backlighting design the sleep mode feature is nice just have to remember to turn the mouse off then on to reactivate the scrolling feature 
negative,this mouse only worked for weeks then it died very disappointed
positive,this is such an excellent product it quiet it in no way ever bothers my carpal tunnel and the colors are rich and vibrant the battery charge lasts for quite some time too additionally the customer service is second to none my usb dongle sadly disappeared in move and they replaced it free of charge no less within days of my email to tech support they provided ample instructions on how to sync the new receiver and even included candy in the package as friendly touch cannot brag enough about how great klim is 
positive,love it

negative,used few hours day for weeks it is totally dead 
negative,keeps losing signal in the keys even with the cord in doesn stay charged long bad for gaming 
neutral,i wouldn buy this headset simply because the mic on it picks up little sound and you have to be very loud to get good quality
neutral,automatically sets up 
positive,the food is delicious the client service is perfect can wait to come back with my children
neutral,didn work 
neutral,started out pretty nice but after weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly even after charging all night after about minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements update the vendor keeps sending me emails asking me to delete this review for guessing they don want me to write this on the review but ve told them no three times now and they just sent another one ve told them that it unethical ve told them its completely against the spirit of reviews in the first place and there another one in my inbox sigh guess just forward another one to the customer service department of amazon 
positive,i was bit skeptical about it being quiet clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet the clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the click my only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly the lights are enjoyable but don display constant stream of colors as they forcibly manually change when moved or clicked they otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle overall it really nice mouse to buy and use comfortable and light kind of reminds me of the apple mouse 
negative,tried to return it today will not hold charge requires different charging cord than iphone cost to much for how bad product is plus ordered protective carrying case separate would not ever purchase again just ordered new bose waterproof speaker 
positive,perfect size for small hands
positive,i needed mouse for my laptop for around the same price as big name mouse you can get mouse that works just as well and looks cool with it led lights and it rechargeable the lights can be switched off if they are too distracting but admit like them it isn quite as ergonomic as some mice but it fits nicely into my laptop bag usb receiver is small enough to leave in my laptop without it getting yanked out 
positive,this mouse was amazing when first got it and it worked amazing for the first few months then started having connecting issues so direct hooked it up to my pc and it worked like that for day now it doesnt work at all dont waste your money on this

negative,its just literally not working at all charged it for three hours and connected the usb to the adapter and plugged it in to my macbook and it just does not work have turned it on and off put the usb back in the mouse and tried again and again and it just will not work instructions were absolutely useless since it just said to turn the mouse on and off 
positive,i got these for my step daughter she really likes them lot they are very comfortable and she says she been able to wear them for up to hrs with no issues 
negative,did not work with our gaming console or others bought another brand no issues with it received defective product
positive,wonderful sound battery life is amazing ve only charged it times since bought it and it been three months of me having it only down side at full volume the bass starts to get messy that aside buy this again if had the chance to 
positive,i have gotten so many compliments on this mouse first off the rose gold color is so beautiful and dainty when first started using fell in love that in changes colors and has the capability to turn off highly recommend great price as well 
positive,sleep mode turns on too fast for me however really enjoy the mouse overall just use for work travel not gaming 
negative,i would not recommend this item bought this for my daughter for school it quit working after two weeks was going to buy another one but decided to wait to see how this one would work so glad didn buy another one when put it on the charger it does not work would not recommend this item at all if you buy it you re wasting your money we liked it because the light so tried to put it onto another charger and it did not work either so don know what the problem is would not recommend this do not buy it here an update keep receiving emails from the seller wanted me to change my review don think that how it should work because the item did not work they want me to change my review to good review or they want me to delete it and pay me money for it so now this is the second email have received the first email they wanted to pay me the second email they want to pay me when you buy something online your post to do review of your item so do not recommend this item
positive,i liked how good this product was for its price 
negative,i ve had the jbl for year now and it messed up on me haven damaged it in any way and it has difficulty turning off and on don recommend this speaker 
positive,bought thus for my daughter with new gaming computer she loves it and the colors match her headphones
neutral,the mic quality is more clearer than if you were to plug your plain headphones in it more decent sound quality the build is pretty light due to plastic structure but what do you expect from dollar purchase 
neutral,the first day it worked great but the second day it barely tracks at all and when try and click on anything to open documents or emails it takes several tries before it works what waste of money going back to my old mouse 
positive,work very well and easy to set up you can charge it with your computer the best thing is no need for batteries
neutral,the usb broke off in my computer and had trouble removing it finally got it out with finger nail clippers was happy with it until this happened 
positive,love the color love the sound blockout
negative,love the slimline appearance and the changing colors the colors add sense of fun to normally mundane piece of computer equipment also love the ability to keep it one color red or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor good product well designed make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on off switch but has three positions this is now october this mouse broke after little use while traveling the scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless this appears to be poor design and weak point in this item and would now not recommend it have had other computer mice for years without this issue 
negative,after two days of using the mouse went dead and would not work again no matter how long charged it 
neutral,awsome headset
neutral,returned since it was missing the usb adapter this is the only reason why purchased it since needed usb port for my flashdrive 
neutral,overall it is good keyboard but it runs out of battery really fast my own does not hold on for more than or days would expect to hold the battery for or weeks or even months every week have to connect into the usb port to recharge when connected to usb port still have to connect the bluetooth adapter which makes me use an extra usb port why not just use the usb cabe to also communicate with the pc why do have to use both while charging the keyboard 
neutral,i used this very infrequently and the spinning wheel broke within couple months 
positive,my husband is gamer and was in need of new keyboard he chose this one because it had everything he wanted and needed especially the wireless feature as he likes to lay back and not worry about dealing with cords pretty sure he dropped it on his desk few times and it is still going the colors are vibrant types well and looks very nice highly recommend this great value 
neutral,finally hopped on the jbl chain and do not regret it one bit 
neutral,loved the mouse and was using it regularly for months just recently the scrolling wheel completely stopped working all of the other functions work but the scrolling feature is must for me 
positive,the mouse is very slim but is so cheaply made don dare drop it or it going to break won by another one
positive,very smooth use love the different colors 
neutral,pretty didn work
neutral,good speaker
negative,horrible
neutral,it good for lighting up mouse but isn for gaming really
positive,great sound quality for the money cancels background noise perfectly really comfortable to wear product will buy again 
neutral,i purchased two jbl charge speakers one of them quit working within month do like the sound out of the smaller jbl charge better than the charge also the charge has microphone so you can use it as speakerphone the charge only has one speaker so it is not even stereo jbl is very difficult to work with they sent me charge claiming it was better than the charge for the replacement but it is not and you don even get charger to charge the battery on the charge if was to do it again believe would stay away from jbl 
negative,terrible product battery would never last more than hours and after little over month it stopped working altogether would not recommend this product 
positive,for small sucker pumps loud and clear love it def taking it with me on vacations 
negative,this pair of headphones has worked really well for me plan on buying another pair because my current pair has gotten damaged due to my putting the pair on uneven surfaces and the wires have been tugged on too much knocked the head phones down on accident several times walked while wearing these head phones and dropped my phone the cord itself got accidentally tugged and unplugged from my phone won be using these headphones outside my room anymore also my room is well enough organized now that shouldn end up knocking them over on accident anymore 
positive,they are comfortable and work great 
positive,we bought three of these for christmas party they can be linked and volume can be controlled individually they sound great and lasted the whole party without having to be charged they are small enough to not be cumbersome but large enough to fill room with sound very impressed for the money 
neutral,i was looking for simple black led mouse for work and this one is exactly what was looking for it works great and have had no issues yet due to the size it can be little uncomfortable if you are doing lot of work using the mouse for an extended amount of time but this has only happened to me once 
positive,cool mouse slim and comfortable 
positive,i don like using my mouse on my laptop so having mouse is helpful and then it lights up 
neutral,it works well
neutral,it not very responsive but it does work the lights are terrible but it does light up as far as adjusting the dpi did not see difference at all would not recommend for gaming but if you wanna surf the web on smart tv its works well 
positive,some keyboards have very flat keys and have hard time feeling the keys these are great because the keys are slightly recessed in the middle 
neutral,like how it fits in my hand but it kept stop working then after months stopped all together do not get it
neutral,decent for the price it works as described 
neutral,broke within few months
negative,bought this in june it dead plus when in wireless mode frequently multiple times per day the mouse drops connection cheap product would rather have working product 
positive,best speaker ever bought worth the money
positive,works perfectly 
negative,the sound quality of this product is very bad
positive,it all fun and cute at the beginning but after month in half past my refund window and it has stopped working tried charging it nothing extremely disappointed 
neutral,no complaint great product
neutral,mouse works good so far only thing that is disappointing is when put the switch to the color setting it starts to change colors but also stops working while its on the on position it lights up red which is better than nothing at least 
neutral,loved everything about this mouse until the charging jack came loose after three months of use there is no way to charge it now guess you get what you pay for 
positive,i bought this for my daughter for christmas she listens to it for hours daily easy to connect long lasting battery cute color 
neutral,if you have an extremely large head then this is the headset for you mean round head like basketball or balloon shape head if you don don bother they re just going to fall off your head
positive,i ve had this for one month it was inconsistent on how long the charge lasted from new and now it won charge at all 
positive,i love this it stays charged for weeks
neutral,good audio
positive,the mouse is colorful addition to my desk and unlike other computer mice have owned it does not have thumb operated controls on its left side where left handed person like myself would unintentionally press button and start function they didn want to activate ve only had it for about week so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged the light display draws significant amount of power so need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever shut down the pc 
positive,i bought these head phones for my year old grandson and he loves them he loves the noise canceling feature and the lighting up in blue is an extra bonus 
positive,a little difficult trying to tie to of them together finally found the trick turn both on let them automatically connect to phone one connected hit the stereo mode buttons at same time for me it worked every time have to buy two atleast because in stereo mode they sound great bass is decent not as much as like but they have great sound quality so if your sound quality and not bass person these are good 
neutral,you can hardly maneuver the clicker with this mouse it doesn do its main function the led is ok guess but what the point of mouse that doesn do it job guess have new flashlight give stars if could don waste your time or money on this 
positive,this thing is awesome it came charged when it was delivered and ve used it pretty much daily in the classroom during the week weeks later it finally died sound quality is great too well worth the money
neutral,sounds great mic came broken
positive,i have several friends with jbl so knew what was getting but don know how lived my life before just listening to music on my phone day to day haha 
positive,great item
neutral,i assumed this speaker would sound better than the jbl flip that have but not convinced as of yet maybe after listening to it for while ll change my mind 
positive,for gaming and even for non gaming gripe have about this headset is the volume and mic controller it like you have remote control super glued on the cord and it swings around and knocks up against your arm or chair the usb cable is also an annoying addition it cool for people who want glowing headsets but for people who don need to waste the energy for the lights it an additional cord just hanging off of your laptop or desktop so the design could definitely be better as for the noise cancellation not completely sure what noise cancelling these headsets actually have tested the mic and even with the mic all the way up you have to manually mute yourself using the volume controller otherwise people can still hear you but you will seem like you re far away from the computer the sound quality is okay played games and watched movies with these while watching shows movies with just the aux mm jack did notice some voice echoing this isn super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this the headset does have cushy padding on the ears but it seems pretty small so for those with larger ears these might be more of on ear headphones rather than over ear ones the cushion does eventually hurt to keep the headset on for an extended period of time but hoping after wearing the cushion down bit the comfortability will increase overall the headset is okay since got it on sale it decent set of headphones 
neutral,day used it on my gaming pc huge issues this headset by default will default itself to the speakers microphone on your pc laptop under the default settings making it very hard to make games and discord to detect the headset and ultimately cuck you re stream setting abilities after hours of fiddling with settings finally was able to make it work correctly day doesn work at all now microphone works but the headset now doesn produce any sound and yes did make sure my volume was turned all the way up through the hardware and software sides understand that chose cheap product to fulfill my needs of headset but don out right sell faulty and useless product waste of time and money 
positive,this is the best headset and are very pleased 
positive,great sound easy to use happy with our choice 
positive,yes do it buy em the audio quality is outstanding pretty experienced in av ans high end audio and these arent disappointingfoe the price the range is excellent the ability to link multiple units always impresses guest should be sponsored because ve had about friends buy these once they heard them take them to the beach on vacation in hotels the park powerful 
positive, small lightweight charged pretty fast and lasted quite while perfect for what we need recommend 
positive,multi use can use this mouse for anything you need to get done smooth slick and overall perfect performance 
neutral,mouse works good so far only thing that is disappointing is when put the switch to the color setting it starts to change colors but also stops working while its on the on position it lights up red which is better than nothing at least 
neutral,works well 
positive, oh my god this was everything was looking for bought mouse and keyboard for my phone because wanted to type my essays on my phone when don have computer and this mouse works on my phone yay and it my favorite color
positive,buy it and love it you won regret it 
neutral,no instructions in english sleep mode no ideaworks fine and the color changing is cute
positive,i bought jbl charge recently it is excellently crafter extremely durable produces well rounded sounds for enhanced music experience for normal people frankly of population with budget of would recommend charge series speakers recently compared it with the shrill voiced marshall emberton that wanted to buy as had heard so much about it and charge is clear winner for normal ears durability water performance base power battery life looks color options and most of all the music that jbl charge produces is way more superior that emberton similar to our routine lives only ears and good judgement were used for comparison no technical sensors were used for testing am not associated in any way with jbl or hk or marshall or any other music speaker brand 
positive,perfect just what needed love that can use with my mac and pc mouse is smooth fast and accurate

neutral,this product has malfunctioned and been glitchy sine the day got it the bluetooth never worked properly with the unit automatically disconnecting and shutting off kept assuming operator error but that is not the case have done factory reset and googled troubleshooting have barely used it and it no longer charges intermittently connects on bluetooth for few days this speaker would work when directly connected to my phone however after minutes the unit automatically turns off while plugged in to power troubleshoot on the web revealed many problems don buy this 
positive,i really liked the mouse at first it matched perfectly and was very convenient first thing noticed was how plasticy it was that didn bother me tho one day as was using the mouse to scroll the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse tried to fix it and couldn wasn pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk its cute mouse love the look of it but it is very cheaply made and will most likely break 
positive,love the sound system great buy
neutral,this mouse does what it needs for the most part however the cursor itself will jump all over the page from time to time which is annoying 
negative,its really bad
positive, feels good in my hand and works well the roller wheel works as third button which is important for my work colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that bonus it charges so no batteries and loving that the only issue finding is that it goes to sleep very fast if you wait to long to move it you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel not big deal just annoying sometimes overall happy with it 
positive,for the price its been great functionality is good light weight can go wrong 
neutral,i would not recommend this keyboard loved it at first until the keys started breaking just from typing broken keys in the first month alone
positive,i was totally amazed by this little speaker 
positive,excellent product and works well
neutral,my mouse never worked charged it the first day for the recommended time when tried to use it it powered on briefly and then powered completely off thought it must not have charged completely so charged it again and again and again each time it did the same thing just threw it away never even got to use it 
positive,looks just like the picture don know about sleep mode or gaming as use it for my office the only thing wish was different was that the charge be updated to the newer charger like my samsung phone and laptop 
negative,it was decent while it lasted but died on me one month after the warranty expired so very disappointed in this product would definitely not recommend it 
neutral,changed the batteries out twice the keyboard must be plugged in to work once you unplug it from the wall it dies 
neutral,used on mac laptop
neutral,it took one week of using this mouse before deciding to just get better quality mouse 
positive,i glad that ordered this keyboard it been nice gaming on it 
neutral,stopped tracking well after week of use waste of money spend little more and get better quality mouse to begin with with 
neutral,easy to use very light weight

negative,i have had of these the first mouse ordered worked fine until the mouse just felt loose and didn respond was able to get replacement and was satisfied the replacement did the same thing got it in jan and today the scroll wheel just felt loose and didn respond waste of money do not recommend

positive,had bit of an issue but the customer service was fantastic and corrected it fast 
positive,loved these so much bought another one they re great theyre nice and big with long cord so no tugging or accidentally pulling the cord out the sound quality is great you re able to hear even the smallest sounds on the game definitely recommend 
neutral,they know the microphones are faulty they know the microphones only work for like week the seller doesn matter the brand doesn matter there are million versions of these cheap headsets pros they are loud enoughcons the microphone will break it not maybe it will break also they didn have the giant usb portion of the wire in the photos had to cut it off thus was advertised as pc and console headphones do any of you know console controller with usb port for led lights on headphones didn think so don buy these for console and go ahead and rip the microphone off 
positive,in my opinion if you dive too deep into youtube reviews regarding decibel comparisons etc etc you ll never end up buying any speaker keeping it simple can tell you this is an awesome portable speaker for it price range take it to the community pool bbq outdoor family events and it perfect long lasting battery good bluetooth connectivity and packs pretty good punch in both volume and bass would maybe consider the larger jbl xtreme if it goes on sale but in all honesty this charge is perfect for what use it for portability to me is more important that little higher volume and bass love the speaker well done jbl 
positive,this baby is great works perfect with my macbook pro and love that it rechargeable 
positive,seems to me that the left ctrl shift issue has been resolved can go into adobe illustrator and press ctrl shift and it will copy and paste in place for me that all really use it for lighting isn too bright but has nice ambiance to it no adjustment like their mouse their mouse as driver which can control more wish the keyboard had that keys had slim keyboard before and like playing on that little bit more keys are fairly quiet the keys are also taller so my fingers need to get used to it bit more bluetooth connectivity seems to be working good didn have any input lag
positive,awesome headset for the price 
neutral,like it
neutral,this mouse is cheap and like the colors but the laser isn accurate so it can be slow and laggy occasionally its entirely unresponsive 
neutral,it broke
positive,the box was torn and there is scratch smudge on it hope it works well the colors are beautiful though love how the white mouse looks it very clean stars because of the smudge can get off and packaging it obvious not the first one to own it

positive,i purchased this to replace broken battery operated cordless mouse think dropped it one too many times thought would give this rechargeable mouse try hope that won have to recharge it too often only had to do the initial charge so far and do lot of clicking also chose this one for its flatter design my other one was higher and after using it long time my hand got stiff maybe this one won do that so far it hasn 
negative,does not pair well at all with jbl connect bought this to connect to my jbl boombox it paired and did the whole jbl connect which jbl specifically offers it worked for about month then started having problems connection was lost in minute distortion even had them just foot apart and still dissapointing buy it for solo use not for jbl connect 
positive,lasted about months we bought cheap headset knowing they wouldn last long my son is hard in headsets so at this point it better to order cheap and replace often instead of really expensive ones that still don last good quality for the value
neutral,it works good for year but after the mic went out had to order new adapter and month later the mic stoped working agan the adapter was 
negative,this headset is complete garbage the usb plug wouldn work only lights up the headset using the audio plug the sound is staticy and you can barely hear at full volume listening to music video to test the sound was chopping cutting out the artists voice all over the place worst headset have ever used opened return immediately 
positive,love this mouse it small and slim works great and you can turn the lights on or off to meet your preference 
positive,i just got this keyboard for my stepdad as was building him new pc ended up opening and using it to complete the install of software like the size and feel it pretty light but doesn feel cheap buttons feel good quiet but good tactile feel haven played with color modes yet it charges pretty quick haven used it enough to say how long it lasts not deal breaker but be aware you still need to plug the dongle into usb port to use this keyboard even if you have it plugged into another usb port with the charging cable otherwise seems decent 
neutral,mouse worked fine for months charged it every week or so then wouldn charge via usb not good option for those who need something reliable 
neutral,it was great for the weeks it lasted after weeks it would light up as if it was charging but never would hold the charge 
neutral,very nice
neutral,you could think it decent mouse for the price you paid but in reality it is an uncomfortable mouse and barely works the only good thing about this mouse is that it comes with usb to usb adapter which comes in handy

neutral,bought this in the beginning of august and it already doesn work don waste your money 
positive,love the sleek look amazing sound quality and extremely comfortable padding

neutral,broken from box
neutral,update seller realized left star review and is now spamming me with gift card bribes to remove it if you are wondering how product with so many bad reviews somehow has over star rating it because they bribe buyers with gift cards to delete bad reviews or change them to stars original review purchased bengoo but the headset came in butfulake gh box pics attached no user manual included my mousepad came with more troubleshooting instructions for some reason gaming headset needed both usb plug and an audio jack good ones only need usb my windows pc didn recognize the usb when plugged in all other usb headsets in my household work fine with the same pc the blue ear lights go on but no audio or microphone available apparently you have to use the audio jack to make the sound work but still no working microphone with non functioning usb plug someone clearly tried to pass off their broken leftovers as new no idea how this seller and product became an amazon choice with strong customer ratings very scammy experience serves me right for trying to go cheap on electronics already started the return process 
positive,i love the color changing feature while using
neutral,normal daily use for few weeks scroller suddenly caved in today and stopped working positive reviews must be from people who haven owned it for long or mine was just damaged during shipping nevertheless honestly didn know computer mice could even break returning

positive,looks great comfortable in my hand
negative,bought them for my son they broke within year he could no longer hear audio waste of money
positive,if you re looking for portable speaker for casual outings or at home say this is great purchase if you re someone like me who works in the kitchen from hours this speaker probably isn worth it with it battery life kinda expected it but didn even have it on max and it ran out on my th hour which was actually almost over an hour off from my other speaker still had pretty large for something that looks like it would have longer charge but that kinda my only gripe at least it sounds nice 
positive,got it for my wife she seems to like it it looks nice and feels good in hand

positive,great speaker for the beach gets loud easy to carry and durable much preferred over our previous ultimate ears boom speaker 
negative,i purchased for our office the mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty but mine started having problems just few days later it was unresponsive and jerky for few days then it stopped working despite charging overnight tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn bad but it wouldn hold charge and died again within minutes when asked the other employee about his identical mouse different color he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn hold charge used the included cord and tried charging with the computer with hub with power strip and with charging block not included plugged into multiple outlets when returning packaged the items as requested and requested the pick up slip we found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office few days later not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door no one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn have found it if staff member hadn gone out to sanitize the outside door handles now we have to take it to drop off location because return pickup is going to cost despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller 
positive,great product and excellent food gaming and listening to music
neutral,the mouse itself is easy to use however the usb usbc adapter does not work couldn get the mouse to work with my macbook until bought different adapter

positive,great sound and bass
positive,best portable speaker ve owned out of purposely tested the waterproofing in snow sleet storm overnight months later it works like new still use it at work the beach the backyard and anywhere don use my headphones really the sound carries very well in open areas the bass carries alright but it still has it limits as portable the battery life is at least hrs of nearly consistent music and think maybe half phone charge as well everybody that sees it wants one 
positive,bought for special gift it was well received 
positive,easy to setup fit nice on the palm of your hand
positive,i like this wireless mouse for now hoping nothing goes wrong with it so far it been very dependable and works correctly the design is perfect and love the different colors it works the moment you connect the usb connector to the computer and turn the mouse on the only thing don like is how quickly it goes into sleep mode but that not too big of an annoyance 
positive,i ordered this mouse in the light blue color for an eight year old girl the mouse works well and she loves the bright and changing colors highly recommend 
positive,super easy to use and transport works with my pc
neutral,got them for use with my children who seem to destroy headphones by looking at them integrated mic works well for class and they are comfortable enough to be worn or the whole school day the cord is long enough it not getting yanked out all the time and it feels more durable than some of the thin wires on most inexpensive sets 
positive,the best 
neutral,gift
positive,better than the headsets ve bought definitely buying these from now on use on xbox series x
positive,hands down best speaker out there it water proof yucky dirt resistant can take it anywhere in the world it the best 
neutral,easy to use with sleek design 
neutral,worked beautifully for month and then the roller ball broke guess you get what you pay for 
neutral,don expect the bluetooth to work it didn work for my device but it works as mouse tried it gaming not the best recommend spending the extra cash for good gaming mouse but if you need or want mouse for clicking and dragging go ahead but the lights don turn off and again the bluetooth didn work for me it might work for you who knows 
positive,not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife she gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too 
neutral,just all around terrible mouse
positive,this keyboard lives up to everything that is promised in its description would recommend 
positive,im so inlove with this one not too small and not too big just perfect and the sound is so loud my kids loves the color

neutral,quiet clicker
positive,this thing is so smooth and so awesome highly recommend 
positive,great product would buy again love the lights 
positive,the mouse is so fast and good got the silver color and its so pretty especially at night easy set up
positive,it advertise change of color of the light mine is only red the buttons have to hit it very had to the point that started to click on the board because my finger hurt very pretty very sleek so far works very good 
positive,loved this mouse worked great after having it for months the scrolling piece in the middle broke was not rough with it did not drop it just stopped working out of nowhere 
positive,this speaker has amazing sound great battery life and fits anywhere you need it recommend it for any use in house or outdoors 
neutral,good sound
neutral,as much as want to give more stars for this product the fact that it is way too heavy on my head and gives me headaches is too big of an issue if the weight of the headset doesn bother you then definitely this is solid product but ve never felt so much weight from headset it kind of concerning that this is also gaming headset because the amount of time people will use it for gaming it can probably cause pain to your neck back in the long run would suggest looking for other products even if this product has lot of good reviews don think anyone should be having this much weight on their head even if it doesn bother them 
negative,sux stopped working after month of use will not charge 
neutral,easy to use and light
neutral,i like
neutral,sleek looking with lights but scroller on one did not work 
neutral,this mouse is very slow in reaction not sensitive to the movement and make my hand tiring already after minutes usage too bad only start using it after the return window closed 
neutral,my headphones arrived faulty and do not connect to my pc properly followed the setup instructions provided watched videos yet nothing helped returning these asap 
neutral,works great would prefer if it would not light up like rainbow 
positive,best keyboard had in while
neutral,no echo 
positive,awesome gaming headset 
positive,its super simple easy and fast to use if you want something wireless that good full sized keyboard but simply don have the budget to pay for the more expensive ones then this is the keyboard for you 
negative,the connect doesn stay connected and the bt will lose connection if more than ft away you wrong for this pure trash and you know it 
positive,nothing to dislike got it for my grandson he loves it
positive,work very good my boys love them especially the lights 
neutral,very nice for the price
neutral,i bought this for work had it maybe couple of weeks and it stopped working couldn get it to hold charge 
positive,i think this is the best mouse have used really love it 
positive,my boys loved it way better quality than the ones we purchased from target and broke within month
negative,this product has very low quality sound it sounds weak the microphone has to be turned up and is very low quality it sounds like cb radio 
neutral,it amazing how only good reviews can be posted but when buyers getting scammed out they hard earned money and want to complain about that the review can be posted 
neutral,i loved the design and cool light features but true to the old saying you get what you pay for this mouse was pretty bad it jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button or times before it responds to your request very frustrating to say the least not good buy 
positive,this is my first speaker and love it love the bass especially like to play my lofi music at night when doing homework and the sound quality makes the energy in the room feel so much more calm and relaxing when playing my regular jams on low can still hear the bass when leave the room to go to the other side of the house and it sounds like there party next door putting it in the bathtub while you shower makes the sound expand in way so that makes for an exciting experience this speaker is 
positive,works great with blue tooth
neutral,not good enough sound quality was just ok 
positive,it just okay for me it isn so quiet that would recommend it for quiet office but it quieter than standard keyboards the lighting effects are alright but they go to sleep after only few seconds and there no way to modify that there also no way to see the remaining battery power that ve found yet it was easy to setup but it worth noting that plugging the keyboard in with the charging cable doesn actually connect it to the pc so you still have to have the wireless receiver plugged in taking up an additional usb slot overall the keyboard just doesn impress me ve got half dozen other boards ve tried and ll probably try steel framed quiet mechanical keyboard next 
positive,great sound and battery life it has fallen few times and still is as good as new 
positive,great quality very happy
neutral,doesn stay charged long enough bought and both are the same sometime on down the road llput new rechargeable batteries in both and see if that is the problem they do fit nice to use and runsmooth 
neutral,i bought this mouse so could have something rather than trackpad for college read the manual and did everything to get this mouse to work the softwares that are compatible with this mouse are older have the macos this mouse is only compatible with the macos if you re looking for mouse and you re in the same situation as me this one isn it

neutral,the microphone worked for under an hour randomly just stopped working the first night got it hopefully this was just random dud and getting replacement will be better 
negative,after having this mouse for weeks it stopped working computer doesn recognize the usb and wont pair with it wirelessly this is the replacement for the original one that broke after being dropped short distance no way of contacting the seller very disappointed
neutral,i knew it was too good to be true this would be great mouse but it just stopped working after week have charged it few times prior no issues went to use it today and nothing would avoid and spend few more bucks on something not as cheaply made

neutral,works as advertised would buy again
neutral,i had wireless mouse for over year and found the it was very unstable and track even when not being moved this one is solid as rock 
neutral,very nice
neutral,after day or the mouse would not work at all it was not problem with the connection my computer was able to pick up the bluetooth no problem the mouse itself would not work unless it was plugged into some sort of charger kind of defeats the purpose of wireless mouse 
neutral,didn work very well from the very beginning then it was dropped in water dried out and was even worse 
neutral,we take it every where beach camping bbqs
positive,its good mouse and its different from your standard mouse like the fact it lights up

neutral,i loved this speaker everything about it was amazing went to charge it for the first time today since purchasing it and unfortunately no led flashing no charge ve tried doing factory reset changed charging cables and adapters everything that could and still not charge 
neutral,as lot of other reviewers said the scroll wheel broke have had different usb mouse for years without this problem ll be going back to it the battery life is also very short constantly having to recharge it

positive,i got this headset it is very good the microphone is stereo and works with every game try the audio is the best and the led light don shine in your face great headset overall edit after bit of use one ear is louder than the other
neutral,works every time and have used it in the rain

positive,i do wish that the sleep mode was bit longer as worry that drains the battery life bit the first one received needed to be replaced after month however love this keyboard contacted the seller via their official website not through amazon and they sent me replacement free of charge great customer service use this keyboard about hrs day during the work week and usually charge it every other day it is nice that you can still use it while it is charging did not realize how loud my original office keyboard was until the first one of these died even messaged my coworkers and apologized this keyboard is quieter than my original dell keyboard if had to choose would buy wired keyboard only so didn have to worry about charging but really love this keyboard it easy to adapt love the colors love the layout and lolita with customer service is the best

negative,it looks nice but after using it for few weeks it hasn worked for my online work sometimes it is not so responsive which affects my job performance don know if came across faulty model the usb adapter was not included will try the new one and update my review 
negative,started out and loved this mouse butwithin months it would not hold charge for more tha few hours annoying having to use it plugged in bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable if it was even once day could handle it since like the mouse but can stand charging every few hours so sad 
positive,gave my husband this for his birthday he loves it 
neutral,initially thought it great piece but slowly am struggling to use it as it stops working or goes to sleep for long does not get activated by just simply moving bit has to moved few times or even hit it on pad at time 
neutral,really nice sounding speaker 
neutral,if you are like me and have trouble using usb to usb converters somehow always end up with flaky ones that don maintain connection be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support usb it comes with usb and usb adapter however you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter to use it you cannot use the usb adapter on its own which means have long double adapter sticking out of my computer just waiting to get knocked off had known up front that the usb adapter required the usb adapter to work would not have made this purchase 
neutral,i like it cause don have to spend money on batteries
negative,bought two and both died after week
positive,met all expectations could be little louder but that just how like my music great sound quality also 
negative,i purchased this wireless mouse the first part of may it is now early july and it doesn work anymore have charged it and it still doesn work waste of money

positive,works great
positive,works very well and makes my gaming more enjoyable my kids said about this headset 
negative,had this mouse less than week my kids knocked it off my desk the mouse broke in half and will not snap back together has no durability save your money and buy more reputable brand my prior mouse was dropped dozens of times with no issues will be ordering one from that brand this one is not worth the money 
positive,the title of my post says lot also like how lightweight it is it very responsive to movement but not overly so it as good wireless mouse as ve ever had 
negative,the product lasts about minutes and dies have charged it so many times and it still needs to be plugged in to work even when plugged in it still only lasts another minutes seller is in violation of amazon terms of agreement continually contacting customer private email asking to remove review review is factual and customer will continue to report abuse to amazon through email community help com do not purchase product due to poor quality and unregulated customer service practices 
neutral,product seemed to have been previously opened the plastic bag that is usually covering it was missing there were no manuals included in the box other than that it seems to work alright expected new and properly packagedray
neutral,i bought this mouse because it said it was rechargeable and wouldn have to remember to always have batteries around used it for few days and once the better inside died went to recharge it charged it for hours even though it says the charge time is hours and then went to go use it and it does not work
positive,it is good headset and is good sound quality great for all types of games especially minecraft 
positive, great product love the color and the sound quality is amazing perfect for gaming 
positive,i bought this wireless mouse for my classroom so that could click around on my smartboard without having to walk across the room to my desk each time sounds silly but it saves me lot of instructional time the battery life is great and only charge it about once week even with me forgetting to turn it off before go home each day sleep mode for the win 
positive,i needed wireless keyboard because started using standing desk and the less wires the better chose this one because it has both bluetooth and usb connection options and wanted to be able to switch between my office computer and my personal tabtop the lights are just really nice to look at and they give me bit of cheer every time lookdown at the keyboard it also really quiet which is nice and it types nicely too love that it is easy to take off the key caps and clean the keyboard and there are little drain holes in each key section to clean out the crumbs say does anyone know what the word for all the crumbs and dust and stuff that gets stuck in your keyboard is learned it on tv once and can find it
positive,bought for my husband as far as he has told me and can tell he like them lot he uses them for xbox gaming and we bought them in pinch because our youngest broke his and he has like them so far noise canceling works pretty well if you ask me have to either go up to him and tap him or yell super loud for him to hear me 
negative,i bought this mouse on the th of august and it broke on the st of the same month basically it lasted me for less than month the lights stopped working properly and then the middle part to scroll stopped working it broke do not recommend at all
positive,i really like how sleek this mouse is it extremely functional and the lights add cool futuristic type of vibe making my experience enjoyable every time another neat function is the silent clicker work early mornings so to not wake up my family with the constant clicking of noisy mouse is definitely luxury happy with my purchase 
neutral,this is by far the wosrt head set ve yet to get only two weeks in and absolutely despised it the mic is way to far away from your mouth even with sensitivity all the way up my friends could barely hear me it fixed mic all it can do is go up and down far to stiff feels like vice around my head mic quality is garbage sounds canny and fuzzy honestly you can buy better headsets for the same price not as good but better than this dumpster fire of headset at least it ll make decent target practice
neutral,battery inside the mouse is it not recharable it not working after battery life gone so after months of usage it not working try to change the battery but it very difficult to change battery need to open the top cover and removing batter is not easy even after changed the battery also it not working it looks like one time use only 
neutral,this mouse stopped working after less than months would not recommend
positive,i realized was spending more money on cheaper less effective speakers finally invested in jbl honestly don regret the cost its by far the best speaker ve ever owned bike lot and love to use hammocks at the beach always have it hanging on strap you can hear it from long distance in loud environment do it purchase it 
neutral,i like the color and function of this key board 
neutral,was enjoying the use of the mouse until one day the usb stopped being recognized 
negative,didn realize that there wasn place to put battery in so it always had to be charged after two or three weeks could no longer charge it and could not have it work cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long term or if you spend lot of time on the computer
neutral,this mouse was very dissapointing it was hard to use and finally after couple of months it broke completly 
positive,works great and my students love the color changing lights bought it for my second computer and it has been so helpful would suggest purchasing for yourself it has very smooth texture and slim design always you to take it anywhere it charged quickly so that could use it immediately 
neutral,color is not shiny black cheap plastic material
positive,amazing sound quality
positive,great sound perfect size excellent bass easy access to blue tooth 
neutral,i just got this mouse and wanted to like it but it glitches so much to get it to stop have to turn it off then back on so can continue working will be returning 
positive,nice wireless keyboard bought to replace logitech wireless kb that got banged around for the last couple of years the only minor gripe is wish there was bit more margin around the edge often hit key accidentally when picking it up it is light weight wise and the lighted keypad is great for dark rooms 
neutral,we already owned the smaller version of this speaker and were pleased with the sound quality but were looking for larger louder one after our current speaker broke we are pleased with our purchase 
positive,update seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery they even went as far as sending me here how to remove link purchased this as an upcoming christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now the box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday let me just say am glad that did while the mouse powered on and worked fine with the usb dongle that it requires be plugged in to use decided to test it other feature of being able to charge it while using it everything worked fine until unplugged it once unplugged the micro usb cable from the mouse my entire pc turned off thought maybe it was just fluke so tested it again nothing happened the second time so plugged it back in for little bit to make sure it had full charge on it for her and when unplugged it to re package it it happened again as to say am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective moral of the store don buy cheap products 
positive,the sound is great and totally meets my needs
negative,terrible quality after weeks no good will not recommend buying at all its waste

neutral,headphones came in bag not in box no instructions and no warranty info 
neutral,we received this mouse on june and the return window closed on jul mouse stopped working yesterday without accident or warning so disappointed 
positive,i really like this keyboard and so far it lives up to all of my expectations didn but it for gaming but rather to replace work keyboard that hated to type on enjoy the lighted colors the numeric keypad and the easy set up with little dongle to plug in and you re ready to go also believe that customer service moving forward will be very good 
neutral,it was nice while it lasted unfortunately for me that was less than three months 
neutral,playing games get extreme key lag would not recommend it horrible keyboard tech support is bad too
positive,i got this for my ps pro works great love the colors too make time to read the second half of their email it hilarious please don ask me technical questions had my dad install it and my techie brother got it working along with mouse

neutral,live it
neutral,it broke after only week the little thing in the middle to scroll stopped scrolling got one just like it from walmart for cheaper and it actually bluetooths to the computer 
positive,i am enjoying my speaker
positive,i bought this mouse so that could use it with my macbook unfortunately it barely works have tried for year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop it extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you re better off not using it at all 
positive,mine doesn change color but it slim and works awesome
positive,ctrl shift anything do not work can even mute properly had to map shift to my mouse bit of joke feels cheap just with led to backlight it update after months the windows key stopped working awesome

neutral,i bought this for my nephew and unfortunately he told me that its just all over the place on his chromebook screen doesn go where you need it to go etc
neutral,the keyboard is good and works seamlessly with my apple mac
positive,bought this to replace bose soundlink lost on trip after month of use it no contest the jbl has better sound better battery life and is way louder if you need it great purchase 
neutral,it pretty if it only worked 
positive,there reason these headphones are super cheap because they are it comes with usb and mm plugs so you ve got an overabundance of wires to deal with right off the bat the mic doesn go any lower than the image shows so find myself yelling into the mic to be heard by my team and they tell me the sound quality of the mic isn that good when replace these ll spend more money on higher quality set 
positive,this was such great buy way better than my microsoft mouse soooo happy bought this the light features are really nifty haven really touched it but just so impressed with now smooth it works on surfaces and on the computer in love
positive,i got this mouse on thursday night only charged it for less than minutes not full charge and have been using it for days in row on the red light mode only thought it would run out of power in day or two but is still working nicely the mouse feels comfortable under my palm not too big or too small was ready to be disappointed for the price vs quality but so far so good 
positive,i had been using friend charge and liked it so was looking at the charge and when bought mine the charge is little bit bigger and has better louder sound was very happy with my purchase like that it has aux port and bluetooth capabilities use both features teach zumba class and don have to charge it too often it plenty loud and doesn need to be plugged in for class 
negative,wanted to like this since it was cheaper for wireless keyboard with backlighting with in month or of normal use the letters and numbers wore off that could live with but then the one of the shift keys broke in half and made this unusable again this was with normal office use no gaming no smashing keys 
positive,nice little mouse that lasts while on one charge love not having to replace batteries 
neutral,cute mouse but that about it very flimsy and poor quality feeling like that it rechargeable ve had this for few months now and it stopped working it charged clean clear of debris and on mousepad but still doesn work for more than few seconds waste of money 
negative,very heavy static mic lags terribly unable to use in this case you get what you pay for definitely didn work 
positive,definitely steal at dollars love black friday specials the jbl charge is just the right size to get good audio and still be able to take it on the go have the flip the extreme and now the charge and this charge is my favorite this speaker has pretty long lasting battery while not being huge and unpractical it has power bank feature but to be honest never use it the sound quality is amazing this one has lot more bass compare to the flip 
negative,even didn lat month broken poor quality 
negative,had an older jbl portable speaker the charge is way more expensive and larger than my old one but not any louder was disappointed in that 
positive,i ve been jbl guy since the shows my age guess my experience with jbl has been great they make great speakers that provide the best sound for the buck in my opinion that said there are so many choices today for speakers many more than years ago it can be difficult to choose if you are looking for great little bluetooth speaker with great sound you can do no better than this jbl charge it pairs very easily and quickly with whatever source iphone or ipad in my case the sound is terrific for such small package other blutetooth speakers have tried can compare in sound or reliability use it on my patio and the range and volume for the area are perfect battery seems to be real plus am still running on the first charge it also rated very well by consumer reports you can go wrong with the jbl charge 
positive,awesome buying another one for my smart tvs 
neutral,i really liked it for gaming
negative,after month and half of buying this wireless mouse the piece where you charge it is broken have been extremely careful with it and never dropped it loved it but poor quality don buy it 
positive,i wanted to love this mouse the first one randomly stopped working for no reason it was past the return window so bought another one hoping it was just fluke or that did something wrong even though sure didn bought second one and that one too stopped working randomly after the return window closed won be buying this again
negative,battery life seems to be decent have two of these and both have issues with the dpi randomly changing itself so have to click the button to change it numerous times day every now and then the one use at home doesn connect when turning on the computer have to unplug re plug the dongle do have it plugged into usb switch but seeing as it the only device that encounters this issue don believe the problem is the switch not likely to buy this again it been too frustrating 
positive,i like the size and how easy it is to use
neutral,it works perfectly in my macbook proupdate now it does not work anymore very disappointed
negative,the battery life on this mouse is terrible it lasts maybe day to day and half without recharging also bit small and the grip is slippery would not recommend it to anyone 
positive,recently ve started using my gaming rig for work in cad and other programs so wireless keyboard was necessary obviously rgb adds xp points to every key stroke so this one really caught my eye it is so well built the materials used and battery life are phenomenal purchased mouse keyboard combo here in the amazon before and it was honestly crap within the first minutes the and key would randomly start typing and the right shift key did not work out of the box but this one the klim keyboard is an awesome budget solution take the time to read the material in the box it clearly an awesome company that has put alot of effort into their product very very satisfied im sucker for stickers and they really load you up great experience highly recommend 
positive,it very nice to get something that does what they say it will be do very very impressed
negative,the battery life on it is crap you have to recharge it every few hours it not worth the hassle when it charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn move the cursor the way you move the mouse 
positive,i got the vifa reykjavik and although would say at the mid level the sound quality is identical clear bold and good bass this jbl blows the competition out of the park at the higher volume settings no distortion or loss in quality the speaker is built well and looks great too worth the money think 
positive,i wish it had way to let me know when it needs to be recharged like how quiet it is and the lights are just fun 
neutral,mouse goes dormant after seconds and is extremely glitchy until you turn it off and back on and then it works ok until you stop using it again zero out of five would never buy again
neutral,have not even had the item for three weeks and it has stopped connecting it was going strong for about week and then all of sudden it began to have problems do believe that the mouse is very cheaply made spend few extra dollars and get quality product 
positive,recharges easy to use use it as my travel mouse would recommend it 
neutral,like it
positive,i now have of these and love them when you pair them they saying amazing 
neutral,not too bad feels good however only reason didn give star was that it stated it was quite but in my opinion it not that quite 
positive,great buy and worth the price 
positive,great base sound gets really loud and projects well play daily almost most of the day and battery last almost days before having to change
positive,we love this speaker highly recommend sounds is great and it really is waterproof 
positive,love this speaker excellent quality good price and speedy delivery connection is easy too 
positive,is not the best have try but for the price works very good and is pretty accurate
positive,use this for gaming and its awesome 
positive,this is top line amazing sound long battery life its all good
neutral,nice mouse little too lightweight for my liking battery lasts while track wheel already broke unfortunately 
positive,love is speaker and the sound quality is awesome 
neutral,i bought my mouse few months ago and it was working just fine now the scroll wheel sunk into the mouse and stopped working 
neutral,i was bit too busy with work and school and missed my window to return this item the quality of the mouse and usb plug is just horrible ordered the mouse with urgency to get power point project done for schooland had to run to local discount store to purchase another mouse because the usb piece fell apart and after careful putting it back together the mouse won connect over got about minutes of use fromthis product 
positive,amazing
positive,stopped working after few days of use on brand new laptop will turn on but does not function properly lags however great the first few days 
positive,i would like to say very upset and won get another one like was going to lot of crashes on it
positive,love this jbl waterproof speaker sounds good and looks good if we need another portable speaker we will definitely buy this one again 
negative,the scroll wheel broke after months have food in my fridge that lasted longer not worth it 
neutral,this keyboard was fine for larger hands than mine before buying notice the position of the enter key could not reach it with my pinkie without moving my hand away from the home position 
neutral,stopped working after uses the scrolling wheel isn working update told the company about the issue with my mouse they immediately sent replacement works good lets see if this one lasts
neutral,the only thing didn like about this headset is using it on the ps and there no way to plug in the headset to the controller and plug the usb the the system for the lights 
negative,the usb break apart and could no longer use the cordless mouse ugh
positive,maybe just unlucky given the reviews but they mouse won hold charge simply doesn work also the connectors are flush with each other feels cheap 
negative,unfortunately missed the return window by less than month do lot of panning around for my work with the middle scroll wheel button and the button has issues about half the time where it doesn register that clicked or gets stuck it cute but wouldn buy it again update just wrote this review couple days ago the scroll wheel just broke fully no more intermittent use use it lot but bought it literally two months ago 
positive,the keyboard colors cannot be set to single color but the brightness can be dimmed or turned off the charge only lasts days the keys are very quiet feature was looking for gave stars due to the short battery life 
positive,i just got the item and to be honest didn expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews thought it was relatively good the clicking tends to stick mine and tried doing cps clicks per second test and out of the time clicked the test only registered can say it wasn the tests fault since have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything for everyday work won say recommend it but it enough for that but for gaming do not recommend this since of your clicks won work because the mouse itself isn that great quality 
positive,for someone who listens to bass heavy music this is the perfect speaker can feel the bass with the volume half up 
positive,i only used this mouse for short while but it works very well was able to connect it using the usb transmitter very easily it does what it is supposed to do
negative,i just received this product today and even though there were numerous good reviews unfortunately cannot leave positive one due to the fact that this is useless due to non functional otg plug 
positive,the quality of this headset is great for its price love it would totally recommend for anyone who loves shooting games 
positive,my daughter love the mouse 
neutral,lightweight nice looking wireless fair price but it stopped working after less than year really liked this keyboard but dealing with keyboard that is outputting constant characters to the computer and can imagine how to fix it if turn this on it locks up my computer and tries typing numbers and odd ascii characters shame 
positive,great product
neutral,it worked great for weeks it quiet but it stopped working after the window to return closed it doesn charge anymore money not well spent went back to my old one never fails 
neutral,be very careful about leaving mouse plugged in cord caught fire while using it plugged in 
positive,great sound 
neutral,the on off switch often feels like there is sand in the mouse when moving it it not smooth move like would have expected like the mouse but that roughness is annoying at times 
neutral,works on macbook pro 
positive,this is slim quiet and absolutely love the changing of colors best mouse ve had 
neutral,this was used once thought was my phone will not pair with any device 
neutral,work
neutral,this product was great but it started to no work this past sunday on the th of july got it back on the th of may it doesnt turn on anymore nor does it charge charged it up one time with the charging cord since ive got it
positive,love this mouse so easy to use simple set up 
negative,so basically was testing the removable keycaps to see if the they actually worked so tried it on the space bar and after took it out couldn get it back in and when got it back in it kept falling out idk if this was my fault or the keyboards fault 
neutral,much better than previous mouse devices ve used 
negative,unfortunately it been months and now it useless and unresponsive going to have to get rid of it now and get new one guess you get what you pay for 
negative,microphone failed within week
positive,i like how easy it flow while using it also how it lights up in different colors comfortable in my palm too would recommend
positive,i was super excited for this mouse its so sleek and small it was perfect for me unfortunately it doesn work all that well its super glitchy especially when you turn it on color mode it lags and sometimes it doesn even click on what you re trying to click on its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer 
positive,overall really like the mouse but the scroll button doesn work also was not able to find way to contact the seller to resolve the issue 
positive,i ordered this product on lightening deal it came broken left ear piece did not work mic after using twice did not work either the cord is ultra long made for pc gaming it only lights up with the usb plug in meaning pc gaming not console returned for full refund within week and actually have been getting by with the console stock headset suggest looking elsewhere the deal isn worth you asking for twenty minutes can you hear me now for the second day in row before giving up save yourself the time and go spend an extra whatever to get it done better 
neutral,this was what needed for my backyard get together 
positive,awesome headphones my kids love them 
neutral,this mouse is so hard to use that scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys push the left button times it might place the cursor select the word or do nothing depends on the mouse gods if you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you finally get it where you want and if you type nothing happens this thing is trash buying logitech mouse to replace 
positive,i was extremely disappointed to find out the charging adapter didn come with this speaker it expensive enough you think they include like they did for my charge got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and one of the things he loved about the aesthetics of my charge was the vibrant charger an adapter is something of users will need why omit that great quality but give this star for skimping on the charger 
positive,i like this product and it works really well and there are no problems at all definitely recommend 
neutral,the mouse itself was fine at first worked great and liked the shape and sound but the wheel started to squeak and it always scrolled too fast for my liking and now the mouse won work at all always jumping around the screen spinning lagging or unresponsive really annoying when trying to play games it does this when the battery is getting low too not fan it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on and now it won even read on my mousepad at all it has to be on the desktop to make it work even poorly 
positive,amazing tool for my job that required lot of documentation 
positive,got this for great price the size is perfect for my hands and is easy setup 
neutral,this mouse is ok except for the battery life it didn make it through full hr day of work before shutting off and needing to be charged again 
neutral,excelente
positive,worked great 
positive,perfect size for awesome sound quality bring it with me when want to play it loud 
positive,i received the keyboard with defective dongle had talk to the customer service about it and they were very nice and helpful received new one few weeks later and the new one doesnt work either looked up how to sync it with the keyboard and after many attempts it just wont work sad because the keyboard looks cool and would very much like to use it maybe it just my luck of getting defective receivers 
positive,i really love how easy it is to setup this mouse nothing to download just plug and play have been looking for slim mouse that works on my mac and windows machine that doesn need batteries or mousepad and this definitely fits the bill the lights are cute fun addition but are subtle enough to not be distraction while using and don seem to drain the battery too much overall think it great for anyone looking for something easy to use 
positive,it is nice mouse and liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook however the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable the adapter seems flimsy and cheap luckily had an adapter and the mouse now works fine if you are buying this for mac would recommend investing in good adapter 
neutral,haven had it long usb adapter is already broken so my mouse is currently unusable on my macbook mouse is decent but seems to not hold charge very long when was using it 
positive,son loves playing with his friends and enjoys the sound quality of the headset he uses it on ps 
positive,really cool keyboard the rainbow lights look awesome like that they turn off on automatically while in use to avoid draining battery faster can speak to how long it stays charged or with what kind of use my keyboard use can be pretty sporadic as it just for personal use and not heavy gaming or regular work use the charging cable is short for my liking prefer to plug it into an adapter and not the computer for efficient charging the feel of the keys is nice they press easily but not too easily typing is quiet the keyboard is very lightweight which is nice for someone like me who moves it to charge it and also put it away when not in use it also fairly compact for full keyboard so it nice it doesn take up much space 
neutral,the little wheel broke within the nd day
neutral,so got this for sitting by the fire at night with the family now take it everywhere need great sound ve even used in place of my bose speaker rate this 
positive,it is ok for beginner headset or for your kid who plays and he probably gonna break it after couple weeks but other than that you pretty much get what you pay for it made out of cheap material and feels like it anyone who plays lot it probably not what your looking for 
neutral,excelente
positive,awesome love it the lights are beautiful and the prefect brightness 
neutral,very nice product little did know jbl was coming out with charge so soon 
positive,great product so far cool lights also not battery operated charged with usb cord 
positive,absolutely love it it sometimes take me few tries to have it connected to my ps the sound is clear it so easy to use and it feels great on my head 
neutral,stopped working after two months
positive,love it you should get one great battery life ve had it for months and use it everyday and have only charged it twice 
positive,it pink and super light love it ton
positive,bought these as christmas gift for my boyfriend mind you he tends to have expensive taste when it comes to technology after putting them on he scolded me because he figured they must ve costed one to two hundred dollars lol thanks amazon great clarity of sound and noise cancellation months later they still work great 
negative,yeah know it relatively cheap but didn expect it to be that feeble the sound and recording quality is pretty bad might as well just talk through laptop open mic even with software noise suppression the listening quality is pretty awful worthless for music listening the mic itself is has poor response and acquisition then there the usb which is only used to light the headset leds up really just shabby 
negative,after months of somewhat daily usage just for checking emails occasionally or something fast the middle wheel stopped working making it pain in my ass to use would recommend staying clear since it only has day warranty 
neutral,worked for four months but then stopped seems like it stopped recharging 
neutral,not good don waste your money
positive,bought these for my son and he loves them he says they re really comfortable and the sound quality is good 
positive,mine came in the wrong color but regardless they are still pretty good headphones guess you just have to talk loud into them kinda
positive,i just got this two days ago if this won work after charging it two nights in row sure it garbage 
positive,nd time is the charm st one wouldn turn on if not plugged in even when plugged in turned on and paired no sound comes from it it was paperweight requested replacement and it works great 
positive, pleasantly surprised had to hook them straight to the tv with the adapter they sent because have an xbox but my kid is loving it and didn have to pay fortune pretty decent for the price very loud the squeaking noises were the buttons on my xbox controller 
positive,i dislike that now want to buy another one however like that want to buy another one awesome speaker 
neutral,beyond what expected bought more
positive,i really like this mouse it works great and is really cool looking love the alternating color lights around it and since it rechargeable you don have to worry about short battery life work on my computer hours week and find only need to charge it every weeks so periodically just plug it into my laptop when go to sleep so it is always good to go 
negative,i would not recommend this item bought this for my daughter for school it quit working after two weeks was going to buy another one but decided to wait to see how this one would work so glad didn buy another one when put it on the charger it does not work would not recommend this item at all if you buy it you re wasting your money we liked it because the light so tried to put it onto another charger and it did not work either so don know what the problem is would not recommend this do not buy it here an update keep receiving emails from the seller wanted me to change my review don think that how it should work because the item did not work they want me to change my review to good review or they want me to delete it and pay me money for it so now this is the second email have received the first email they wanted to pay me the second email they want to pay me when you buy something online your post to do review of your item so do not recommend this item
positive,i use this exclusively for my raspberry pis and it works great love that the dongle sits under the mouse itself makes it easy to bring with me everywhere 
positive,ergonomic and fits my hand well pretty when charged mine doesn hold charge well it only lasts couple hours at most 
positive,it quiet and esthetically pleasing 
positive,easy light inexpensive quiet and perfect for my new mac laptop 
positive,we bought these to replace my son headphones that the mute broke on within months he loves them and said the sound quality is great and they feel really comfortable very stylish and he ll look cool to all his friends and classmates with his light up headphones 
positive,my son loves it hooked up to xbox easily works great 
negative,this mouse stops working even when fully charged and the light on the bottom is on this did not start happening until weeks after the return window ended would not recommend buying this for these reasons it was waste of money 
positive,excellent quality you expect from jbl 
positive,new outcome had issues with my st keyboard reached out to the seller and they helped me troubleshoot my device until we figured it needed to be replaced they gladly sent me new keyboard which is now working as expected will definitely recommend this brand old review this keyboard is rechargable and does not have an option fir batteries it worked for month and half it doesnt hold charge mine diesn work at all wasted and now need to buy another keyboard 
positive,my son loves them for gaming no complaints from him only have to get louder so that he can hear me if he playing with them on lol 
neutral,it is almost perfect escept the assembly gap is big some dust dirt tiny food waste will go in easily
neutral,i just got this mouse and doesnt even turn on after charging the usb plug does not work as well this just isnt good buy if was you would go for different one cause its waste of money so just save it and look for different one
positive,the light display makes enjoy it and it fits well
neutral,good quality
positive,it solid and well built and functions well the only issue is the short cord for the lights 
neutral,worked great at first but now the right click button does nothing am back to my track pad avoid this device cheap components
positive,love this mouse it works great has fun led light feature feels good in the hand and is easy to use 
positive,the mouse is ergonomically comfortable and like the cool lights however difficult to enjoy these features when the mouse doesn work the first one had defective left click button ordered replacement because really wanted to like this mouse got the replacement and less than two weeks later the scroll wheel stopped working 
neutral,despite there only being feet between my computer the usb adapter and this keyboard the unit disconnects constantly it okay for rts games but is literally unplayable with anything that requires constant use of the keyboard do not buy this keyboard 
positive,a friend recommended this pair to us as something that will last longer than just few months after year still uses this nearly every day and works well 
positive,great quality
positive,so far so good looks cool and feels good would buy again
positive,bought this for gaming and love them
positive,when first got the item the color looked off ordered the blue but fairly positive based on the images was sent mint green liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for bit because it was so quiet however after only week and half the mouse wheel stopped working could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so opened it to investigate and it looked like there was small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn work anymore liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the rgb lights it bothered me but that didn affect the function wish this had worked better 
positive,overall great product really like the feature of connecting another to it take this on bike rides and my buddy who has one shares music on both speakers as we ride it has one speaker but sounds great in small to medium size rooms this thing holds it charge and great feature is that it also battery pack for cell phones 
positive,purchased this mouse for my son to use for his school work and he loves it the colors are fun and it moves smoothly he also loves that it doesn make clicking sound would recommend 
positive,plugged right into my ps controller and works exceptionally well if being honest these are just as good as the pair was gifted that broke which is why purchased these and eventually when these wear out will be repurchasing them can beat the price for the great quality 
positive,awesome works great 
neutral,i ve had this less than year it been wonderful but is starting to get skippy glitchy to where it unusable it shame it nice colorful quiet mouse but evidently not made very well 
positive,nice low silhouette and quiet action does what is expected of mouse and is good looking to boot obviously cannot judge it ergonomic qualities from such short term of usage but it appears to be no strain at all on my wrist and fingers holds charge well the only caveat might mention is that the dongle is bit too short for if you re using while charging but that is minor issue well pleased with this mouse 
negative,my son used these for minutes and the kept cutting out these are awful 
neutral,beautiful keyboard automatically recognised by windows the charge port is type this charging wire is accompanied with the package update it can be charged and check the ammeter only current flow in to the keyboard need to connect the charging cable when use the keyboard 
neutral,only had the item for bit over month and started having issues with the keyword would not working would plug it in to charge and it wouldworks for awhile then start having issues would not type would pull the usb connector out of my computer and put back in and it would work for short time dealt with this for couple of days but then no longer could tolerate the keyboard not working went out and bought me different keyboard work from home and have to have reliable keyboard 
neutral,just got the headset havent used it yet
positive,great
positive,i ve had this mouse for almost weeks now and and loved it until just yesterday the scroll wheel developed loud grinding popping sound every time you use it will definitely be sending this junk back and get something else 
neutral,the mouse stopped taking charge from the charger after months
neutral,first one died within week and half bit the company was great about getting me quick replacement
neutral,very good
neutral,i am enjoying my colorful mouse however my mouse connected to the computer of someone else while in use during class have also been having trouble connecting to my personal computer when am by myself 
positive,product worked great and has good sound quality so far used mostly with ps and it connected easy and setup was straight forward 
positive,quality is great nothing bad it fits perfect sounds perfect 
positive,the sound quality of this headset is amazing plugged it in to my pc and there is no crackling noises and when talk friends and family there is no change or crackling in my voice 
positive,works great well worth the price bought for my son and he loves it
neutral,micro usb would nt connect or the keyboard never worked in the first place figured for near said and done that it would be reliable product was wrong 
positive,really comfortable great sound quality from both ends and it can be used for lot of devices 
positive,the mouse is great the install was very easy just plug it in and it is ready to use love the changing lights on the mouse if anyone wants led wireless mouse this is the mouse to purchase 
neutral,cheap quality 
neutral,when this gets low on battery it starts to flicker out where the mouse will stop and start sending information so your clicks won register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen the added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about min to an hour of use and then it acts like that for the next several hours it nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long it shame because love how stylized it is but it basically unusable 
positive,really like the quietness of the clicks flatter than most mice took little bit of getting used to but fine now will be easy to travel with very responsive charges by usb and lasts for several days no need to have extra batteries led lights are fun but hard to see in bright light looking at the screen when using the mouse who doesn so don really see the lights that much 
neutral,i like it
positive,great product
positive,i think you guys did very good job of building this keyboard it really matches my computer tower have at home keep up the good work 
positive,i wanted cheapish head set for my bf at the time and saw this and figured ok why not the cord is super long so you can sit anywhere in the room you re playing in and have good reach on wire it sounds good and works good 
positive,great product recommended 
positive,i had an issue with the first pair but the return process was fast and easy plan to order more for my nieces and nephews highly recommended item arrived fast and as described
positive,i love this and it works great you can adjust the sound and mute your mic very easily the only down side is that you need usb port to make it light up it really does not matter if it lighted up or not but play on ps and only have remote don have pc to plug the usb into to make it light up but overall love it 
positive,my son uses it for his nintendo switch loves it 
neutral,i really liked this small mouse for my laptop it worked fairly well but the tracking wheel soon developed squeak that rendered it unusable 
positive,outstanding product and customer service thanks 
negative,the keyboard constantly lags and has issues with bluetooth even when connect directly via usb have this lag issue sometimes the keyboard spazzes out while working on something that requires extreme precision if you are using this keyboard for coding or sending important emails then be warned that you might have connectivity issues 
neutral,i not too happy with this led mouse when it goes on sleep mode have to literally turn it off and turn it back on to boot up again thinking of returning it and get full refund on this product 
positive,i was pretty happy with this keyboard bit louder than wanted but good just couple weeks ago maybe months after purchase the keyboard cannot send typing commands to any computers it can turn on light up etc have tired multiple cables direct connection or rf usb connection etc nothing works would suggest spending your money elsewhere 
negative,i enjoyed using the mouse while it lasted but after months of light use the scroll wheel collapsed mouse is still responsive but scrolling no longer works which makes it practically useless to me 
neutral,first of all not worth the money you pay for not comfortable for gaming and broken buttons since had wired dell keyboard for gaming amazing stuff used years and still was in good shape 
positive,best bluetooth speaker ever 
neutral,great sound and very lite but days to somewhat fully charge and this is the second one ve had jbl needs to think what kind of batteries they are using 
positive,ok product for price point wish battery lasted longer the keys are little awkward have to press harder than normal keyboard but for the price happy love it in the dark wish you could change the rainbow effect to solid color but happy overall use it for work so cannot give full review for gaming but did like the fact no software needed to be installed 
neutral,my only problem with this headset is that have to have my computer volume up to use them also have to turn the platform volume up to even then everything seems little muted still 
positive,love the sleek look works great noise canceling is there but it isn quite as good as more high end headset however it isn an issue in our household and the headset is excellent for the price 
positive,good overall product for the money have had these headphones for one year now and they still work great the sound is good and the noise cancellation works pretty well they are mostly used with nintendo switch lite and they even work well with that happy with the product and would buy again 
positive,has great sound good mic and decent noise cancellation overall great 
positive,i bought this keyboard about year ago initially the light up feature is very cool and made my work from home months more enjoyable at one point when rearranging my office space lost the wireless receiver was very disappointed because it had been working great so reached out to the company directly to see if could buy new receiver as the keyboard was still working fine they told me the wireless receiver was on backorder but they would replace it for free was very pleased with that solution however few months went by and they told me they wouldn be able to get me replacement part so they sent me brand new keyboard highly recommend this product and this company 
neutral,liked the colors and style east set up but after about weeks of use the scroller stopped working and fell off track only used it few times out of those weeks 
positive,looking at the amazing price and the sheer number of reviews thought these would be good but was disappointed they look really really cheap and feel that way too mine had some dried glue or subtance from the factory on them they were ok in comfort but had to draw the line with sound quality if you ve ever owned pair of turtle beach headphones these sound so muffled there was no range to the sound at all just mids and lows it made it hard to be competitive in warzone because you couldn really make out some crucial distinct sounds like the direction of footsteps or gunfire probably should have known better given the price according to other reviews this headset is pretty decent but guess they just aren for me 
neutral,i may have gotten defective product but the left and right click buttons rub together when clicking so you need to press harder than you normally would to select and without the click noise it hard to tell if you actually did select something ordered different one from another company and will be returning this one 
neutral,quiet precise 
neutral,don bother doesn work
neutral,product broke after one month of using 
positive,headphones are comfortable
neutral,the sound quality is good for gaming
neutral,broke immediately
neutral,this came out of the box not working description and reviews are very misleading very cheap and glitchy 
positive,i use this in class and at home and there is not any noise when you are clicking the buttons which is nice when we are quietly working on things would highly recommend the color changing is also great 
neutral,it broke after weeks 
negative,the sound quality is good but keep accidentally pressing the scroll down on the sound also for my pc the mic is absolutely terrible no one can hear me at all for pc get different headset 
neutral,it is exactly what wanted
positive,this headset worked well until just outside the return window worked great when it wasn broken don trust the stars 
neutral,after one charge it stopped charging anymore
negative,i was really interested in this because it markets itself as quiet and let me tell you if never needed to use the space bar it would be very very quiet however as most modern languages call for spaces between words this keyboard is incredibly loud if you so much as look at the space bar it clacks it probably the only thing you can hear from my desk as every other key is so silent the space bar ruins the rest of the key board no connectivity issues the time out is fine battery is fine keys work great but gosh darn is it loud don know if it going to stop bothering me at some point trying to give it time but may have to just scrap this keyboard and try different brand say spend your money elsewhere as this is beyond annoying 
positive,great use
neutral,i like speaker but there is no charger 
positive,nice mouse the battery lasts along time before needing recharged and like that do not have to use mousepad with it as it works great even without one 
positive,great product highly recommend
neutral,everything is perfect except the audio when talking on mic get lot of complaints on quality of sound
neutral,didn work from the minute opened it don waste your money 
positive,this mouse is great 
neutral,only holds charge for minutes 
neutral,quit working after month not worth the money paid 
positive,sounds good got money worth
positive,great sound and easy to carry wherever you want to go
positive,the wife needed new mouse found this one she said she liked it ordered it she loves it very sleek works perfectly usb charging instead of batteries awesome 
positive,you get fantastic sound quality for pretty good price hands down the best ve ever spent 
neutral,a very reasonably priced cordless rechargeable mouse with button control with scroll wheel which is my preference rather than the macbookair track pad or the mac mouse for the desktop mac 
neutral,came quickly easy to set up delivery person put in spot close to door and knocked to let me know it was there door bell not working and he was wearing his mask
positive,awesome product excellent gift and they have many colors
negative,bought or two month before christmas just wrapped it and put it in the closet my son opened them christmas day and was excited but when he went to use them they didn work and it was to far past to return them was very disappointed 
positive,it fits my hand and the light show is cool 
negative,i should ve listened others review read but thought it might be some specific situation but my the bluetooth don work at all and now have to trouble myself with all the returning work 
positive,the song volume is acceptable but is not like the ads or the pay rewinding people show pd thx of god buy in discount price
neutral,nice look to it
neutral, 
neutral,it has the charging cable but where is the plug for the outlet 
neutral,it sounds good
positive,i like how it even though its not as flexible around the band that it doesn feel like giant hunk of weight on my head the sound feels pretty good and it comes with multiple ports to use it 
positive,very nice mouse it super quiet exactly what wanted the lights are nice and change on their own haven had to charge it yet but it gets ton of time off the initial charge 
positive,this speaker is very worth it had it in our family room and it sounded like we had surround sound highly recommend this speaker over any other speaker very good base as well 
positive,fun little mouse doesn feel overly sturdy but cute lites are fun 
positive,i really like this mouse pretty catchy color rose gold and it maneuvers so gentle and smoothly 
positive,the headphones fit comfortably the headphones are not lout though even with everything turned up they aren as loud as they could be would recommend these for kids for that alone otherwise they aren bad as replacement for bucks they also can use usb or single port the wire is split and even comes with splitter for the single port total of different ways to hook it up it is made of cheap plastic so it might be for everyone but it not bad option if you need headset 
positive,love the red it won get dirty easily purchased white before that and realized the plastic on the sides and bottom will turn yellow over time so ended up returning the white 
neutral,n a
positive,my son is super happy now it game time 
neutral,i really like this wireless mouse love the changing colors and the rose gold is gorgeous my only complaint is the the usb to connect to your laptop is very hard to get out always need some sort of tool to get it out ergonomically since this review had me rate it it perhaps little too slim but don game and light laptop user so doesn bother me that much otherwise would buy again and put up with the pesky usb when travel 
neutral,i bought this mouse back in july to use with my laptop when was in class this would equate to few hours each week the mouse stopped working after about month and charged it overnight the blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all such bummer because really liked everything about it 
negative,absolute garbage listen to the negative reviews and the ones saying the company is spamming them begging to remove their posts the lights are haywire with no pattern randomly switching off and on dpi is not adjustable pretty sure that lie feels like the lowest grade plastic ve ever felt does not track lights will give you seizure without doubt this company is scamming you 
negative,sound quality is not that great don be fooled it cheap plastic is fragile mic broke off 
positive,works great
positive,update received my free headset for leaving comment and review and its awesome would definitely recommend doing so if you want free headset it looks good and easy to use no complications and comes with adapter for pc really like them so far only down fall is when using for playstation or any aux plug the headset does not light up only lights when using usb 
neutral,works
positive,just so you know loved the simple amazon wireless mouse but our cats kept knocking it off the table and the battery cover would come off over and over stupid cats but now with this mouse the battery is rechargeable the cats can tear it apart and it has cool lights on it the function is good the price was low everything is solid so recommend it 
negative,dissatisfied darn thing stopped working
neutral,the only thing do not like is having to charge it with usb sometimes trying to use it and it dead so connect to computer and can use it works best with longer cord that don have 
positive,a well engineered mouse with long battery life good design and cutting edge wireless connectivity very easy to set up and use recommended 
positive,works very well thanks 
neutral,mouse wheel is already squeaking when rolled after barely months of use 
positive,i honestly love this product the keys are very comfortable to use and the ergonomics of the keyboard are conducive for gaming and typing my keyboard did experience some issues with the left side shift key after about years of heavy use so reached out to customer support and was mailed replacement in about days after contacting them the customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful overall this is an excellent product and excellent company will absolutely purchase any pc hardware from klim in the future 
positive,lights only work if usb cord is connected therefore it can be used with the computer but lights won work with xbox noice cancellation doesn work well at all but my son is happy with them overall 
positive,it really nice bright soft key sound works while charging super happy
neutral,the there is only speaker facing the front and its reall small battery life is not hr maybe on lowest setting with an aux use this at work on volume when using bluetooth will last only hr
positive,my husband absolutely fell in love with them they are so comfortable for him and work perfect 
positive,best gaming headset for people on budget 
positive,love these high qualit for affordable price 
positive,i actually bought two large outdoor speakers for my husband for christmas for our lanai and he wanted to return them for one of these we have second and we connected both to our tv and honestly it created really nice surround sound effect without wires great product also bought some for my nieces and nephews last christmas and they were hit 
positive,we just purchased these headphones yesterday received prompt next day delivery the packaging is nice headphones look great easy use sound is good has good base noise cancelling is also good will be using them for gaming today 
neutral,like the rechargeable battery part the most bought this for my gaming grandson and he is happy with it will soon be buying one for me to replace my aging keyboard liked wireless keyboards but hated replacing batteries 
positive,this is great headset for starters 
neutral,once fully discharged couldn get it to work again even after charging for multiple hours multiple times
neutral,headline says it all 
positive,this gaming headset is really good for the price and it super comfortable the audio quality was better than expected overall if you re looking for good priced headset this is good choice 
positive,they are nice fit the only thing that could make them better if is the microphone could rotate to go both ways like to wear the mic on my right side 
neutral,my new speaker was received day early and works perfectly couldnt be more happier 
neutral,the mouse looks great feels great but didn get more than few hours out of it before it died left it plugged in for several hours but it doesn stay on anymore despite several recharge attempts it just doesn turn on anymore 
positive,i love this mouse it is sleek and easy to use the led color lights gives it cool look 
neutral,worked well for few months now scroll doesn work
positive,this is my first headset and it definitely seems to get the job done my voice carries through the mic and the sound is great 
positive,i love this keyboard work in large office from typing all day so needed something comfortable and quiet this has been working perfect for me and would defiantly recommend 
negative,it won charge at all two weeks after bought it and it already useless the blue light turns off like it charged but it totally dead tried different cables and it just doesn work
positive,my son has requested this headset and loves that he can control the volume on the cord control the sound quality is really good too he has told me

neutral,i purchased this mouse on prime day received mouse that does not work no matter what try about to send back for refund please don waste your time purchasing this item wish could relate to the good reviews am so disappointed 
neutral,its good
neutral,these headphones work fantastically my son uses them for online school and the teacher was having hard time hearing him with all the noise in the background now with these headphones they bother can hear each other no problem 
negative,my year old uses for gaming poor sound and eventually sound goes out waste of money sorry going to send back and exchange for better quality headphones
positive,puts out incredible sound quality durable and actually very vey water proof full dunk on may occasions every other blue tooth speaker sounds like crap compared to this one can and won live without it 
positive,just received it and love it already great sounds 
neutral,doesn work at all am tired of charging it and nothing happens wasted my money 
neutral,the charge does not last full day
neutral,the scroller doesn work mouse feels generic
neutral,it light and the texture is nice but there are few flaws the mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table the mouse is small which is nice for portability but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after while the battery charge is good and the lights aren too harsh but by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn maintain constant mouse button press so if you have to hold and drag something it will just randomly unclick even though you still have the button pressed tested this lot and it always without fail stops holding down on the computer this is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons perhaps just received faulty mouse but for the price it hard to complain too much 
positive,my year old autistic son loves these headphones and tried them out as well just to make sure he wasn just saying he likes them just to appease me they re comfortable and not too loud even on the nintendo switch can still hear outside moises but it does not make me regret these headphones 
positive,i love this mouse got the teal and used it for the first time today in love 
neutral,garbage headphones ve tried pairs and the mic quality is terrible bought better ones and had zero issues 
neutral,rd jbl bluetooth speaker ve owned over the years solid quality and sound battery is good but not going to wow with longevity 
neutral,it has been about months and this keyboard completely stopped working this lights are broken they don stay on and the light fr caps lock doesn turn on not to mention it won type whatsoever anymore do not recommend this keyboard 
neutral,usb adaptor is not working but that why bought this mouse 
positive,this mouse is amazing very comfortable smooth and aesthetically pleasing charge lasts forever 
positive,great product and very happy with my purchase quiet buttons when pressed and love the different color lights 
neutral,has weird echo 
negative,i didnt like the dim features im using razer keyboard now and its alot brighter than this aloso hated the feature where it would turn off after few seconds interferred big time with my gaming and cant see where this can be gaming keyboard as such games as skyrim and fallout require you to make last minute decisions as for regular keyboard for regular things its good but gaming naw its waste of money sorry guys its flop 
neutral,have had multiple jbl speakers never disappointed 
neutral,after only months it will no longer hold charge
positive,this is great headset sound quality is great both on the headset and on the other end of the microphone comfortable padding on the band across the top of my head and on the ear cuffs as well great purchase 
neutral,while the mouse was ok at the beginning it is now lagging after about months of use ve had to order new mouse already to replace this one 
positive,i was tired of buying little cheap speakers that weren worth the money didn last very long and had terrible sound so decided to spend lot more for quality speaker got this for use by the pool it linked very easily to my phone the sound is great with plenty of bass can use it for several hours few days in row without worrying about the battery running down it seems to charge back up fairly fast too so glad spent the money on this totally pleased with my purchase 
positive,ok speaker great battery life sound got distorted when it was turned up full mine quit working all together little after months 
neutral,stopped working after days 
neutral,serves its purpose for everyday use teacher who uses their laptop daily worked great for about months and then the middle wheel stopped working 
positive,honestly couldn be happier with it hadn heard of the company before but the receipt of this keyboard made me an instant fan quality product at fair price and they seem to be sincere in putting customer service first and it came with metal stickers one immediately went on my pc will buy more of their products update after couple of years the charging port broke but the keyboard was still under warranty and they sent me brand new one absolutely wonderful customer service still experience 
positive,works great and connects instantly wish the lights were bit brighter and had an option to let them stay on they turn off after minute or so ve had this for months now and some of the buttons stopped working maybe have faulty one but prior to this it was doing it job great for price but it is cheap 
positive,won charge
neutral,the mouse worked great in the initial few weeks but then started having lag in movement and slowly it became so slow in movement that the click also stopped working of the time disappointed as bought this item after reading numerous positive reviews 
neutral,started off good about weeks in it wouldn move fully charged 
neutral,in theory this is good keyboard but impractical practical use it just not it dies way too often and am video editor cannot have those kinds of problems time is money
positive,the mouse clic is silent it feels very ergonomic at hand the battery lasts pretty good my daughter loves itthe lights are so nice specially at night with the room lights offgive it try
positive,it looks awesome and is really quiet only had it for short time but love it 
neutral,junk
neutral,this is not working
positive,my son has been using since xmas great sound and comfortable he will be going wireless on the next pair good starter headphones durable and has not broke
neutral,i have been using this mouse for about month it had been working perfectly only use it occassionally throughout the day after about month it stopped working while it was on the color changing mode it still works while on the regular red light mode but now not the color changing mode 
positive,update from stars to was having trouble with the jbl connect app but now got it figured out do not have more than connected devices at one time otherwise the app will not work once the app worked could now turn off the audio prompt which was annoying when especially you don want to disturb anyone now the start up and volume either reached maximum or minimum does not give me the unwanted feedback nice note my experience with this speaker was less than hrs also it didn been through water test just so you guys know only single sound driver could tell sound was coming from more from the right side when had the speaker feet away from me and that my preferred use that was already little unpleasant next issue was the jbl connect app didn work at all it couldn find the speaker what lastly and most importantly used my speaker lot listening to audio book before go to bed when this speaker volume was down to say maybe or so could hear random breaking up background noise coming off it that was my last draw and unfortunately had to return it what would like to is that the light indicator can be controlled via the app but since couldn use the app wasn sure if the light indicator could be off or dim somehow it is way too bright and unnecessary also if possible led indicator to show the level of the current volume it does not have to permanently turned on but fade away after second or two that will be way better jbl jbl oh no 
positive,so far great love the look and the sound is definitely recommend 
neutral,regular use
positive,and she loved it
positive,it was perfectly fine
neutral,one of the sides of the headset doesnt have sound lol
neutral,it is very good in sound quality noise cancellation
positive,i really love my mouse have no issues at all thinking about ordering my sister one she saw mines and instantly fell in love with it order you one you won regret it 
positive,good gaming mouse use it to play game 
positive,i love this mouse so glad went wireless makes my desk so much more organized 
negative,i would be as bothered by the fact the charge switched to mono if they would ve at least centered the damn speaker blows my mind the majority of people that buy this will probably think the thing is broken because of that no way would pay full price for the charge when the is stereo much cheaper and likely sounds better 
neutral,my return date closed days ago and the mouse has stopped working completely 
negative,i ve had this speaker for less than year and have for the most part absolutely loved it use it in my car for long road trips and when the speakers in my laptop blew out started using it every day for podcasts etc from my laptop unfortunately the battery is just not holding charge it flashes red indicating low battery and then reads fully charged when plug it in after less than minute totally inaccurate as it reverts to flashing red again in about minutes very frustrating and ridiculously hard to change the battery myself don own the right tools so now in the market for new speaker 
neutral,i have used this mouse for two weeks now and it is now not working properly have charged it multiple times thinking maybe it was lacking because it didn charge all the way that wasn the issue the curser is lagging and am unable to use the center piece to scroll through pages couldn figure out how to message the seller to see what their next steps would be 
neutral,easy to travel with
neutral,says it works with xbox in the headline and maybe somewhere buried in the description says it needs an adaptor returning immediately 
positive,i have of these speakers for my ebike they sound good and they are durable ve dropped mine several times and even in the rain they still work beautifully no bs thx 
neutral,it disconnects at times requiring you to unplug the usb connection and reconnect 
neutral,i play it hours day at work and charge it once week 
neutral,you could think it decent mouse for the price you paid but in reality it is an uncomfortable mouse and barely works the only good thing about this mouse is that it comes with usb to usb adapter which comes in handy 
neutral,this mouse stopped working one month in despite being charged and taken to my company tech desk to be looked at to see if was the problem 
neutral,so easy to hold just plug in the wireless receiver and turn on the power switch on the bottom of the mouse and start using no batteries to install because the mouse is wireless 
neutral,very glitch curser tracking is not smooth at all silent buttons are almost too sensitive and frequently click when not meaning to do so threw out this item after only days 
neutral,very ergonomic soft click like that it recharges and doesn need batteries can plug it in overnight if need to but the charge lasts long time it is comfy
positive,sound quality is absolutely great for its size it can really fill space sometimes leave it playing in my room and go outside and it almost sounds like have whole mini hi fi stereo system in there the bass is very good but can also be tremendous if you position it right place it in corner where it can bounce the sound off the walls etc and prepare to be amazed it slightly bigger than the charge but probably the price you pay for bigger sound it really hasn affected the portability for me just throw it in my backpack and go it pretty durable haven dropped it but had paint droplets splash on it and was able to wipe it off with damp cloth perfectly and also sand etc comes out of it easily after day at the beach my only gripe is the single speaker that is contained in the housing is off to one side so sometimes if you re right in front of the speaker close enough to it you may hear bias towards the left side other than that totally excellent speaker never really charged my phone on it beyond few minutes but it works and the battery life feels super long especially if you re not playing it constantly honestly just excited now waiting to see how jbl is going to improve on this in future models 
positive,loved this mouse and the battery last pretty long
neutral,this is the second time purchase this mouse in matter of few months and the second one is already not working at all charged it and all and nothing have the rose gold one can you guys please send new one or refund me like the color matches my laptop well but refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months 
neutral,love the mouse and it quick connectivity to the computer not happy the scroll bottom quit working 
negative,lasted less than year died completely while in the middle of work has cheaper keyboard last long that this one 
positive,fast shipping great product
negative,i had this mouse for about week use it for work and once it died used the cable it came with to charge it left it plugged in for few hours and now it wont turn on at all it flashes red and turns off waste of money
neutral,it was easy to install and worked the first time 
positive,i bought this headset for my son for christmas and it now may and he hasn broken them yet so that win he seems to like them lot and says they re comfy and the sound is pretty clear in them

neutral,it just stopped working out of nowhere mad missed my return date 
neutral,purchased on june never charge over night only charge mouse when needed and turn off after each use however month and half later mouse is no longer charging very short life span 
neutral,i really like how they feel they don compress my head or make my ears sore
negative,the scroll wheel broke after months have food in my fridge that lasted longer not worth it 
positive,there great headset
positive,i use this everyday in my postal truck carry it in the rain charge it once week with one or two out of five battery life lights left sound quality is excellent and pairs to my phone easily use it to hours day definitely one of the best portable speakers ve owned
positive,i like the sound quality lot and great bass my only complaint is the bulkiness of the headphones sadly you can change the color of the led lights you can only move the mic up and down and not side to side don feel the noise cancellation though its better than expected for headphones 
positive, this product is great for ps highly recommended 
positive,very good quality for decent price will probably buy another as gift 
negative,tried on multiple surface and no matter what do the pointer is erratic it also never goes into sleep mode if you fail to turn it off you will run through the battery in day awful tried to click on the seller name in an effort to contact them directly but it was grayed out very disappointed 
negative,bad
neutral,it doesn stay charged for very long
positive,love the sound quality really happy with this purchase there enough evidence and reviews on youtube to show how good these speakers are 
neutral,beware this mouse did not hold up it wouldn charge correctly after week had to return 
neutral,the clicker won work any more because the rolling piece broke
neutral,well enough
neutral,when got it was excited for the usb charging and the cool lights but this mouse has been lot of trouble it will lose connection easily and ll have to click or times sometimes before actually clicking on what want 
neutral,failed after three month of use from jan to apr charging is not possible it is too late to exchange do not waste money 
neutral,this needs to charge very often wish knew that before purchasing 
neutral,i ve had this for few weeks and it already useless it won charge when connected horrible 
positive,i purchased pair for my boyfriend and he is literally in love he says the sound quality is really good the mic the color everything really feel this was great purchase with great price would highly recommend this product 
neutral,dislikes european layout of keys definitely not american made like the branding suggests likes usb charging soft texture of the keys lightweight but sturdy silence 
negative,wish hadn missed the return window on this one this mouse does not have range of meters as stated it has difficulty tracking at just meter or even couple of feet away this was supposed to replace mouse from another seller that also had trouble with it turned out to be the same exact mouse it disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products would recommend spending little more money on mouse from reputable brand 
positive,great sound good value
positive,i like lot the quality and the sound and really amazing when play online the others gamers can hear me good and clearly recommend this product 
neutral,broke after two months usage 
positive,good for gaming or playing music and not bad sound 
positive,awesome speaker the base is great 
neutral,so far the mouse charges connects tracks scrolls and left clicks fine and the led lights are nice the right click doesn work which is something use often at work have to use the right click on the mouse pad on my laptop which is inconvenient

positive,very good product sound quality is amazing
positive,i love these headphones they re perfect for my ps thanks 
positive,sooooooo good noise canceling is perfect 
neutral,finally the wireless rechargeable mouse works as advertised small handy recharging is easy 
positive,i love it just like the description 
negative,everything is perfect but the whole point while got this was because its wireless but wireless is useless if theres no reception after feets after year or so can remember it stopped working all it does now is just flashing light back and forth when try to type something in 
neutral,very cool lighting as seen in the photos and it soft touch mouse no loud clicks here 
positive,perfect speaker 
neutral,it broke after only week the little thing in the middle to scroll stopped scrolling got one just like it from walmart for cheaper and it actually bluetooths to the computer 
neutral,these noise canceling headphones do not have hardware and software that is actually known as noise canceling in them it merely refers to the fact that the headphones go over your ears and do minimal job of blocking outside noise these headphones do play noise and it does have microphone but if you re looking for something that has actual noise canceling tech in it look elsewhere 
neutral,it only worked for month do not recommend 
positive,love everything about it
positive,i have the klim wireless keyboard and like it quite bit my work space is rather limited and find it handy to pick up the keyboard and move it out of the way while am multi tasking it also handy that the keyboard lights up as my eyes get tired and often forget to put my glasses on so the light up keys are helpful do wish the on off switch was in handier place however however am not gamer so don know how it might rate in that category otherwise like the keyboard for all other reasons weight size price and overall usage 
positive,great for the cost 
neutral,i read the reviews and ordered two one for home one for office they both worked great for about weeks started having trouble with the charge not lasting and then by the time my return window expired they were both worthless can still plug in and the lights are pretty perhaps very weak night light that is what the star is for the pretty lights 
negative, star just for the misleading title maybe the public is too ignorant to realize that waterproof and water resistant are not even the same discussion 
neutral,good headset for the price 
positive,purchased for my year old daughter she absolutely loves it sleek design great for small desks and true to color highly recommend 
neutral, liked the product while it lasted the few months it did it just stopped working out the blue 
neutral,i had initially given this stars but it stopped charging after couple of weeks asked for replacement and received different version of the one initially had that never held charge returning both of them for refund 
neutral,very good for price 
positive,like use it for music production it serves it purpose to elevate the mood in room while creating music compositions etc 
positive,i bought for my years old son the size is just right for him nice works he is comfortable with online classes at school am pleased with this purchase

positive,awesome speaker 
positive,my son loves these uses them everyday great find 
neutral,very good product 
positive,comfortable headset and solid upgrade from my previous 
negative,this is total waste of money as it stopped working after two weeks so dissappointed with this product 
positive,inexpensive but the quality matches those of way more expensive mouses also this mouse has led lights which is very nice will definitely be recommending this to my friends 
positive,great mouse love it
neutral,i got the jbl speaker in the box with the charging cord but not the battery pack as seen on the jbl box
neutral,i gave up my mouse for this new mouse because it didn work on the other laptop to make them happy it would just stop working ordered replacement on another review amazon refunded my money 
neutral,i got this mouse for work it works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can be used with battery it only usb charger so the only down side of this if work with it for days will need to charge it or it will die on and have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it it unfortunately not for me and don like how it doesn have battery or dies fast 
positive,jusk ok good quality
positive,i gave this to my wife as christmas gift the sound is huge and the battery lasts really long time she loves it 
negative,the wire was weak the part near the plug broke apart after months it is still functional but the wire is visibly damaged you can see the metal wire inside breaking apart the product description claims for it to have noise cancellation but that is lie every time use the headphones can still hear outside noise do not waste your money 
positive,this product came on time as expected am satisfied with my purchase as it is well worth the money 
positive,not sure for games but its really comfortable and pretty cool with the colors
positive,the keyboard linked up to my laptop immediately and turned on the backlit color which was cool however the buttons and the keys themselves are very flimsy doesn feel like quality keyboard but it does look nice 
positive,the colors are dang cool it doesn work with the xbox one series not an adapter wrote the seller and they took this very seriously and addressed my issues asap thank you so much sadly it just was not compatible with my xbox one giving them stars bc of the awesome customer service would buy from them again no problem thank you 
negative,i ordered this on today is and the keyboard is no longer charging when plug the keyboard in it charges for seconds and then stops this is regardless of whether the keyboard is on or off 
neutral,good buy 
neutral,mouse wheel doesn work
neutral,this product is trash bought two for my kids neither even work properly one you can hear sound other set the person can hear you what waste 
positive,keys don always work right love the lighting effect though
neutral,i bought this mouse because it said it was rechargeable and wouldn have to remember to always have batteries around used it for few days and once the better inside died went to recharge it charged it for hours even though it says the charge time is hours and then went to go use it and it does not work
positive,these are amazing and recommend them 
positive,great for ps 
negative,sounds great but the only reason bought it was because of the advertised battery life of hours it lasts hours charged out of the box for the whole night took it to work and turned on at am it played music until pm when it died very disappointed am returning it for my money back 
neutral,no problem
neutral,bluetooth keyboard
neutral,see above
positive,amazing sound and great portability 
positive,my son needed new pair of gaming headphones and these were steal great price for great quality my son loves them and said they re better than his last pair 
positive,item came fast easy to set up and use love that it is rechargeable and you don have to worry about constantly replacing the batteries use this at work plug it in at night to charge and it lasts all day while work with no issues would recommend this item 
neutral,to loud definitely not quiet 
positive,wow what great keyboard that makes typing fun keys are well spaced if you use shortcuts frequently this will really help does not feel cheap at all the construction is top notch and the key sound is an elegant clicky pump sound as far as can tell rgb color pattern is the only color choice but many ways to tune the back lighting effect to your taste super happy with the purchase 
positive,great product took up north and we were able to sync three speakers together sound is wonderful 
positive,i got them for my son birthday he love them
neutral,very easy to use
positive,so far so great no loud clicks and feels good in hand 
neutral,the mouse is cute and light but it doesn consistently work throughout the day it will be working and then all of sudden it will be non responsive and has to be turned off and back on to get it to work again would not recommend 
positive,i am very pleased with bengoo was charged twice for this product and they kindly helped me and refunded the extra charge would absolutely purchase again my son is enjoying this head set 
neutral,easy to use
neutral,it nice mouse however they sent me the wrong color wanted black not pink
neutral,bought this to use for my mac already on big sur turns out the mouse is only compatible with x
neutral,the wheel was broken the second day used it
positive,fast response on keys charges fast using it three weeks on one charge so far save some money with this purchase very happy rayraythejetplane
neutral,not fan have had better for cheaper 
neutral,worked fine for about months than died this is the nd jbl speaker that did this for mei won be buying any more jbl products shoddy workmanship lemon 
positive,great mouse very fast and smooth was skeptical at the price being so cheap but wow fantastic item would definitely buy again in fact am getting second one for my son for school 
positive,i like that they fit around the ear and man they sound amazing 
positive,slim design comfortable for the wrist 
positive,honestly still better speaker than the black round harmon kardon got from sprint 
positive,i use it for work and it amazing glides very nice am sure it would be perfect for gaming 
neutral,might just me my pc or xbox but the mic was very quiet for everyone on the discord call and xbox party
positive,i got the purple ones for when playing ps was excited for them to light up but they don they only light up for pc other than that they re good for gaming pretty comfortable expected them to light up no matter what console is used return them to find better but might as well keep them 
neutral,this was replacement for another expensive illuminated keyboard which got wet findillumination and wireless operation to be very handy the fact that it is water proof or even water resistant is bonus it is not completely silent keyboard but there is very little sound key action is not quite as firm as mechanical keyboard but not squishy battery life remains to be seen but it is casually used daily for at least hours with no issues and only charged it once in week an charge indicator led would be plus so far it has performed very well and met expectations 
neutral,this is the fifth item purchased on prime day that is as good as trash cheaply made poor quality not easily adjustable definitely not noise cancelling 
positive,feels nice works well looks good
neutral,this my second purchase of this product so when need to charge one have the other one to use holds charge very long time and no cords 
neutral,the mouse itself is beautiful the lights make it better rating this because it worked good for the first few days but after that noticed that it randomly stops working even after it fully charged have to move the switch to off and back on for it to work sometimes it still lags or cuts off and literally have to keep it on charge for it to work continuously don think it going into sleep mode because it does it sometimes while actively using the mouse 
positive,this barely ever needs to be charged for me have online schooling so use the mouse lot and only have to charge it every once and while its very pretty and good for the price makes no sound when clicked which is great 
neutral,i like the look and feel of this mouse however the fact that you have to charge it is kind of pain it doesn make it through full work day so usually by the end of thebday have to plug in my wired mouse 
neutral,i have now purchased two jbl bluetooth speakers wrote to jbl about the first one not holding charge for even half of the advertised time never heard back my second purchase does not hold charge for half the time advertised either my jbl flip purchased from amazon in july have only ever held hour charge it supposed to hold charge for hours reluctantly purchased another one but figured my flip was dud have friends that say their charges hold charges for long time jbl charge from amazon in april my charge only hold charge for about hours it supposed to hold charge up to hours the fact that these speakers do not hold charger for as long as they are supposed defeats the purpose can use them on trips or in the woods like should be able to as they need to be charged frequently bring my charge outside when garden and it dies before my day is over and have to connect it to power source was wondering why my charge didn sound as good or was as loud as some had heard before and now realize it because it not built the same as the charge 
neutral,they were decently sounding with good amount of noise cancellation however these were more intended for pc because there is two cords one for sound and one for the lights the cord is too short to connect it to the ps also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gaming 
neutral,excelente producto
neutral,you have to have input for usb for his mouse to work it does not connect to tablets 
positive,they are great
positive,so really like it like you can shut of the lights if you want it is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it very easy for person who has laptop

neutral,size is good
negative,liked the keyboard but as have large hands was not good fit for me 
positive,amazing headset for the money great quality 
positive,on the outside this headset looks great and fits comfortably not sure if mine is defective or just had something come loose in shipping but it doesn quite work right the microphone works fine and the left earpiece works fine the rights side is where the problem is have to move the cord just right to hear out of it if this was headset say it fine but for feel like should at least be able to hear out of both sides without having to do yoga position to get it to work properly overall say it not bad but also not great do with that what you will 
positive,bought this one for my daughter because am so happy with mine we use it for gaming together from different rooms and have no problems at all noise cancellation is okay but not considering getting another one for my wife 
positive,i ve only had this for few months but not only is it really cool looking it responsive and comfortable to use

neutral,i purchased this in july and it worked perfectly it now ass backwards you have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor if let go of the button it does nothing its completely off track the led only works when it charging before it worked whenever it was on the last switch on the bottom of the mouse 
positive,i definitely love the sound on these headphones and they re very comfortable which is ideal if you spend hours gaming overall very good quality and good price 
negative,the right click button stopped working within few weeks troubleshot by reboot control panel settings and even recharge overnight no luck 
positive,great buy
positive,the wired mouse ve been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises love the convenience of this one being wireless so it easy to use with my desktop or laptop it super easy to install and while the buttons aren completely silent they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse the colorful leds are fun but it not feature ll be using lot so far ve had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all certainly recommend this mouse at this price point 
positive,i love how loud it is how it adjustable for your ears it bigger than what use to you can say it was great upgrade 
positive,ease of installing and very super cool looking at my laptop 
negative,amazon increasingly started to provide no name no sn no model description poor quality merchandise which fail to operate out of the box they may or may not function 
neutral,i haven used the sleep mode and don do gaming
negative,i live in florida and was searching for loud speaker that my family can hear through all the wind ocean noise we are avid beach people and have ugobe through many beach speakers living previously in hawai texas south carolina etc pros sleek lookcolor optionsloud soundwaterproofheavy enough to withstand steong beach windconsdoesn show battery life in percentagewill not beep or alert you when the battery is about to die the music will start to cut out guess that is your notice honestly still am not set on this speaker might return it my little speaker beeped when it was going to die for over this speaker should show detailed battery life beep when low otherwise good little speaker 
positive,the speaker is amazing not that expensive and lot of powder 
positive,love it 
neutral,i have been musician my entire life and this thing sounds like utter garbage compared similar jbl speakers the one speaker is just horrible go to store and try for yourself even the old link is better sounding 
positive,i originally ordered the white version but when got it realized it was see through asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version ordered or what all the white mouses look like they re all white according to the shop because raised concern they were so kind to ship different color to me free of charge didn even have to return the original 
neutral,nice the only problem ve noticed so far is it really hard to click the scroll middle button it just really stiff 
positive,great keyboard highly recommend 
positive,i used this product as gaming headset and is by far the best headset have bought 
positive,for the price realized could have gotten something lot better it cheaply made glitches even with full charge got the white one and wish would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it it does the job still all considering just think it value is overestimated 
neutral,at full volume the in game sound is still not the loudest for the price it good headset that will last while 
positive,sounds really great so far so good 
negative,wish hadn missed the return window on this one this mouse does not have range of meters as stated it has difficulty tracking at just meter or even couple of feet away this was supposed to replace mouse from another seller that also had trouble with it turned out to be the same exact mouse it disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products would recommend spending little more money on mouse from reputable brand 
negative,this headset died after less than month of regular use no loud music only used for gaming voice chat they just randomly died total junk save your money buy something else 
positive,very loud an steady great bass an it the sizes of an football but like it
neutral,i bought this mouse in february it uit working and you relpaced it now the new one quit 
neutral,the mic stopped working and charging after few weeks
neutral, by far my favorite headset 
positive,this is the best wireless keyboard ve ever bought know ppl complain about slow response of the keyboard but if you change the settings for it you ll get better results my boys play games on my laptop and this keyboard responds quickly to all the commands required to play the games amazing keyboard for an affordable price love the colors love the fact you can change the intensity of the glow 
negative,functional mouse but it is hard to click with fingers extra effort needed which is not good probably won buy this again 
positive,i picked this keyboard since it one of the few out there that still have the old school design with big tall enter button instead of the wide one was very pleasantly surprised with how nice typing feels and how quiet it is these were the main requirements had and happy to say it ticks all boxes only wished it operated with replaceable batteries as those tend to last longer in my experience instead it has you charging the built in battery with cable which lasts about weeks before needing to recharge it but that was my fault for not paying attention to the description other than that noticed the space key is slightly louder than the rest of the keys but really this is just nit picking and not noticeable when typing normally overall really very happy with my purchase 
neutral,it worked fine and then stop bought two hope the other one doesn died too
positive,surprisingly great headset for great price nice surprise 
positive,awesome product sound quality amazing
neutral,thinnest mouse have ever seen 
positive,my wife got me this headset and omfg the amount of trouble they caused in the span on gaming session it started before gaming as well at first could either get to hear or have the mic kinda work if you could call it could only pick up me tapping on it working and my wife fiddled with setting plugged it it different ways like in the speaker jack like my last set though my xbox controller and directly into my pc with and without the splitter finally my computer noticed the headset in the xbox controller oh boi will give it another chance and have hour gaming sesh with my friends yeah about thatspent an hour trying to fix the headset again either no one could hear me was super quite or was breaking up so bad it was pointless to talk with this headset basically spent the remainder time yelling over to my wife headset she was also playing with us just for people to hear me well awesome my voice is now shot for the night coool oh and my ears omg is this headset uncomfortable to my ears don think have ever had set that didn completely cup my ears spoiler alert these don was complaining about the ear pain these were causing me before we even started playing and before the hour of trying to fix my mic the sound was nice and they look kinda cool sending them back and sticking with turtle beach 
neutral,everything is great but the back space is sticky key sometimes it works sometimes it doesn 
positive,update reorganized the living room and it seems that the wireless signal improved lot corners seem problematic for the dongle with good direct line of sight it works well really like the look and the fact that the enter key is large iso layout the key between and left shift is missing tho not sure whether it should be there anyway packing is nice and adds emotional value the usb charging cable is little too short the bad news is if it is not close enough to the dongle it fails lot after it goes to sleep it sometimes wakes up unresponsive you get key double presses and lost keystrokes randomly copying pasting and cutting can be chore because you don know if the keyboard sent the ctrl or ctrl appropriately if you figure out how to keep steady link between the keyboard and transmitter you re all good wish there was way to know how much battery is left if you re ok spending more on keyboard go for the pro stuff if you re on budget it good pick dear klim guys like you try improving connectivity for solid reliable wireless performance and showing battery usage
positive,after doing ample research think jbl is the way to go for bluetooth speakers the sound quality is great battery life is long and it great addition to any beach trip or backyard bbq after reading lot of reviews settled on the charge bc it seemed to have the most positive feedback and least amount of glitches 
positive,i have used this for days realistically less bc it only used it won hold charge now and dies before lunch despite being plugged up over night 
positive,wasn able to link to another speaker don know why sounds good but wish the volume was little more sensitive we keep it low in the office but it fine line between to loud or to quiet like it though 
positive,used them all summer in stereo operation with the jbl app works well sounds great 
neutral,i had to update my review because initially gave it only one star it abruptly stopped working after months but realized the following day that it was actually problem with my mac or wifi instead of the mouse when attempted to print my mac was also not finding my printer ooops so shut down my mac my printer my wifi and when turned everything back on all was well not sure which thing caused the problem but happily my mouse is working fine again no one contacted me to change my review was not offered anything as business owner understand how important reviews are so when something turns out differently we need to update our review it the right thing to do

positive,really nice headset the only note ve got is if you are using this for ps the usb placement to power up the lights on the headset is right next to the audio jack like connected away not very practical and you have to put usb extension on it if you want to power up the lights could care less about the lights so ve got high marks for this great noise cancellation sound is crisp and headset is very comfortable 
positive,i brought his product for my son he enjoys it does provide lot of isolation hearing when he very engaged 
negative,scroll wheel completely stopped working after two months the power cord also stopped charging the mouse after few weeks of use complete waste of money

positive,the sound quality was lot better than expected and my son loved the lights
positive,i really like this this is replacement for broken battery operated one used to have love that this can charge from usb port and not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time it got cool lights around the side and it works well on lot of surfaces use my laptop in recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine ve also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results it does take just second when the laptop boots up to locate but that minimal the usb wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all all in all ve been very happy with the quality and efficiency this was great purchase 
neutral,it was nice for the week then it stopped working

positive,very easy setup nice and stylish great product for the price 
positive,it has good sound and the mic works great usually others can hear every little thing in my house but with this one it really dialed down to just my voice so there is active noise canceling which takes some extra circuitry and passive noise canceling which is just the shape of the thing making it really just noise isolating take your hands and cup them over your ears now your hands are passive noise canceling just like these headphones it world of difference from an active noise canceling still good headset just know what you re getting

neutral,just what wanted battery life tbd
positive,amazing little mouse
neutral,ergonomically find it to be too short and bit uncomfortable bought it as travel mouse so could over look that except that it barely works every time have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again 
positive,great quality for the price

neutral,it nice not to have to worry about replacing batteries 
positive,this worked great for months then it just stopped working it fully charged but won work tryed changing adapter and still doesn work not an expensive mouse but not worth anything if it doesn work 
positive,after looking at the reviews of this particular led mouse decided to give it try received it and so far am very pleased with how it performs it is extremely lightweight and the led lights make it so much more enjoyable to use highly recommended 
neutral,excelente
neutral,these headphones were comfortable had great quality sound and was convenient what didn like however is that you cannot change the cable on the headset after couple of months the wire that connects to the audio jack was so weak it stops working would keep using these headphones if it wasn for the fact that you cannot ever change the cable if it gets damaged 
negative,this was the worst mouse ve bought it goes dead very fast and then you have to charge it all night for it to die fast again would not recommend this mouse

positive,i ve had these for little over four years now and have had no problems with them at all mic is great sound is great volume control is easy there are blue lights in the headset that light up if you plug the usb portion in for power they are everything need want in headset edit ve used these exclusively with playstation xbox consoles over the past years with no problems but recently ve started using them for pc gaming as well and for some reason the mic does not work with pc sound coming through the headphones is still fine though 
neutral,was very hard to click not worth 
positive,works awesome have been looking for speaker for my crew at work friend has the bigger one and loved it but did not need one so big so another friend that works at mobile snap storied the charge and had to get it love it 
negative,my mouse has stop working already had the mouse for two months and already it has stop working this was waste of money 
positive,really happy with the purchase considering the money paid the sound has been crystal clear remember this is not usd headphone so lets not consider this with bose or sony products also it comes with the required accessories so you can use this with the desktop the build is really good and it holds very good 
neutral, if you have big hands don recommend you buying this also with the lighting really dislike it if you look at the video it goes through the mouse and you can see all the the stuff inside very disappointed overall it good and sturdy mouse just thought they could ve worked on the exterior more 
positive,this thing is so smooth and so awesome highly recommend 
neutral,stays charged
neutral,broke early on
neutral,i ve gone through or of these in less than year they are not durable in my teenagers hands sure they are not the most gentle with them either buy them because they are cheap and we just need to get through the school year have switched brands recently to see if it them or this brand that just breaks it always the scrollers that break

positive,the sound quality is great use them out at our condo pool 
neutral,overall good set of headphones they are slightly tight for the wearer so he avoids them when he has headache 
positive,i like that this mouse has sleek look to it slim ergonomic good quality not cheap looking like the color options available very easy set up ve been using it for couple of weeks now and it works great have not used it for gaming great price and will likely buy my next mouse for different computer have from the same place 
positive,i bought this for my niece birthday so she can talk to her friends while she games she absolutely loves it
positive,the ear cups fit really good have not had chance to use for skype or other mic features so can say on that it does come with mic speaker split connector which it does say you need to order led are bright 
neutral,real like this mouse it stays charged for long time 
positive,i just recently got into using mouse and keyboard for fps games such as cod and this is my first keyboard overall good keyboard keys are firm but press easy some buttons are shaped different than usual but that makes it easier to use them ie the enter button sweet color display goes into sleep mode after about minutes of not use to conserve battery but shoots right on as soon as you hit button over good keyboard works with xbox one
positive,works great easy to use worth it
positive,i knew what was getting myself into reading the bad reviews it stops working in few weeks usually hedge my bets especially when product has so many reviews that end up with star rating alas lost this bet the scroll function key feature look for in buying mice stopped responding after few weeks fluke should buy scratcher if so because bought two one white one black and they both failed around the same time wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way though as seeing many other reviews doing the same thing but people being bribed for star if replaced quite genius actually if you get angry customers to review it promotes product engagement but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting star review if this indeed is the case bravo brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for subpar product 
positive,this mouse is great as an everyday tool because of its ergonomics and functionability 
positive,the sound quality is great would recommend for anyone looking for an affordable gaming headset 
neutral,not bad would rather have purchased apple

neutral,lights doesn stay on
positive,this was gift for my daughter she loves it but she doesn really use it for gaming 
neutral,bring to the beach
neutral,these stop working after short while bought they all have been returned spend couple bucks more and buy different unit
positive,awesome headset for the price cool led lights good sound and mic definitely recommend this to anyone 
neutral,sound quality is trash mic didn even work
neutral,decent mouse looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the cheapness of the mouse cursor tracking is the biggest issue the cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the dts button doesn seem to do anything for controlling this 
positive, great design overall let see how long this mouse lasts me love that the noise clicking is very quiet also love the glossed turquoise color no problem connecting to the bluetooth on my computer 
positive,keyboard is great functions as promised the follow up email was truly helpful as many of us do not read the instructions the key instructions were in the email and made the keyboard even more functional one improvement that feel would be nice being able to change the color of the lighting mainly to all one color 
positive,great speaker sound and bass is perfect clear use it on my boat so its water proof and holds change all day for me on the water really enjoy it 
positive,i had gotten these headphones for my son for when he is on the playstation or his laptop and he enjoys it very much he has not found dislike to the headphones since getting them they came in quality condition and are excellent this product deserves stars because of how amazing these headphones are 
neutral,doesn hold charge for even full day 
positive,the klim keyboard had good reviews so thought give it shot glad did ve been looking for deal on backlit keyboard but everything found was plus for gaming board really like this for the smaller frame yet having key included the multicolor backlighting is nice although the colors are fixed and only allow adjustment for pulse on or off and dimming don use keyboard for gaming much so really can comment on that the bottom line is if you are looking for an inexpensive keyboard that looks good has backlighting decent battery life and has smaller footprint for full size board then this is it 
positive,love it great keyboard at great price don hesitate to buy it 
neutral,easy to use
negative,i ordered of these for our new macbook computers we got for christmasmy granddaughters broke after only couple of uses mine finally tried setting up last week after being on holiday and it doesn even work return windows are closed so they will make its way to trashdonnot but this items they are cheap and waste

positive,i like it it very comfy and the ease of access is wonderful the sound is wonderful 
positive,i really liked this mouse the design is sleek can use the little attachment for my mac to make it compatible and it maneuvered well however after only few weeks of use the top plastic portion that splits down the middle to accommodate left and right clicking just literally spit apart and now my mouse is not functional very disappointed in the quality and durability of this item however gave it stars for the awesome performance prior to it breaking

negative,the speaker skips so much that you can listen to the music extremely frustrating am major jbl fan so this is heartbreaking 
negative,the description says that it is adapter for macbook air this is not true you have to plug adapter into laptop and then the usb wireless tab into the adapter had know had to use an adapter would not have bought this can not return as need it now very disappointed

positive,my little brother got these for his birthday and absolutely loves them he takes em with him everywhere lol haven actually played with em but the one time had them on they seemed pretty comfortable as for noise canceling the boy can hear damn thing when he playing his games so be willing to wager they do good job at that 
positive,i like very easy to install and the color change on the mouse
positive,it really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in way the batter also seems to last quite few days if you turn it off when it not in use it also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle the silent clicking is what really gets me

positive,great backup headsets
positive,this headset works great it cancels out background sound and the mic sounds great 
neutral,holds charge for days 
neutral,battery last forever accidently left it on over the weekend and still didn need to charge it until tuesday it did take some getting used to the power save function you need to click to wake it up 
positive,my first one had about weeks and the wheel broke loose and it would not work received replacement in two days and it perfect can blame them for manufacturing issue love my pink mouse highly recommend it use it hours day days week 
positive,loved it love the colors 
negative,this is really ball to use it does exactly what the description says change colors slowly and continuously also it has two modes color change or battery saving single color but the battery lasts for hours and it is as easy to recharge as cellphone in fact you can plug it into usb outlet on your laptop or whatever and it will charge in no time the only problem have with it is that occasionally the cursor on my laptop will jump from one side of the screen to the other or from bottom to top etc have no idea why that happens and it can be annoying which is why stars instead of 
positive,i have had this mouse for almost months and use it at least hours day haven been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging but in the time have had it have only had to charge it times and was able to continue to use it while charging do use it for gaming but my games don require fast and accurate like rpg etc so can say yes it does gaming for me but unsure about speed games pros it slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it not ergonomically built and it fits nicely in my carry case the colors are soothing you have options for either standard usb or usb for chargingthe cons the on off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole you need nails or stylus to turn it on the sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it skates over the pad good shake usually gets it right all in all it priced reasonably for what you get update like everyone else just few days past the day return cutoff my mouse also died no power wouldn charge dead contacted the manufacturer mototo inc and they said they have year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out new one 
positive,this is great little mouse for someone like me that has smaller hands and some nerve issues as well it is light not bulky and works so smoothly would highly recommend it and will purchase another for friend 
positive,excellent detailed sound for video games say if you have an average vizio tv like me these headphones are better quality experience very comfy they really surround my ears completely the mic arm is very tight stable the tangle free chord feels like cloth

neutral,i will never order this product again had to return it and ask for my money back headphones came to me not working at all so also waiting for my refund
neutral,its nice
positive,great noise canceling headphones 
positive,i professional musician and spend lot of time listening to music with critical ear didn expect much from the jbl but was surprised at the sound quality pumped out by this compact unit connected to my phone effortlessly good bass tones and definition in the highs gets pretty loud too highly recommend for when you want music away from your home base 
neutral,this mouse is seriously cool it comfy quiet click and has light show 
negative,horrible quality the wheel stopped working only after few hours it is very light and feels very cheap 
positive,i read the other reviews and it seems great fully charge mine and it last few hours if the charge lasted this would be good mouse have to rate mine one 
positive,the keys are very quiet and the led add nice touch to the office however for typing occasionally do look at the keyboard to ensure of my hand placement is correct or to look at the key pad to punch numbers the downside is that the keys are pretty dark themselves so tough to see at glance overall happy with my purchase 
positive,the mouse is sleek and cool looking especially with the the colors but after few months it won hold charge and the input for the charge cable is loose nd won try charge unless it held in certain angle nd pushed it with force
neutral,it nice laptop but won say it for hardcore gamers the backlight stays rainbow colored and will turn on after few seconds of non use which makes it difficult to use it in the dark have to hit the spacebar just to turn the lights back on and that annoying the wireless feature is nice and ve had no real issues other than the light problem 
neutral,i bought this because it looked small and exactly what was looking for when received it turned it on and it lit up got excited to only put it to charge and it completely stopped lighting up tried everything to no avail it either fried during charging or just quit working either way returned it and got my money back 
positive,i can say enough good things about this speaker after months of heavy use at home and outdoors it still looks and sounds like new it loud enough to use at parties yet small enough to carry around the battery seems to last forever listen to it all day and use it to charge my phone only have to charge my speaker once week 
positive,my husband and now have jbl speakers and love them we have huge home and our business on the property too so we use them every where and any where we are easy to connect great sound quality and wide blue tooth connection we can connect to our computer lap top tablet phone tv and even in our car they have great color selection too highly recommend this product 
positive,great for the price
positive,i should have got this long time ago now feel like can keep up with my gaming group without driving my partner crazy super comfortable and stylish definitely grateful to have received this as gift 
neutral,after turning it off it powers back on by itself it will not stay off power cycles all night tried resetting and still does it 
neutral,had headset one day only mike stopped working sending back to amazon not happy with purchase
negative,the mouse never turned on complete waste of money not happy
negative,this product is very disappointing and the advertising for it is suspect while it states that it is compatible with the nintendo switch and box one systems the microphone is not compatible with either unless you pay and extra for an adapter to make the microphone work the worst thing though is the return window you have like weeks to return it then you are stuck with it spent two weeks trying to get it to work and figuring out whether it was worth it to pay for the adapter now am stuck with these useless things very very disappointing it is definitely worth it to pay more money for better product that is actually compatible with the systems it says it is compatible with 
positive,highly recommend silent click is great you have the option to turn off the color changing mode 
positive,easy to use have mouse pad and moves pretty good over it and perfect fit in my hands the quality of the product is good the size is good fit to carry in hand or with laptop bag 
neutral,there is delay when typing 
neutral,i have had this few months and loved it but now the roller to scroll is not working 
positive,works great with the nintendo switch son loves it so far came within day of ordering 
negative,i ordered the track ball broken in the silver one within days the right click broke on the rose gold one within days only use them for light use no gaming and they are not sturdy at all they were both difficult to charge
positive,great headset
positive,this comes exactly as described it works great and is easy to recharge
positive,i bought this and originally gave it perfect review because the sound quality is great but the actual quality is not after less than days it quit charging and quit working called amazon who offered refund when purchased it it was they told me they would refund me and then could order new one and now they are when it worked it works great but it just did not last long on amazon did not really do any favors with replacing sure the reason they did not replace it is because the price has gone up or the sale is over asked for replacement and they told me no they gave me refund and told me to re order so that they instead so sure they can make more money not happy and very unimpressed do not recommend buying the speaker through amazon because amazon seems to be the crappy one here go buy it at costco who will honor the same price and replace it 
positive,the cord has already broken but before that they were great gave them to my preteen son for christmas and he seemed to love them 
neutral,does not do that great and the mic doesn really pickup your voice well you have to talk really loud checked all my settings 
positive,i liked the ergonomics the most very easy to hold the mouse my palm did not pain inspite of heavy usage it restarts quickly from sleep mode consumes less power perfect buy value for the money highly recommend 
neutral, this may not be professional headset but if your not professional this is the right headset for you 
neutral,the mouse worked fine for maybe or hours with my pc laptop tried it on another laptop and desktop with same result the cursor moves intermittently and is not useable fully charged the mouse and tried with and without usb adaptor and no change 
neutral,bought it on black friday the sound is little bit blurry that might be due to waterproof function sound format only supports sbc which is the most disappointed thing overall would rank it above average considering the promotional price on black friday and suitable for those who like bring their speaker for outdoor activities 
positive,i love that can charge it and not have to keep going through batteries its better than the last mouse had will upgrade my keyboard when it goes out 
positive,not only does it sound awesome but the one thing like about it is when you leave the range of the bluetooth and come back it turns back on just an awesome unit
negative,the mouse had come in greasy package and had already been opened before opened it myself it had brown and black stains all over the top of the mouse and was of horrible quality would not recommend it to anyone looking for mouse 
positive,i love
positive,great
positive,great price headset for what it is 
positive,i loved the mouse and it worked great for the first couple of weeks and then the scroll wheel is no longer working 
neutral,worked only until couldn return it anymore 
positive,works great would recommend it to everyone 
negative,it worked the two minutes it stayed charged left it charging for an hour and used it total of two minutes before it completely died again left it charging hours and it did the same thing waste of money 
neutral,good set for noise cancellation when gaming 
positive,amazing sound and battery life also worth buying several as they link up
neutral,its pretty it ergonomic its rechargeable no batteries but and its big but the charge wears off in about day and it takes to hours to recharge and you have to keep track of the charging cord the charge dissipates without warning this is very annoying glad kept my old mouse not sure keeping this perhaps its matter of habitually charging it overnight like phone guess glad not gamer having it quit on me at crucial time in the game would be disaster 
positive,i needed slim responsive mouse and got exactly what needed bought for work and connected with no issues would definitely recommend for anyone looking for reliable mouse customer service too 
neutral,battery lasted less than minutes after charging for hours connected to my laptop just fine 
positive,got this set for my son who has been using it for school work chatting with friends and gaming on his computer we have been very happy with the headset it has worked flawlessly with no issues whatsoever sound quality is great and the headset has served its various purposes very well so far would definitely recommend 
neutral,been trying this for over month now and have only used it handful of times because the charge barely last hours at most even after full charge save your money
positive,great product
positive,its amazing
neutral,good quality sound system 
positive,greatest sound and durable
positive,these speakers are amazing and nothing short of that highly recommend them to anyone even considering them we have in our house and sync them together regularly to make the whole house able to hear clearly the music we stream 
neutral,it stopped working
positive,i bought one to use outdoor around my pool and loved it so much got second second one to use in stereo mode battery life is incredible and lasted over week with or hour swims the fact that they are weather resistant is big plus as mine have both been splashed quite bit put under the diving board on end to keep it out of direct sunlight and heat and the other one is at the opposite end of the pool under pool chair these have bass crisp highs and they will really crank up the volume but don annoy my neighbors takes less than minutes to turn on and connect to eithet my phone or tablet the tablet option is nice on stand if want to watch football game while taking swim star highly recommended 
positive,the mouse looks nice however the instructions are in chinese struggled with connecting but once figured it out its working awesome so far will do an update in few months so far so good 
positive,it great as am able to hear my buddies and don have to hear my sisters talking mostly to play on my ps 
neutral,works well 
positive,i wish would have gotten one earlier love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier
positive,good looking and works great love the changing lights 
positive,just not impressed at all these are supposed to be almost head phones not on sale but they definitely are not no base and could hear everything that was going on around me am returning them 
positive,love it
positive,awesome keyboard makes pc gaming much more better experience
neutral,loved the mouse until the scroll wheel stopped working opened it up and the wheel has broken always used with care wouldn suggest buying if you re gamer or need to do lot of scrolling 
positive,it works really good for this cheap of headset was really suprised just got razor headset not to long ago but this one works even better think
neutral,comfy looks cool
positive,granddaughter loves it
neutral,exactly what the title says
positive,i like this item lot very fairly priced and the low profile makes it easy on my hand don have the largest hands but not very small either and mouse with high hump is very uncomfortable this solves that problem nicely could do without the sleep mode am still getting used to waking it up and understand the value of sleep mode so deal with it never having to deal with batteries is also bonus charging it overnight is ideal but have already forgotten couple of nights and it fine if necessary you can plug it in and use it while it charges 
neutral,exactly what the title says
positive,okay so cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse my husband is the gamer can however let you know about my general usage opinion first off it pretty love the color and love that it lights up on the sides there is setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain ve been using it for days pretty consistently and haven needed to charge it there wasn any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used just plugged in the small usb and it immediately worked that all can say at this point since haven had it that long will update this review in few months and include any issues may experience and any new opinions develop 
neutral,this purchase bangs more for your buck 
neutral,they are of quality construction and withstand the constant on off very good product 
neutral,so far have been loving this keyboard have not had any drop outs on the wireless would recommend for anyone causal but serious gamers know to always go wired 
negative,i dislike the product because the product doesn work well supposed to use for gaming really it was waste of money
positive,so lovely like the it so much can wait to open up 
positive,i work remotely from various locations throughout the day mostly doing data entry this mouse is great for what do always works cool color 
negative,for starters the box came cut up dont know the reason anyone would have to cut pff part of the product box maybe im being paranoid dont know also as you can see on the pictures the keyboard was totally dirty with dust stains some minor scratches here and there and what seems to be food crumbs under keys leads me to think this was being used already by seller previous to selling as brand new lights look cool amd it conmects fine to my laptop but the lack of hygiene is what got to me dont buy 
positive,used this for work and it perfect quick and responsive cute appearance and very light battery life last good amount of time before requiring charge love the lights 
neutral,i ve had my mouse for just over month and the scroll tracker stopped working now need to buy new mouse 
neutral,the microphones too quiet
neutral,mine did not hold charge very long day at the most if don use it for work when used it for work needed to plug it in half through my workday so use it only on my private computer couple hours day 
positive, love it for the pool and parties love the colour and the quality of the sound previously got bose but preferred to give it to my mother and keep this green one 
positive,great sound and comfortable
neutral,i bought this item and it was echoing so got it replaced now with my replaced heaphone can only hear out of the right side terrible do notrecommend buying 
positive,great
positive,works great surprisingly it is also durable my year old used them and throws them around 
negative,just very bad mouse alk around 
negative,i hated this item they described how easy it was to use and received mine and it does not connect after doing my research on it its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not so now have to order different one im very disappointed in this product 
positive,great sound quality and very comfortable
neutral,solid headphones
negative,very nice sleek design was expecting lot more given the reviews but mouse stopped working after weeks the usb and usb adaptors are very flimsy and prone to bending so as soon as go to plug it into my computer it does not connect definitely would not recommend unless you are looking for product to use for about week or two 
positive,easy to setup fit nice on the palm of your hand
neutral,i just got this not very long ago it just stopped tracking on the page and just out right quit it is piece of junk to me and would never buy this again am not happy and wasted my money on this 
positive,i love this product it nice design very light in weight and does what want it to do charges with ease happy got it 
positive,great sound and last for long time without needing to keep charging it 
neutral,product was easy to set up however only lasted month charging port broke after weeks and was not able to get it to charge few weeks after that 
positive,might not be ideal for gaming because of the lag but works perfectly for of the situations one charge lasts days of very heavy usage so it convenient at the time of my purchase this was the only wireless backlit proper keyboard and still happy with the purchase 
negative,i love this mouse but am so bummed it broke after months the roller ball completely stopped working but at least could still use the mouse to navigate the screen 
positive,love it 
positive,sweet good quality
neutral,was enjoying the use of the mouse until one day the usb stopped being recognized 
positive,i originally ordered my granddaughter the jbl flip as surprise gift on dec rd asked her what her main gift she hoped she received she stated the jbl charge ordered it while waiting for the train at pm and had it by pm dec th perfect gift 
positive,gets loud enough to hear outside in the yard crisp sound great sound 
negative,i bought this mouse few months ago and the usb receiver broke however contacted the seller about the issue and they sent me new mouse at no cost 
positive,loved it so much we bought two
positive,i wanted to get replacement for my gaming setup ps due to wear and tear on my old unit this gaming headset is solid replacement for what had before it got wide range of output makes in game noises clear and pleasure to wear for several hours 
positive,i bought this product in november by december the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped ll admit liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again here we are in february and the same exact thing has happened again used this mouse for my work computer in the office and certainly don aggressively use the scroll wheel yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units both within the first weeks of use ve never had mouse break apart like this before so have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together suppose you get what you pay for shame because aesthetically it is very nice will never buy this product again would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away pay few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than few weeks side note look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review rolls eyes perhaps ll just copy and paste their request here for the rest of you to read ha
neutral,this product doesn hurt my ears like most headphones 
neutral,very fragile when dropped 
positive,bought this for my son and he says it awesome mic works great and the sound is amazing great product for great price 
positive,i liked the she sound quality and how comfortable the headset overall feels 
positive,i love this mouse but hate it at the same time love it because it cute and it functions well that is if it doesn run out of battery charge during normal use the charge only lasts for about days it good that it can be recharged just didn think would be recharging it that often you can tell when it running low because it starts jumping all over the place just try to remember to charge it while charging my laptop also was under the impression that it came as usbc to charge and it does not it comes with an adapter for usb to usbc could ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear 
positive,i bought this mouse for my daughter and she absolutely loves it would defiantly recommend this mouse and would purchase again especially for the price 
neutral,the item stopped working only months after receiving won hold charge and turns off immediately 
neutral,it easy to use
positive,good fit
positive,i love it 
neutral, 
positive,very good product love the way it lights up charges very easy and battery last long time before recharge 
positive,best gaming headset for an affordable price 
neutral,pros surprisingly the battery charge lasts me looooong time think it lasted me month on one charge one of the cheapest in the market cons the first one got didn work the replacement one worked but sometimes the scroll is backwards 
positive,this is my second one to add to the one have great product that connects seamlessly with the other great sound and super durable
positive,i love the power save mode
neutral,listening to podcasts
positive,i actually have pixel slate and it works great with it 
neutral,for one this mouse is not compatible with the adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device update it and see why the adapter isn working or remove this item 
negative,although just yesterday ordered the jbl charge and so haven received it yet did some research into how the device charges on one end of the charging cable is the new and better type of usb connector usb and on the other the standard well familiar usb connector the charging port on the speaker only accepts the new type of usb connector known as usb not the standard usb that we are well familiar with however the unit comes supplied with sided cable that will plug into standard usb port such as on most or all home and office computers and also some ac wall chargers the speaker does not come with this necessary usb accepting ac wall charger so if you do not have one already you have to buy one someplace otherwise simply plug it into usb port on computer the new type of usb connector usb is better because it is the same all around that is you no longer need to worry if the jack is orientated properly before inserting it ll work no matter which way you plug it in much convenient design over the old think but am not sure that it might also work faster than the old and familiar usb connector however at least as of now there is still standard usb connector on the other end of the cable so perhaps the faster charging speeds assuming even correct on this might only be the case when these cables have the new type of usb usb connectors on both ends in any case as is it still better than the standard usb because of not having to fumble around when attempting to plug it in not only is it annoying fumbling around with the old standard usb connectors the fumbling can actually damage the insides of usb port due to repeated attempts at trying to insert an improperly orientated connector like trying to force square peg into round hole after while the inners of the port will get bent out of shape however this is much more of problem with the standard mini usb connectors commonly used with mobile phones and many other small devices 
positive,my favorite color work great plenty of wire space
neutral,stopped working in about an hour 
neutral, 
neutral,had to use different type to usb adapter because this one did not work 
neutral,i can hear but the mic has never worked even after much troubleshooting they re also pretty uncomfortable compared to other headphones ve had 
negative,i don really like leaving bad reviews but these headphones were not what was hoping for got these for my boyfriend and now feel like crap cuz feel like got him cheap headphones for christmas they look cool and the sound quality is fine not the greatest but it does the job for the most part the microphone is not the greatest and all his friends say they can barely hear him on the other end no matter what he does and we have messed with this since december and it not gotten better the mic picks up lot of background staticky sounds and if you want the lights to be on they have to either be plugged into portable battery or plugged in plugged in or plugged into your gaming conceal or computer just little disappointed because the reviews seemed great on this but oh well they are cool but not the best for gaming
neutral,don work 
positive,this thing works well most of the time if you don turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode it dies fairly quickly but you still get couple of days of use out of it if you re not using it hours day at least if you turn it off every time you re done though you can get probably month but at least weeks out of it with moderate use originally bought it to use with my ipad however the case on my ipad wouldn really allow the usb to plug into the charger port wish they made an option to get either usb or usb plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the usb into the usb adapter which makes the usb plug significantly thicker than necessary now use it for my macbook just warning if you want it to scroll like regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer but that macbook problem not problem with this mouse not all of apple setting decisions make sense but that nothing new do really like that can chose to just turn on the mouse with solid red color which preserves battery or turn it on to change colors reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is cool feature my only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn tracking perfectly and the cursor is in completely different place than would expect it to be further behind where was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing but that may also be thing have to change on the laptop 
positive,lights look great last long 
neutral,lights don turn on on my xbox controller and you have to scream so people can hear you
positive,beautiful 
neutral,it works fine just seems little cheap and not real comfortable 
negative,the metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop talking about being sick
neutral,won stay charged 
positive,i have to charge this mouse way more than expected especially since use it for work won buy this again otherwise seems to work fine besides sometimes jumping from where have the pointer on the screen to whole other area casual usage this may be fine for you
positive,the charge has beautiful sound and is very easy to set up and operate am very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for small portable speaker with great sound 
negative,the scroll up and down is not working at all tried everything and its not working looks like it defective or used they send me 
negative,the keys are very easy to type on but hate how the keyboard has positive tilt built in this is bad for one wrists 
neutral, months later and it does not work 
neutral,my son is using for gaming on ps 
neutral,did not work at all
positive,this mouse is amazing work in it and have been working from home for quite some time there are days where have to work hours my hand does not get tired at all when using this mouse for long periods of time it is super easy to setup just connect to the usb and you re done the best part that love about this mouse is that it is superrrrrrrrrr quiet the weeks that on call do not have to feel discouraged and walking on eggshells when have to respond to an urgent matter in the middle of the night and having to risk waking up my partner with the continuous mouse clicking sound will definitely buy another one just in case if lose it 
neutral,when first got this item it worked fine but after couple of weeks it was not moving the arrow very well dropped it once and it stopped working altogether 
positive,they work perfectly for my son and his online gaming needs good buy great seller
positive,great sound and long battery life waterproof too love this speaker just can seem to get it to link with my other jbl charge 
positive,this is great standalone bluetooth speaker unfortunately jbl connect is wildly unpredictable so if you want to connect multiple compatible jbl speakers using this technology you will experience lots of dropouts of one or the other of the speakers it very frustrating otherwise the sound is great battery life is superb etc use it while camping quite lot and it gets me through multiple days of normal use without even considering recharge 
negative,this was the worst mouse ve bought it goes dead very fast and then you have to charge it all night for it to die fast again would not recommend this mouse 
positive,i was slightly reluctant to buy because of the price but it was worth every penny even hooked it up to my tv and it completely changes any movie to near movie theater quality right in your home without the expensive set ups love how portable it iswith long battery life to boot it daily use for the warehouse work in for all the music we play at work 
positive,very comfortable blocks out noise really good
neutral,if you only need to use mouse for no more than an hour this might be okay bought for my office for my laptop bag and for home they do not hold charge 
neutral,it flimsy and the battery doesn last long you constantly have to charge and you can put batteries waste of money
neutral,good sound quality and decent range 
neutral,good as expected 
neutral,i like that can use the charger it came with to charge it no batteries required 
positive,a great headset for gaming

neutral,product works as advertised no issues until the wheel simply stopped working one day about months in you don realize how much you use said wheel until um you don have that function anymore otherwise great product 
positive,after year of using these headphones am finally going to get rid of these that not to say it bad it just not for me after year these still work great even though they ve fallen too many times to count the audio is fine but everything else is lacking straight out of the box the microphone levels were too low so had to already go to my sound panel and microphone boost it to db could hear my voice nice and clear but it picked up just about everything else in my room not to mention that it also picked up the sounds from the speakers inside the earcups made it impossible for me to play in voice chat with friends because you would hear double the audio now onto the build quality of the headset you get what you pay for am pretty small person kinda sad and this headphone was still too small for me it hurt my ears and the sides of my heads for dollars it decent set of headphones but recommend you buy something better 
positive, am in love with this mouse its just perfect for the price been using it lot and only need to charge it once really recommend it 
positive,works really good love the color
neutral,do not recommend this product it was super cheap feeling and did not work well at all 
neutral,bought this december th now july th and at first it was amazing downloaded the drivers and it worked flawlessly now months later the keys have slowly stopped working it misses keys push all the time and it has become hassle even trying to game when it misses the keys my backlight will go out if press harder it does nothing if roll my finger around the key am holding it will start working for little while my keyboard and desktop do not sit in dusty or dirty environment either and neither are abused as well as my current mouse this is an extremely low quality product and you definitely get what you pay for do business elsewhere they also no longer offer the drivers on the website

positive,i researched lot before buying this speaker and honeslty jbl did quite spectacular job the bass is satisfying even more than its rivals the distortion is not not present at all the outdoor compatibility is too good to be true just be careful not to puncture hoke in the side radiators though its quite hard to 
positive,the best website to get gaming equipment got my gaming mouse and headphones from here and never had problem 
positive,love
positive,the reason why bought this was because wanted better sound quality when played video games the reason why it is good is because it has good sound quality for example you can hear lot of things with the headphones like where things are say you can hear someone you know if they are on the right or the left the next reason is that it has long cord so it doesn make you lean forward when you play game for example when you use normal headphones the cord is so short that when you plug it in you have to lean forward to make sure that you can use it these headphones you have no problem the last reason is that it has the ability to connect to all devices for example you can connect it to things like pc ps xbox ect after using them think that would recommend them 
positive,very quiet and comfortable great response time 
positive,i got these for my son to use for his switch and he loves them like that you can control the volume on them and turn the mic on and off they also cancel lot of the background noise so it is easier for you to concentrate and hear the game

positive,got this as surprise gift really really good headphones for gaming works all systems have ps and have not been dissatisfied since day one using them
neutral,the mouse works fine it is slim kind of cheap plastic but the lights which in photos look like it would just be thin line around the mouse are very annoying the entire thing lights up you can not turn them off and still use the mouse it is very distracting did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong but will donate it to charity or someone ordered another one with no lights 
positive,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse

positive,i needed mouse for my laptop and so bought this the set up was really easy simply charge the mouse plug in the usb and done the silent clicks are indeed quiet but wouldn say they re completely inaudible but that totally okay with me when the mouse charges it turns blue and when it done charging the light will switch off when turn on the mouse to the color mode the colors fade nicely to the next the only nitpick for me is that wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don peek through it but it personal preference also like how it came with usb to usbc adapter just in case it needs to be used for mac overall great mouse 
negative,very disappointed my daughter was extatic about getting these only to be disappointed in quality and difficulty hearing with the volume up don waste your
neutral,doesn hook up to my xbox don say that something can connect to something if it doesn that false advertisement

negative,i love the way the mouse looks and feels but oh the mistakes make this mouse has mind of it own and jumps all over the place have accidentally closed files programs while working on them move public folder and having to contact it to move back and many more random errors as result of this erratic mouse sometimes while not even using the mouse can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen perhaps there is ghost in the machine but if so they are hostile will be replacing it asap

positive,great item and came so quick thank you 
negative,it was working well until it just stopped working after months it won charge and turn on anymore pretty much useless now not well made and it waste of money if you re looking for reliable and and an item that will last long do not get this one coz you will be disappointed tried my luck and didn listen to the reviews read now am so disappointed could have spend more to most reliable and long lasting one 
neutral,very poor sound little to zero bass poor app support and miserablr battery life if you are using this for outdoor or warehouse usage it will disappoint full charge this morning granted hours of play at to volume quite far beneath the hours promised if it had lasted hours might keep it but the sound just isn worth metal music sounds terrible and you have to put your ear up to the speaker to hear it at volume how does this garbage get passed off as premium stuff returning it immediately and taking the leap to bose 
negative,the battery wont fully charge and takes day to charge when it should only take hours the charging system dosent work and it disconnects random sometimes while watching movie ive only had it for month and used it very little very disappointed 
positive,very easy to use and efficient 
negative,stopped working after months what waste 
negative,it works like it should originally thought it was broken and the seller reached out and fully refunded me but it turns out it was user error 
neutral,i have this mouse for days and now it just doesn charge no idea why and ve tried everything do not buy it cheap 
neutral,we use this on the boat and the beach brother has one too and they will connect wirelessly with no problem waterproof but will not float without an extra buoy

neutral,pc mice ve purchased in the past lasted years not months caution purchase of this mouse for tha reason 
positive,great product used it on the beach all summer long never failed load clear and crisp loved it we now have one for me and one for me daughter 
neutral,it has all the necessary features needed 
neutral,i bought this keyboard because it seemed like deal with the backlit and silent key features found the backlit features to be almost irrelevant when using in the dark because the alternating and dark colors made it difficult to see put silent keys in quotation marks because they re not really silent the keys felt no different than basic keyboard that you can buy for if you re looking for good quality and can spend more suggest logitech that why immediately unhooked it and returned it so can go back to buying the logitech 
negative,i am so angry now the battery life was short had to charge very short time after first use it was out of battery again today so changed it it worked for about minutes after charged then stopped responding tried all usb ports of my laptop all working so it the keyboard tried wireless or wired doesn work it just doesn work 
positive,the mouse checks all my needs wireless low profile and inexpensive used to have roller ball mouse but found myself having to frequently clean the ball from lint and dirt so this is vast improvement ve used this for few days now and haven had to charge it yet so so far so solid 
positive,it is an amazing headphone and has the best audio
positive,if you just need wireless keyboard it is as decent as any other no complaints in terms of typing the back lit function however is very weak the brightest setting really does not brighten the key lettering so you can see in darkened room what you re typing the backlit is just very nice looking dressing that brightens under the keys and constantly shuts off so you have to click something then undo before can type with the fancy light on practical level the back light is really useless just nice to look at nothing more
neutral,i like that it rechargeable unfortunately the scroller on top doesn work used with both my macbook and laptop 
positive,it often stops working at random points even with full charge there will be sudden fits where it won respond for good seconds or it will be super laggy with its inputs was an idiot forgot it had warranty and bought the first one at least had the courtesy to wait few months to bug out day this thing bugged but like the feel of the keyboard its damn satisfying keyboard when it works the buttons are nice to press and the keyboard feels nice in general that why bought another hoping the first was faulty the lights are nice also but sadly cant recommend it if keyboards have similar bugs hell even typing this out was an ordeal especially when was listing the positives of it will be sending it to repairs but really hope they straighten this problem out 
neutral,doesn stay charged long enough bought and both are the same sometime on down the road llput new rechargeable batteries in both and see if that is the problem they do fit nice to use and runsmooth 
positive,son loves it great product for the price 
positive,i love this mouse it so silent and smooth to the touch 
neutral,update after working with the company they refunded my faulty headphones they told me that they have new manufacturer use that information to decide if you are willing to risk it at the price offered thankful they at least tried to rectify the issue hope they don keep selling the faulty product 
neutral,people could barely hear me no matter how close the mic was to my face
positive,like the colors but mic is not close enough for people to hear me well wire seems to long 
positive,best ever used in years of gaming
negative,i bought these about year ago and when received them they appeared to be fine but when used them the cord is heavy thick and tugging the worst part is that if you ever take off the black wrap around the cord the cord will dwindle and tangle until it decides to do it until it permanently damages itself used them for about hours one day and never touched them even though they were annoying and noticed in video clip saved the microphone cut out randomly but audio still coming through the headset and was confused because never did anything to damage them so they eventually damage themselves by tangling asked my dad to get me another pair of headphones and told him not the same ones but by the time they had already arrived it had been the same and he didn realized that he bought the same pair but figured give them another shot once again they tangled themselves to death one day and realized how cheap this company was and how terrible their products are and how cheaply made they are if there is anything in this review you note down do not but these headphones the worst part is them tangling beyond repair and the annoyance of the excess weight to the cord quite embarrassing for the company to own such terrible product 
positive, this is great gaming headset for xbox it has very good noise cancellation my son really liked the blue lights but just heads up as someother reviewers have stated the blue light only turns on when connected to laptop or pc because you need to insert the usb cable in my son doesn seem to mind it while playing xbox though he loves his new gaming headset great customer support from bengoo too 
neutral,no depth annoying to listen to 
positive,you get what you pay for it worth it the base is great sound quality flawless bluetooth connected we re ordering another one to balance out the sound in our large pool area 
neutral,i bought this mouse for home use used it about two hours per day for two weeks then no connection thought it needed to be charged plugged it in and allowed to sit for two hours as instructed now there is nothing tried to charge longer but nothing is working do not buy this pos

positive,had slight hiccup with the product but the kind and generous customer service fixed my issues swiftly all and all great headset my son loves it 
positive,needed mouse for my laptop lights are awesome 
positive,this keyboard was great and effective at first ve had it for about months before it started having connectivity issues the keyboard is not communicating anymore and the keystrokes are not showing up on my screen the window to return this item closed months ago so stuck with this keyboard that will be recycling be wary of this product 
neutral,the mouse started off okay it worked like it should for few weeks but then the battery would not make it through my work day the charge lasted less each time until suddenly it stopped holding charge like other reviews state it stopped working literally days after the return window closed ll be buying name brand mouse now 
negative,purchased in july by november it would no longer charge mail to seller sent to address in the instructions would not go thru mail said that recipient server did not accept our requests to connect would not buy from this seller ever again 
neutral,these headphones do not work will be returning highly disappointed had high hopes 
positive,excellent sound quality with lengthy battery life
positive,i used these headphones mainly for gaming on my playstation but they worked just as good on my pc ve bought more expensive gaming headphones and these can compete with those except for the noise canceling but it not bad the long chord gives you room for gaming from distance and the volume control on the chord is nicely placed the led lights looks pretty nice and the fact you have an option to use them or not but still use the headphones is nice addition 
negative,the calibration on this is terrible can even use it it goes all over the place doesn go where im directing it to go make calls for work on my computer and it hung up when was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen it terrible 
positive,awesome product works great for playing online games not bad for the price 
positive,it was easy to connect and worked great then it worked for while was perfect then it job stopped working out of nowhere

positive,my son loves them
neutral,i just received this yesterday and am planning to return it seems very cheaply made product not taking the chance 
positive,these headphones work perfectly have to tell at my kid so that he can notice me lol so the noise cancelation works and don have to tell him to turn his gear down because we can hear it blasting away these were the perfecto gift for that gamer in your house 
neutral,i have hour shift have it fully charged in the beginning of my shift and hours later it already done sounds is great battery sucks

neutral,good headset for the price 
positive,great product for the price my daughter loves it it is so quiet when you re clicking the buttons that you can hear it at all so have decided to purchase myself one as well 
positive,i love this mouse and it works great 
negative,broke after no more than minutes of use something on the inside disconnected and the scrawling wheel spins freely not only it was waste of money actually needed compact mouse for my portable office forgot all about it in my trip now it is too late to return it you get what you pay for 
positive, it good mouse led good im still trying learn how it works but so far so good for now
neutral,this is my first time purchased mechanical keyboard for regular office work the mechanical keyboard more tactile and faster like that 
positive,i love these they are great gaming headphones and amazing in general for gaming they are very handy 
neutral, at first really liked this mouse it was lightweight and had sleek design it ended there every time go to use the mouse throughout the day have to return it on even when it already in the on position anyone that is used to any other type of wireless mouse and you just use it anytime will quickly become annoyed with this mouse the fact that you have to flip the switch on and off every time you go to use it makes it poor choice 
negative,i had this for one day and the connection issues were terrible towards the end it wouldn even type anymore charged it and nothing this utterly truly sucked save yourself dollars and your patience 
neutral,it takes as much time to charge the mouse as to use it not practical otherwise the mouse worksand it is ergonomical
neutral,the scroll wheel broke after weeks of minimal use 
negative,i has purchased charge in the past great the charge will not hold charge have followed online instructions to no avail charge engineers fired one and all complete fail recommend you follow my advice and never purchase charge speaker you will only have yourself to blame very disappointed 
positive,i bought this for home office and liked it so much bought second one for work to use instead of what the company supplied to me it everything the description says it is very comfortable too 
neutral,this speaker is worth every penny 
positive, finally sleep mode works on this upgraded led mouse sleep mode is must for mouse because not every time you ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for short break or so it does it for you to save battery note sleep mode does work on color mode the previous mouse wouldn sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse 
neutral,it last long time charge it maybe every days maybe once week go to school times week and in nursing school so lot of homework just purchased but it already making noise when scroll up or down 
positive,product as described looks great with the lights ordered twice 
neutral,just what wanted battery life tbd
positive,was great had smooth control felt great in your hand had small issue getting it to charge but figured it out love the style function of this mouse
neutral,can barely hear myself talk with them on huge plus 
neutral,worked fine at first about month in and now it gets glitchy for no reason flat design makes for poor support of hand not for gaming 
positive,use for desktop computer works great 
neutral,didn work piece of crap
neutral,too tight
positive,overall the speaker is great it is quite bit hefty but that is to be expected with all the rubber keeping it waterproof as well as the rest of the hardware inside the battery life is pretty spot on with about hour of constant usage and the sound is clear and loud very much worth the purchase and if you catch it on sale even more so 
neutral,this is exactly what needed my favorite features are the quite clicks and the led lights 
neutral,works well with my dell laptop
neutral,this is great speaker but the battery life is no bueno guys in less then month my battery life just keep on going down so be aware
positive,my son got this for his birthday and he loves them 
neutral,my kids have had different headphones for their nintendo switch have had to return all others within few days of purchase due to problems these headphones are compatible with the nintendo switch and we haven had any issues 
neutral,made of very cheap material they broke the first day using them
neutral,i knew it was too good to be true this would be great mouse but it just stopped working after week have charged it few times prior no issues went to use it today and nothing would avoid and spend few more bucks on something not as cheaply made 
neutral,i use for music
positive,excellent gaming keyboard purchased this for my grandson and he loves it takes gaming to whole new level with his xbox 
neutral,the mouse stopped working after one week got no response from their customer service 
positive,this is very nice mouse for the price the charge in the battery lasts long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever perfect for use during lecture at school when you don want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises not sure how this would be for gamers but the switchable dpi is very nice feature as well also do feel that should point out that the rgb lights are switchable on and off which is nice feature if you are like me and are in class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips 
neutral,i bought these for my classroom have sixteen total they are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode think it good office mouse for anyone who isn using it in setting where lot of them are being used do not buy if you need more than one 
positive,i ve been using this speaker for couple of months now and the sound quality is awesome really recommend it 
positive,great for gaming and everyday use 
positive,really in photo it looks more beautiful and of better quality than when you have it in personthe color has disappointed me since expected it to be more stylish and with better finishes 
positive,solid keyboard lighting is bit dim and the timeout is definitely too short as it goes dark too quickly other than those issues it works perfectly and the battery life has been more than adequate 
neutral,initially thought it great piece but slowly am struggling to use it as it stops working or goes to sleep for long does not get activated by just simply moving bit has to moved few times or even hit it on pad at time 
negative,when first received this charged it as recommended and it lit up so seemed to work as expected after charged put the toggle in my usb port and nothing happened it didn download anything it didn pair with my laptop let it sit then tried again nothing it won charge it won light up nothing never even used it and it stopped working very disappointed and total waste of money 
positive,i am not using the keyboard for gaming use it for everyday use of my personal computer love how it lights up so can see the keys without turning on the light in my office as an option the keys fell easy to press down on and it just feels comfortable to use after years also had an issue with one of the keys cracking and was very pleased that klim replaced the keyboard per their warranty thank you very much to them 
positive,the colors are really neat and the keyboard is an awesome fit with my setup 
positive,love how slim it is and battery free charge like cell phone and the beautiful colors that surrounds the mouse is outstanding
positive,i bought when started to play more mouse keyboard games and didn want to be tethered to the computer it pretty has nice height with the little feet but is little glitchy sometimes it might be that the charge is running out but it puts itself to sleep the lights turn off and the keys don register in bursts and have to switch back to my wired keyboard the only fix is to plug it into the computer with cord that is shorter than my existing wired keyboard cord 
neutral,i received my speaker and put it to charge and it never charged light will turn to show its charging but it never actually does call customer service and they said they will send me the return label through email and they never did 
positive,i find that not having to rely on battery is relief the color change is very nice
negative,this mouse was bad quality 
positive, just needed simple mouse for desktop only use for watching videos in my living room its super quiet and lightweight no lag also using it for cricut designspace with no issues 
positive,this is the perfect little speaker that has great sound picks up everything from hip hop to edm to instrumental very good quality sound and the bluetooth connection is the easiest ve ever used get from my car to the house and it instantly picks up the music
positive,its great product
neutral,we tried and have hard time trying to connect then it disconnects no light power for the macbook so don use this for any apple devices it does it should work but gives hard time get frustrated better for those other computers laptop
positive,love this in every way didn expect it to be so clear and have such nice bass it holds charge pretty much all day it perfect 
neutral,this mouse only worked for one charging when charged it the second time everything works backwards want to go left it goes right your want it to go up it goes down don recommend this item they say you can return it 
neutral,to slow don buy
positive,works great no problems so far lights up nicely 
neutral,i can hear sound coming from them but the mic stopped working after the second day of use and can get it to work now 
positive,i use when on the run something to blue tooth with great product 
negative,it not the best you get what you pay for 
negative,doesn work at all the two pieces barely even connect let alone to the laptop waste of time and money cheaply made 
neutral,decent mouse looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the cheapness of the mouse cursor tracking is the biggest issue the cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the dts button doesn seem to do anything for controlling this 
positive,i use this keyboard with my laptop for work it much more comfortable for me to type on than the mall laptop keyboard silent and has good touch great reactivity and the lights are fun don use it for gaming but as working keyboard it great 
positive,i opened it it connected to my phone it loud and wonderful love it
positive,what really liked was the usb to type adapter which allowed me to plug usb memory sticks into my smart phone 
positive,the mouse seemed nice when got it and has great feel in your hand with quiet clicks however after weeks of every other day use the scroll wheel stopped working returned it for replacement and now weeks after receiving the replacement that scroll wheel has also stopped working because the original purchase was outside the return window return was not possible would not buy again and am going with different product from different seller manufacturer 
positive,this is really nice wireless keyboard if you don need too many bells whistles game on my tv so sit pretty far away and haven had trouble with connectivity yet the rgb is simple but nice and switching between the different modes is easy 
neutral,good product for the price 
positive,this headset is comfortable wear 
positive,i purchased these to replace terrible set of headphones my job provided for remote working am not on the phone constantly so was not looking to spend time of my own money for work have three sets of beats for private use and while these do not compare for the price they are excellent they are simpler cancel noise as much as need and price was perfect they arrived in time and in good condition would not recommend for advanced gaming or hardcore users in need of studio quality products but for new gamer young child or someone looking to replace bad office bought equipment would recommend little else hat would do as good of job 
positive,i bought this love the looks and the feel however used it for days and it quit working 
positive,works great
neutral,i have yet to be disappointed by bengoo products and this follow suit the sound is absolutelyphenomenal and these are comfortable the moment felt the head cushion when removing it from the packaging was shocked at how soft it was for very affordable gaming needs with high end quality you have to use bengoo 
neutral,i have had this mouse for about seven days and it is not track well if there delay and it only broken the click button has already broken my advice if you want something very sleek it great sleek mouse but it not reliable don cheap out and get better mouse 
positive,for jbl expected better sound spend little more and get better model 
neutral,listen love jbl and although it is good speaker was scammed it has only one built in speaker as opposed to the they usually have and this was higher price disappointing still good speaker but was little mad 
neutral, moving fast and light easy to hold for moving
neutral,i bought this because it looked small and exactly what was looking for when received it turned it on and it lit up got excited to only put it to charge and it completely stopped lighting up tried everything to no avail it either fried during charging or just quit working either way returned it and got my money back 
positive,i got this for my daughter and she loves it they seem to be very durable she very rough on them 
positive,great speaker love this thing absolutely the best have ever had 
positive,i had this model on hold for long while as searched for the best all around speaker for my year old sons bday this thing is awesome sound is crisp and clear and no vibration or sound distortion at the highest level from rap to reggaton this speaker is awesome jbl is an old brand and still putting out great product even the color design is solid without peeling have two more on my list for christmas for my other son and my husband definitely recommend buying the case this does come with usb type cord but no charging block to plug into the wall this is also charger and has an on off button volume is controlled by bluetooth on smart phone instant change between songs without skipping or hesitation make sure you look all yhrough the box so you don accidentally throw the cord out 
neutral,works well 
positive,should have had usb charging port on it instead of micro usb otherwise it great for my daughter year old hands 
neutral, 
neutral,very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn work all other buttons worked thou
positive,perfect for my year old the size adjusts to fit his head and expands for anyone else in the family he especially lights the color and lights can speak for sound quality since so haven used it myself but he happy 
positive,the easy on and off buttons quality of sound color black bit heavier than anticipated but that is ok 
positive,works well charge last long timedelivery time is good
positive,i got this speaker to upgrade from my old ue boom well would say the only things it does better is battery life and little more volume when you turn the jbl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effecting the highs and the speaker is very directional so it very difficult to find location for the speaker that doesn turn it into shrill little squeak box the ue have is much smaller speaker but it has nearly degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles all in all the jbl definitely wasn worth the money sticking with ue 
positive,very good quality sleek and pretty use it for my desk at work the only issue is when using it to scroll page the ball starts squeaking otherwise it great 
positive,i liked the fact that it tuned everything and everyone out could hear everything amazing suround sound love them
neutral,don wast your money cheap chinese product 
positive,i really like how easy it was to setup 
positive,it feels soft on my head when wear it and the noise cancellation works wonders love gaming and need new headset and this one was the perfect replacement
neutral,nice packaging counts for little when the instruction manual tells you nothing about how to use it had to go to youtube also for touch typists you may find it too soft quiet returned
positive,it an ok product for the most part there are few things that noticed that lead me to give this product only stars the sleep time on the led feature is too short and not adjustable it turns off the led lights after about seconds and if you re trying to use it in the dark this defeats the purpose of getting an illuminated keyboard there should be an ability to leave it on the brightness on the led lights is not very good in completely dark room it may be passable but in room with partial illumination like lamp or even the light from your tv monitor screen the keys get little lost and not easy to see since they blend with the glare from the screen the chroma colors make such dimly lit product that much harder to see and you can adjust this it would be better if you could make it just green white or blue lights but the chroma color runs across the keyboard and the red color is very dim to top it off the leds are so far under the keys that you get more of halo effect around the underside of the key than lighting up the key characters themselves the only pros have about this product are the price cheap for what it is the quiet no click of the keys perfect if someone else is in the room trying to sleep usb charger compatible aside from the things mentioned at the top of this post there are some extras that could have made this product better dedicated buttons for ff rev play pause vol up down mute having to constantly press function button for basic features like those when you want to control music or volume is annoying removable rechargeable batteries you can replace and charge in the unit when the charger is plugged in had mouse that did this and it was great feature and when the battery could no longer hold charge just replaced it the ghz dongle is awesome but also having bluetooth option can make this better and able to connect to devices that don have usb ports but keep the dongle not happy with mine will return it and spend little more on better solution for me 
positive,mainly mouse youd keep at home on desk not really suited for travel battery life is great charged it once month ago and for being in highschool all of our work is on the chromebook and this mouse hasnt died yet
positive,super easy to connect to it really powerful and loud thing happy with its addition to my patio my neighbors not so much 
positive,so far great purchase bought rose gold and it looks so cute mouse works well slim and compact 
positive,love the product bought for my microsoft surface pro and it works perfectly
neutral,good
negative,it is quite nice it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it special touch unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy the sleep mode seems to fail constantly sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for while being fully charged so it must be damaged internally very disappointed with this product no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function 
neutral,expected to have more volume better frequency range 
negative,worthless to spend min trouble shooting every time need to use it 
positive,sleek ergonomic feel quiet clicker easy to charge usb easy to install would definitely recommend for the price 
neutral,so so
neutral,the features on this mouse are really good it worked well initially but after only days it wouldn work anymore and ended up in the garbage do not recommend buying this one 
positive,love it would recommend works great love that it light and can hear when you click the mouse lights are very cute
neutral,the on off switch often feels like there is sand in the mouse when moving it it not smooth move like would have expected like the mouse but that roughness is annoying at times 
positive,cool mouse like it changes colors while using it love the fact never have to use batteries again for mouse 
negative,i admit that might have overused it since bought it for my work from home but my sis got similar one which is why bought this one and that one actually lasts days without the need of chargei needed to charge this one multiple times on the day and at one point it just wouldn work even while plugged in so still needed to switch to the old oneit is really disappointing idk if got faulty product or if that is actually the extent of its productivity
negative,a month after use and after charge or two the mouse is not longer usable the battery is completely dead and will not charge completely unusable and waste 
neutral,i guess you get what you paid for the mouse will not stay charged and will not connect with my ipad super disappointed 
neutral, loved this mouse but after couple of months it started making weird noise while scrolling points for that
positive,very light weight and comfortable to use for basic computer tasks it was also very easy to set up took less than minutes as it came charged also the vitter life has been great so far only needing to charge time in the weeks of having the item 
positive,connects well fits well on the ears sound quality is great and mic boom does good job definitely worth it 
positive,i think it good choice for starting out product it fairly good for the pricing and fits up to my expectations fits nicely and doesn hurt my ears like most headsets do 
neutral,sensor is all whacked out stopped working at days so out the money and have to purchase new mouse don do it
positive,like playing on my ps
neutral,not satisfied with the sound quality was expecting for this to be little louder
neutral,i received my speaker went to use it and it kept crackling so had to send it back was not impressed with this product and then they wouldn let me exchange it for new one had to get refund
neutral,spacious still have room for other items
negative,battery life is terrible and mouse stops working from time to time no idea how this product has such high reviews 
neutral,this mouse does seem to let you pick color and the same is not comfortable 
neutral,the mouse was working good and out of no where in the middle of me working it clicker just stop functioning unfortunately purchase this item on the th of january and my return window is now close really felt confident about this product and it is was nice while it lasted edit was spent replacement and it has given me any problems 
neutral,bloody good buy
positive,i thought was getting better mouse by splurging on the more expensive option but guess that doesn seem to matter would think get decent working product for bucks but guess that also doesn seem to be thing save yourself the trouble of thinking this is quality product and actually buy mouse that works have had all similar issues of not working after about month of use broke college student and really wish could have saved myself time and money 
positive,great product couldn be happier with this purchase 
neutral,stopped working shortly after can get refund or exchange
neutral,i ve used this product before and had no complaints this time purchased it charged it and the next day tried to use it and it wasn turning on at all tried to charge it again and the same result returned immediately 
positive,i love the quiet click no more obnoxious loud clicking 
neutral,very good
positive,this is portable powerhouse of speaker excellent sound quality this was birthday gift already own one and recommend it highly stars
negative,it stopped working my is very disappointed
neutral,was not at all what expected seems very cheaply made my computer started acted very weird when it was installed as was using it maybe this one was just defective but do not want another one 
positive,so we ve gone thru quite few wireless items over the last few years this one by far has knocked it out of the park actually allowed my year old to pick her mouse this year she and she picked based on color read the description the review were good and the price was right so we hit buy now love sleep mode really love that it rechargeable battery lasts weeks like that it lights up when it charging and let you know when it done and an added bonus it the cutest shade of baby pink 
neutral,great product but little too flat for me 
positive,great for gaming like there are input options the headphones are really sturdy the best part are the colored lights 
negative,poor quality the noise sucks and the sound quality is horrible wouldn even buy it for 
positive,excellent for call of duty
positive,it pretty good when you are in the game and need to listen to your teammates talking but when it come to really needing good ear its noise cancellation feature comes bit short it does dampen the noises outside fairly well but not enough for certain games that need an attentive ear but otherwise if you were to use this for gaming it pretty darn good for multiplayer and also really good for single player games 
positive,wish you could select the color of the rgb light it just cycles through all of them nothing in the instructions so it must only cycle besides that it nice super quiet click clicking the scroll wheel is loud and hard though 
positive,really love it
positive,the set up is so easy plug in and it ready to go charges completely in about hours the rose gold color is really cute 
negative,was decent first month very flat so not ergonomic but that personal taste issue is this is already broken the scroll wheel no longer works even for mouse that pretty pathetic since ve had other mouses for years at time had the same issue as other reviews with the cursor randomly jumping too so there might be some design issue with the sensor 
negative,works well but son broke within week dropped it and it shattered 
positive,product worked great for st months now the usb charging port is bad and since it rechargable mouse it useless now led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks being optical vs laser it isn for gaming and battery wouldn last all day clicking it also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into hassle 
positive,my son loves it it lights up he says he feels like he in the game
positive,the click wheel stopped working two days after the return window the colors are pretty it fun mouse but pretty basic would not buy this again
negative,had this for month and it already dead doesn charge and tried multiple usb cables would highly not recommend this or any no name products they are similar
positive,just got this so not sure how it will hold up over time it was very well packaged could have drop kicked it without damage arrived within stated range the speaker was nearly fully charged charging was as easy as attaching usb came with usb cable but no adapter got plenty of those so actually happy about the non duplication bluetooth pairing with my android phone was quick and easy sound is bit base heavy but is rich and full no buzz even when cranked easily filling room it looks well built and based on my inspection could probably withstand complete submersion so far very happy if it continues to perform well will buy another one or more and link them for more intense sound experience the intended use of this speaker is relatively humid wine cellar 
positive,i use this for work and it is great exactly as described with both usb and jack for my laptop the wire is super long so can get up from my desk when using and the padding on the earpieces is super comfortble 
positive,always loved these speakers and always will this one you re paying for more vocals than bass still maginifico only problem was my connectivity issues when first got this speaker could walk through my house with no problems now months later cant go steps literally out of range from the speaker without it skipping overall still great speaker
negative,the mouse seems to work fine and looks nice but arrived very dirty the box being dirty can understand due to shipping but the mouse itself has lint few pieces of pet hair and the track scroll is dirty as if it been used lot it was not described as used but very much appears to be and upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box 
positive,honestly the soft push of the keys feel weird maybe because used to laptop keyboard with very shallow keys and friends boards with more clicky keys it doesn feel satisfying to type with connectivity was super easy and the lights are nice there is slight buzzing sound from the lights however 
positive,this is the best mouse and love that it is rechargeable haven had lag problem unlike mouse that requires batteries loved it so much bought another 
positive,i love it really good
neutral,color is not shiny black cheap plastic material
positive,i love this keyboard can easily see the keys in the dark and the lighting effect is calm and inspirational 
positive,awesome and cool the color turns red when it time to plug in and recharge 
positive,i love the headset and it works great
neutral,bought months ago now have to charge it every other day 
positive,works and the battery lasts week or two with frequent use and charges easily one less cord to get snarled in my laptop case too the lights around the edge seem silly but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark goes to sleep after few minutes of nonuse requires mouse click to wake it up nuisance but that means you need not bother to turn it off overall very pleased 
positive,proscharge lasts long timecolorfullooks cool on my deskconsthe return key is like hundred miles away so you have to stretch your pinky out to hit return
positive,these headphones sound great and the noise cancellation is amazing but unfortunately the mic audio output full doesn seem to be good when play online on the xb with my friends they say my mic volume is too low after ve already adjusted the setting and have not had this issue with other mics great headset just wish the mic was better 
neutral,about weeks after return window closed quit working completely should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day spent lot of time fooling around with mouse tool that should be something you don have to think about or make plans to be available for use going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about year and no hassle 
positive,it was most important to me to have quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop this mouse has quiet silent scrolling and silent clicking very impressed the mouse is more of flat design the lights around it are pretty neat there is an on off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well nice mouse for great price 
neutral,starting using on april and when came back to my desk yesterday it had completely stopped working can not charge it tried on multiple computers and the computers won acknowledge it if it not plugged in directly which defeats the purpose of the wireless chargeable mouse don buy if you are looking for long term option and can find way to contact the company the only option amazon gives me is to leave review can not contact the seller 
positive,super cute mouse love the color and love the led lights my only issue is that it very glitchy like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn good sit at desk for hours and it completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own 
neutral,incredible sound 
neutral,left ctrl shift keyboard shortcuts are unresponsive on this keyboard meaning this is unusable for my workflow don know how this keyboard is rated so highly and continues to be sold with known hardware issues like this also the spacebar makes an awful twang noise when it tapped 
neutral,i wanted product that thought have for at least the semester since ve purchased it the ball that scrolls down up is no longer working makes mouse almost pointless to have seems am going to need new mouse 
positive,this is the first day of use but the mouse looks nice got flat black like that there are no batteries charged quickly and super easy to start using its light and fits my small hand nicely the lights are nice as well and not annoying like that they can be turned off don plan on using the mouse for gaming so will not know how well it works for that sort of thing for me just basic computer work photoshop lightroom and think it will do nicely for those it seems quick and is working well even without mouse pad think it was for sure worth the price so far its nice basic mouse think 
positive,i love sound
positive,update after six months the keyboard has died won hold charge any more my whole experience with this thing has been negative and would strongly recommend against buying one even if it is cheaper than when bought it original review when gave it three stars bought this primarily because wanted wireless backlit keyboard and this one lights up well only it goes off after only about minute and leaves me in the dark you of course only have to punch key to bring the lights back but it still interrupts my whole process when working it has nice touch which was why bought gaming keyboard even though don play games and would otherwise like the keyboard but this feature leaves me contemplating buying different brand drives me crazy 
positive,they are wonderful just one thing though everyone on the receiving end can hear everything going on around you 
positive,worked great for about months stays charged for long time and like being able to use the port in my laptop however now the scroll button moves erratic scrolling down the page and the page jumps up go up and it jumps down 
negative,when paired with my iphone pro max with speakers ok but when tried to paired to speaker the connectivity or bluetooth fail some time this happened with samsung and its worst 
positive,great portable mouse the color changing is fun and setup was easy lightweight ergonomic device it was also great value 
neutral,i like everything so far the really long cable can be plus when needed 
neutral,good
positive,i love the noise cancellation and quality of the head phones 
positive,the sound quality is perfect definitely the defining feature was playing fps where it was raining in game and had to stop to check if it was coming from outside the rest of the headset is easy to use for pc and console gaming would definitely recommend for any gamer
positive,worked okay for little while but then it became glitchy so bought one that plugs in works little bit better for now
positive,pretty good headset but not as loud as you would think and not good for extended gaming sessions get uncomfortable after awhile it would be stats if sound volume was abit better and abit more adjustable headpiece for comfort
positive,alot of people said the mouse was loud didnt work or what ever else its false the mouse is super quiet my mouse at work is loud and obnoxious this isnt the colors are great was sad cause it didnt turn pink lol but that is my only complaint its great mouse some of yall expect way too much from something cheep you get what you pay for but this mouse is great 
neutral,works as mouse should work 
positive,battery won charge guess you get what you pay for save the or whatever this cost is and invest in something better wow don trust these other reviews guys if you write bad review aka the truth they will ask you to delete it if the product doesn work obviously people are going to say something save your money people and buy from someone else that is better quality 
positive,these are fantastic the sound quality is amazing better than our multi thousand dollar home system of decades old high end speakers for those few who complain that the speaker is mono say of course how much stereo separation would you expect out of an inch system we re getting two more one for stereo separation in the great room the other to bring great sound to the master bath area 
positive,battery life was great worked great for while but it will not charge first time went to charge it plug it into my laptop and power brick it lights up for seconds then shuts off now it won turn on at all sadly would love to give this product more stars but now this is useless and can even use it while it plugged in 
neutral,i just got this mouse and doesnt even turn on after charging the usb plug does not work as well this just isnt good buy if was you would go for different one cause its waste of money so just save it and look for different one
positive,great headset ve paid much more for headsets in the past that weren as well made 
neutral,this lasts quite while before requiring plug in 
negative,i have never dropped it or damaged it in any way it barely leaves its shelf never listen on full volume yet the quality turned to absolute poopoo within the past year noticed it actually after months and it been getting worse the highs and mids sound sooo muddled and it hurts my ears because listen to rock metal electronic edm and others which are heavy on the percussion and need really good quality sound or it can be heavy on the ears literally appalled going to try to get it fixed by jbl hopefully they ll pull through and fix it because really sad and can return it anymore ahh 
neutral,i use it for work charged it and it last weeks easy to use and doesn jump around
positive,great
positive,i bought it for my grandson he was so excited and loves it he says that the sound is clear 
positive,colors are just ok have to position the charger certain way for it to actually charge 
positive, wish would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before purchased the white one don like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse assumed it would just be line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures if you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you overall do like the mouse and don want to deal with exchanging planned on getting the mint and should have gone with my instincts it glides smoothly and the clicks are slient won be returning it because do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown described
positive,my boys absolutely loved these great christmas present no complaints from them at all there was an adapter we had to get for them to work with xbox 
neutral,works good for child not for people with arthritis
neutral,sound wouldn go directly only into headphones customer service only cares about bad reviews with no intention to do the customer right 
positive,this was my second purchase bought one in june and it worked fine the charging port metal liner part fell out so it couldn be charged got another and used it for about an hour without any problems charged it used it for another hours then it just suddenly quit when turn it off and on again the red lights flash once then nothing completely useless 
neutral,yes 
positive,i have the jbl charge and now this and it works great perfect for use in out of our camper 
positive,very good headset the surround sound is really nice and they are great at noise cancellation
neutral,no complaints here will be purchasing again
positive,awesome very happy with the speaker sounds much better than my brothers bose mini ii portable speaker 
neutral,very cushioning and high qaulity 
positive,i haven played games in years was recently gifted google stadia and have started to casually play games with friends online wanted headset but was not ready to spend took chance on these and very pleasantly surprised ve had three hour gaming sessions with no discomfort sound is good thanks 
positive,impressive sound quality comfortable fit feels like sturdy well built device 
positive, really was waiting for use this mouse and everything ok great pink golden color amazing that is rechargeable and super ergonomic for edit my videos 
neutral,use for gaming noise cancellation could be better 
neutral,good
positive,it came in good condition and it has good sound
neutral,this is great mouse if only my cat would stop breaking them 
neutral,we use this in our gaming business and it seems to be doing good job 
neutral,good colors fast shipping
positive,we had one of these that we used so often we wore it out so we bought another and the sound is even better than the last one very pleased with our purchase 
negative,terrible stopped working within weeks the keys have weak feedback awkward placement of the enter key not to mention the weird noises the keyboard makes when the lights are on 
positive,i recently bought new chromebook and wanted wireless mouse to match came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it try cant say how good it works yet because never recieved the usb adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well otherwise its slim which is what wanted and like the lights on it
positive,these headphones work great for my ps 
neutral,great keyboard for room with low lighting
positive,it could easily just be me however found the headset to be to small around my ears and rather overly tight as well causing some discomfort that said the headset is beautiful and works perfectly 
neutral,charge last forever
negative,i liked the design of this product but after two weeks it stopped working kept having to turn it on and off to get it to track at all disappointed 
neutral,this is the second time buy it it has everything no need for battery you hock it up to laptop for charging and that it comfortable while holding it moving smoothly and got very appealing look bought another one from another brand and stopped working after awhile this one is the real deal and no more exploring other mouses sticking with it 
positive,quality on it is great although it doesn fully cancel out noise great for your first set of gaming headphones
negative,straight out of the package had issues but figured would hold on the mouse does not move smoothly cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly then it would stop and would have to jerk it around and now it has just stopped just upgrade spend little more on logi mouse and it is worth it 
neutral,got in and the mic doesn work 
neutral,not bad pretty smooth operation no delays in movement connects quickly to any lap top 
neutral,they re good headphones however the headphone jack constantly pops out and ve had to coat it in an adhesive to ensure it didn it annoys me very much especially when gaming 
neutral,meh it speaker it mono speaker and not an overly good one for bass for loudness think for should be getting something bit awesome had an anker speaker that is similar in regards to output
positive,i had been looking for gaming headset for my ps casual gamer and was looking for something that could use when play late at night read the reviews for this product and convinced me to buy when received it was surprised how big the headphones are but it wasn big deal when tried them on they felt comfortable and have been using them for long period of time and my ears have not gotten tired the sound quality is surprisingly good with good bass and can hear the surround sound effects of my games the voice chat quality is very good with clear quality in terms of noise cancellation it not true noise cancellation can still hear sounds form outside when playing but it minimal overall pleased with these headphones as they do their job just fine 
positive,like this mouse work good
neutral,everything
positive,this is great value mouse purchased it to go with my new laptop so didn have to depend on the trackpad the design is nice and colors are great addition 
positive,my laptop mouse was sticking ordered this bad boy does great and the battery life on this thing is unreal it last very long time the lights super cute 
neutral,i bought it for ps sadly you can use the led light unless you plug in the usb part but otherwise it nice headset haven tried out the mic 
positive,i like that it sounds noise cancellation really good what don like is that it heavy and too small tight for my big year old head cm or inches in circumferences gaming for long time like hours make you really dizzy aftereffect are bad headaches nausea and disorientation due to uncomfortable so don really recommends this for adults or kids with big head would like if this headphone extends bit more maybe like inch it would make the grip less so it won be uncomfortable 
neutral,i like the way the headphones feel and look it doesnt get better it was cheap and nice in quality 
neutral,as described
positive,great gift sound is great many colors to chose from definitely buy from them again
positive,tried to use this on work call with my laptop and on xbox for game session no one could hear me the mic has very low sound pick up also the microphone sits differently to the picture the picture makes it look close to the face mouth but when pulled into position you can not get it close to the side of your face let alone level with your mouth for sound the positive is that the lights are nice and they are comfortable on the ears 
neutral,i was super exited about this product for my laptop sadly it didn even work after week tried everything to get this mouse to work charging for two days try it on different computer nothing helped the mouse didn even use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements 
positive,i like the fact that you can recharge this mouse spend fortune on batteries and was looking for something could recharge and it works great 
neutral,the mouse worked great and then one afternoon as was working the middle center stopped working couldn use it to scroll up and down anymore not even two months old and it not working 
neutral,does the job 
neutral,after two weeks the cover just plain separated and couldn be snapped back on 
positive,i wish it had way to let me know when it needs to be recharged like how quiet it is and the lights are just fun 
positive,i liked how conveniently priced it was for good quality headset use it for gaming and streaming 
neutral,complete trash would not charge 
positive,great product works as advertised light and cool colors 
neutral,it looks nice lights up difficult to use since it freezes up the computer for some odd reason will even knock off my bluetooth headphones do not waste your 
positive,i use it lot had for over month no issues have gold and it cute very easy to maneuver 
positive,this mouse is completely useless the instruction manual has so many typos in it its not even proper english even the bottom of the mouse says for home and offlce use what see picture the usb receiver is hidden in the bottom of the mouse it doesnt come out see picture it needs to be plugged into the computer for the mouse to work but it doesnt come out tried everything tried to pry it out with my fingernail nope tried pen nope even tried to push it to see if it would pop out nope and of course the user manual doesnt explain anything dont waste your money like did 
positive,works great was gift for my mom she loves it
positive,i happy with my purchase it wasn an expensive mouse it wireless and rechargeable all things was looking for it is slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to only use it for office work tasks so can speak to other uses however don notice any lags delays or other issues do wish there was some way to control the colors but it not big deal also the top clear button clicks but haven figured out what that does 
positive,i was super excited when received this mouse with it comfort and of course the pretty led lights were cool it came fully charged worked great until after charged it for the st time strange it no longer worked could see bit of red inside but the led were gone and the curser wasn responsive to the mouse against better judgement agreed to receive free replacement giving it another chance so ll follow up with nd review follow up nd one worked for weeks and then stopped working altogether the company actually contacted me after submitting my initial review offering full reimbursement if take it down followed by instructions on how to do so didn end up doing it glad for it since this one was even worse ughhh why do companies insist on selling products like this 
positive, when opened my mouse noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse towards the area where your palm would rest when in use also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the usb that would make the mouse compatible with my macbook so had to use different adapter considering paid for new mouse was expecting to get better quality gave the mouse second chance and this time received one that didn work 
positive,this is the second ine purchased purchse one for me as work remotly and it was really good this one purchase it for my dad as he teaches online he loves them noise cancelling is amazing no regrets
positive,husband uses in his semi and it has worked out great for him 
neutral,sound is just okay and yes the sound only comes out of the right side initially thought one speaker wasn working but after reading reviews it is correct that the main sound is only on one side probably sending it back 
neutral,the sound for the headset it loud and there is no bass 
neutral,been trying this for over month now and have only used it handful of times because the charge barely last hours at most even after full charge save your money
positive,this was great value and the wireless mouse works well the colors are fun too just wish it had way to keep it on one color 
neutral,i would not recommend this mouse as it feels like the plastic will break on you at any second it very cheaply made and the light shines through the top layer of plastic which makes it look way worse 
neutral,worked fine then quit not much for longevity get what you pay for guess 
positive,this mouse arrived yesterday plugged it in for hours per the instructions and then started to use it it worked great once got off work turned it off and went about my merry way when returned and had to check on something tried to use it again and it is completely non responsive ve tried different usb ports unplugging and replugging the dongle and even charged it overnight to ensure that it had full charge it does not work was so excited for this mouse it slim and quiet which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that do while still getting some work done on my vacations but it not worth the money less than hours later and back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn going to work any longer 
neutral,type connector was bent unable to use is there way to get replacement type connector 
positive,great for kids that sit close 
positive,best portable speaker sound quality and battery life is awesome 
neutral,this mouse has wonderful feel to it and the lights are pretty however the first one broke not even five minutes into using it it stopped being able to click second one lasted one day the quit tracking pieces of junk am returning both 
positive,excellent product very easy to setup and use
positive,i absolutely loved my speaker the sound of my music gets me pumped when doing work so definitely recommend it
neutral,you won hear the annoying clicking sound from this mouse 
positive,i use this mouse with my laptop it worked pretty good when first got it then the wheel quit working have no idea why 
positive,the mouse worked great for just over month then the charging port detached from the mouse yes came right out no longer have the ability to charge it this was probably glitch with my individual unit otherwise would have given it stars 
positive,maintains the charge for long period don miss batteries nice size and easy use 
neutral,i ordered this for my husband our living room is small and this keyboard lags sooo much we ve ordered replacement and it just as terrible save your time and order elsewhere 
negative,purchased this keyboard for the office use back in may great keyboard quiet no delays battery lasted for about month at first then had to charge it every couple of weeks then every few days and now it died completely and cannot be used when plugged in very disappointed that it only last months 
positive,it really good in my opinion use it to play rust lot and it great 
positive,this came with an charging attachment but why this uses normal cell phone charger port and all the intuitions are in chinese theres random button at the top and when press it nothing happens and dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it other than that really like it so far its very sleek 
neutral,i loved this mouse until is stopped working after months 
neutral,i turn it up to max and it just not loud enough for me do however like the flowing pink on the sides 
neutral,the headset looks cool but the mic is too loud and muffled 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse it so quiet and love the different color lights as use it sal like how comfortable it is to use would definitely recommend this to everyone 
neutral,very quite no clicking noise and it stays lit up all day 
negative,you can barely hear your game gave up and just used my speakers on the computer monitor so could hear enemies and what not all these do is block noise like pair of lighted ear muffs they do not enhance game play in the least 
neutral,good for gaming
negative,i wanted to get wireless backlit keyboard for my home pc something could use throughout my office without having to be directly next to my computer this keyboard looks great the keys themselves have nice travel for easy typing and the charge lasts for very long period of time but the lack of an always on feature for the backlit is very annoying understand it always being on would kill the battery quickly but this is rechargeable keyboard so losing some time to have to charge isn big deal for me it just feels odd that they wouldn just add an always on function for those who would want that often reviewing other peoples work or just reading through instructions so often don type for seconds at time so the lights are constantly going off again understand the reason and it not huge problem but it just feels like it would have been so easy to have an always on function added overall good keyboard but unfortunately for me it just not good fit for how use my keyboard 
positive,they were decent headset for the price but they weren for me pros long cordglasses friendlysemi sound proofthe mic was pretty decent sounded like was in tunnel sometimes thoeasy to adjustcons did not fit well over my ears they were kind smallthe texture was also icky to me it felt like skate board wheels again my ears just squishythey don light up unless they are plugged into the pc but that really didn matter for meother that that they were pretty ok just not for me hence why return mine and try something else so if you wanna give them try still they may be great for you if not the return was as easy as heck 
positive,it great headset overall my son loves it 
positive,this is one of the best bluetooth speakers have used the battery life is amazing only have to charge it like once week and love that you can charge your phone with it also 
negative,after using this product for only about hour the wheel broke so you can not use that feature very poor quality would not recommend this product 
neutral,good speaker
neutral,packaging was terrible and the corner was broken where it plugs in to charge still work great though and the lighting is really vibrant 
negative,i ve used it times and it was fine and now it will not charge when plugged in shows red for about seconds and then nothing likes the mouse if it would work very disappointed in this product 
neutral,left button not working after months for not worth it save you money and look for better one the last 
positive,this keyboard works well my only complaint is the lights go off very quickly when you stop typing other than that its easy to recharge and looks good on my desk top 
positive,once followed the instruction for xbox to turn up my media in the home menu it was the best pair of headohines had just wish they were wireless however cord is long enough to anywhere with you
negative,it doesn work correctly connection is bad
positive,i bought this for my ps and it great headset with lot of utility for entertainment and chat would recommend to all 
positive,absolutely love the sound from this speaker 
positive,solid speaker and sounds fantastic but doesn sound all that far off from the great sound of its predecessor only upgraded only because had thought the sound would be improved by considerable margin waterproof feature was also big reason why needed one as this sounds incredible in pool scenarios asides form that not upset that bought this speaker 
positive,the bluetooth receiver works well can put it in the back of my computer and not have an issue with connection much quieter than my previous click clack old keyboard but it not silent it gets louder the more quickly you type as well but if you take your time it can be decently quiet no extra buttons need to press fn to use the secondary key commands but works well for my purposes just leave the lights on unless guests come over lol 
neutral,nice the only problem ve noticed so far is it really hard to click the scroll middle button it just really stiff 
positive,works grate love the base
positive,great sound it simplicity is it key it is meant to be an outdoor speaker and to fill up wider area so don listen to those who complain it not stereo stereo is useless if it speakers are so close together it not too big the accessories you can buy are good like the rubber carry case and the hard case as well
positive,nice speaker good range for bluetooth connection can go good ways away and it still works 
positive,i bought this mouse for my macbook and it would not even turn on charged it all day and it would not work or connect to my laptop it just flashed red color like the battery was dead and that was that happened save yourself some money and look for another mouse elsewhere should ve just gone to best buy or target 
neutral,great speaker bad order fillers ordered black speaker and got grey one the rest of my jbl speakers are black and they are not letting the grey one play any bluetooth speaker games 
neutral,mouse will not work have only had it for about days and the mouse just stopped working will not charge either 
neutral,don like
negative,box was open and the mouse was dirty like really it looks used and has so many gross black hard spots 
positive, like it easy to use and carry around if needed the box comes with nice short charging cord and usb usb adapter for use with either the bluetooth receiver or the charging cord nice addition that come in handy don like how long it takes for it to wake up though not sure what the time frame is on when it goes to sleep but if reading something or just have my computer on for video or music just turn the mouse off all together it quicker to just flick it back on than it is to jiggle it around to wake it rainbow colors are fun holds charge for long time can work pretty much the whole week before noticing its lagging and probably could use charge this makes it lot friendlier to use over batteries ll take the sluggish sleep mode over the clunky mouse styles with repeat battery replacements good find for the money 
positive,an attractive high performing speaker that exceeded my expectations first the bad news did have difficulty at first pairing my phone with the speaker the included instructions were no help and would have liked to see bit more detail it just series of what look like comic book panels begrudgingly downloaded the jbl portable app found bit more information and was able to pair straight out of the box the sound is bit disappointing the speaker did not produce much bass and was really heavy in the upper midrange and high frequencies would highly recommend downloading an equalizer app on your music source device now the good news the equalizer made this speaker come alive volume for days and more bass that would have expected for speaker this size the fact that it can also charge your music source device is even more reason to select this speaker 
neutral,out of the package my initial thoughts were that the product seemed very cheaply made and those thoughts were confirmed when after one month of use the product stopped working would not recommend this product 
neutral,appearance is bit different than was expecting also doesn glide smoothly and quickly enough on the screen not sure why sending back after day of use swiched to my old bluetooth mouse within hours
positive,i lost my usb receptor sent an email requesting help and their customer service rep lolita helped me they sent new one for free when received they provided me the instruction to pair my receptor points excelent servicekeyboard is awesome thanks klm 
negative,basicmisleading nothing special random usish logo offensive marketing per far too often 
neutral,i ve bought this headset multiple times now it is very good for the price but it has few problems the sound quality and microphone are good but the headset it not very comfortable for long gaming sessions and it is prone to breaking after constant use would recommend to anyone looking for cheap headset 
positive,this mouse is slimmer than others since have small hand it is very comfortable to use great buy 
positive,love the color great olive green sound is terrific 
neutral,everything you would expect from jbl speaker 
negative,not really worth it since the extra wires get in the way if your buying for xbox or playstation it terrible because not only do the lights not work but you need to plug the usb into your consol without plug for the usb it just gets extremely annoying to use the sound quality okay for the price 
negative,i use this mouse for my laptop only when travel after about times using it the scroll no longer works even when completely charged unfortunately with such little use didn have much time to notice the defect and the return window has closed wouldn recommend it 
neutral,hopefully they will do the right thing 
positive,love this headset has great quality and never glitches like my other one it great price and has amazing features recommend
positive,m daughter loves it 
neutral,so bought it because it was on sale for dollars that should have been my first hint the sound quality was terrible ve had better call quality on ham radio from the freinds said it echoed and had static sound and there is about football feild length of wire hanging on it that just irritating 
neutral,doesn stay charged
neutral,scroll wheel stopped working within days to long after return time all other features were good 
neutral,actually changed my mind on this mouse the one was using was driving me crazy because the clicking was so loud broke this one out of the box and it pretty cool it changes colors and it silent can work with the size being slimer 
neutral,it works very well with my macbook

positive,very smooth use love the different colors 
positive,love how easy it connects and the sound it superb don think just get it may get more 
neutral,stopped working after couple months

neutral,dissatisfied with purchase mouse works except for the scrolling wheel 
neutral,i bought this mouse for home use used it about two hours per day for two weeks then no connection thought it needed to be charged plugged it in and allowed to sit for two hours as instructed now there is nothing tried to charge longer but nothing is working do not buy this pos 
positive,this is an awesome mouse it is slender build so it fits small hand the lights are totally fun when you click the buttons it is strong click so that you know you have clicked on something it also has quick response on the computer it has an off on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won use up the batteries will be buying one for my daughter it is awesome 
positive,it fast and comfortable to use
positive,best bluetooth speaker yet
positive,i do lots of sidejobs and needed something loud and clear for long hard hours and this blew my expectations it small loud and crisp clear love me some 
positive,i had read other reviews and was excited to order and recieve my bengoo recently my neighbors have been having parties and playing music loud enough you could feel it shake the walls so was very eager to see the noise cancellation come into action as could relax while immerse myself in my game sadly it made no difference compared to my old headphones could still identify whatever song they play through the bengoo while playing games if you have an average pair of noise cancellation headphones you may want to seek premium brand of headphone though if you are seeking cheap option this is not bad option for first timers budget
positive,very nice affordable headset my son has no complaints 
positive,sounds so good plays for hours on single charge
positive,the sound is clear and crisp we often us it in our camper and outside around the fire pit we love this speaker

positive, feels great wide and comfortable lights up when you move around likes so much bought second one too 
positive,works great
negative,poor quality cheap breaks quickly doesn last long on full charge charging port already broke 
positive,this mouse is super clean looking and connects fast it not only recharges within hours but it lasts long time ve been using it pretty frequently for the past week and only charged it once it still going strong love how it lights up and it can be used on mac or windows computer very light and easy to transport as well 
positive,love it and the colors 
positive,great product
positive,nice mouse worked great for my needs glides smooth holds charge well 
positive,what really like is about these headsets is that it have metal plates on them which so they cannot break which is better than plastic plus the bands are not tight so it also doesn break easily the led is simple but unique in way as you can play games and watch youtube at night since you can glow and look pretty cool the sound quality is pretty good to me as hear better than my old ps headset the soft cushion fits on my head so that plus the wires are long which is really helpful when move away 
neutral,i didn receive all the accessories 
positive,not sure what to say except that these are the best headphones ve ever owned good quality sound and comfort 
positive,my son needed new headset because his mic stopped working and this was easy to install and works great he was able to install the headset himself and set it all up he very happy 
neutral,i enjoy the snarkiness of the ppwk in the package minus the space bar all of the keys are very quiet gave it full charge before use it worked immediately backlighting turns off after its idle for bit simple tap of any key wakes it up dig that the backlighting is multi colored just plain white being that not planning to use it for gaming going to need to get used to the shape of the enter key there is an additional key on the middle row where would naturally hit enter no biggie minus star because the space bar is quite loud 
positive,love the color and sound quality
positive,my grad daughter loves this keyboard she purchased with her grad money the price was right and shipped was fast 
neutral,nice mouse but would not charge after single use tried with the usb on the computer other usb chargers even switched their cord out 
neutral,this mouse feels good in the hand looks cute as all get out but did not last month after charging only once have had issues with it being sluggish and not holding charge 
positive,i was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when received it couldn have asked for more for the money it comfortable in my hand the rubber texture really makes using it pleasure the dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn covered but it nice and tight so not worried about losing it so far so good 
positive,mixes really well with the whole game experience from footsteps to bullets highly recommend this product for your gaming needs 
positive,i loved this product when first received it it lit up and lightweight and just pretty but that was very short lived it stopped working after just weeks of using it good thing it was on the cheaper side maybe it was disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for short period 
negative,i used it for about month and then the sensor broke and the entire thing is useless now
positive,upgraded from the flip so far very happy with my purchase only now want bigger and louder speakers extreme next we will see 
positive,was trying to find mouse for my new laptop and came across this mouse the best one ve found like that it smooth and the color is super nice 
negative,worst mouse ever it double clicks when do not want it to the mouse barely moves and is jerky when used and often makes the cursor slide to the upper right of the screen without me moving the mouse 
neutral,not worth the value
neutral,mic tends to go in and out on occasion
positive,after using it for couple hours on its initial charge plugged it in using the given charging cable but it would never charge plugged it in to my computer the wall and with different usb charger and nothing worked cannot recommend anyone to purchase this product when it does not charge properly if it worked would have given it star review because it looks nice has rgb and had very little latency despite being wireless do not buy this product 
negative,this product has been advertised as having led capability and it does but the lights are not bright enough that was the whole entire purpose of what had purchased this set for disappointing and considering beginning return plus the led lights engineered into this unity are barely colored purple and that is what classify as entirely weak kneed lackadaisical engineering prowess disappointing 
positive,we are obsessed with these speakers we had smaller one for about years and decided to upgrade to the larger speaker best quality and price 
neutral,i use this for my laptop speaker great sound but the power is not always easy to maintain used my docking station and it has been struggling when finally move to real charger it works great 
negative,absolutely ridiculous watching the side panels go off with all this bass bass is okay out of and everything else sound like it inside tin can mono speaker ruins this product horribly 
positive,love it 
positive,also good for adults nighttime joy 
positive,i needed new mouse because the one had been using was so old and was unreliable this new one is so nice for such great price it fits my hand comfortably and has super quiet clicks which is super nice it charges instead of using batteries which is feature that love so excited to keep using this product 
neutral,very comfy and nice looking headset
neutral,there were no instructions with the mouse 
neutral,i use this for my laptop needed silent wireless mouse it wireless and silent the roll ball button is loud like regular mouse but left and right are quiet charged it used it once the next day tried to charge it and cut it on it wouldn come on or the red light flashed and immediately went off wouldn buy this 
neutral,there were no instructions with the mouse 
neutral,i drop it once and it just completely breaks
neutral,i like everything
neutral,i like how it is
negative,the tested latency was ms this keyboard also goes to sleep every seconds dont know if you can change this the deal killer for me was the space and enter key they were horrible extremely mushy ive been around keyboards since windows know what im talking about 
positive,these are very easy to set up and sound incredible easy to link several together also
positive,bought this for my teenagers who loves music great sound portable and great charging option highly recommend 
neutral,this mouse was very dissapointing it was hard to use and finally after couple of months it broke completly 
neutral,no issues love the color works great for discord 
positive,the price is worth getting but find it kind dumb that you need to be right by your console to connect and turn on the lights but good headphones to start tho 
neutral,if you want to have to charge mouse more than use it this product is for you had moderate hopes but this mouse falls short of even those
positive,the usb plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port can pull the usb out but the case stays inside the port it still useable if put it back in though it also has very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves especially when it used close to the usb plug it is not silent that for sure have to use music or headphones when use this mouse or it drives me insane it shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand but have arthritis so usually need thicker taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable but bought this mouse as backup for my work laptop so don use it as much as use my gaming mouse like that you can still use it when it plugged in to charge if you use longer cable 
positive,the headset arrived the next day excellent quality and very good performance my son was super happy 
neutral,it doesn come with the charger cord it claims to have just opened the box let see how it operates once find charger cord for it won waste my money here again
positive,love it 
positive,loving the fact that the sound quality is this amazing also beyond thrilled that can wear them for hours and not have to worry about them hurting my ears when wearing them have size gauged ears so it is awesome overall very happy with my headphones 
neutral,the first mouse did not work however was sent gift certificate for my trouble the other mouse same model works greateasy to find because of the lights
positive,ordered shortly after christmas and once arrived had issues connecting after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off after less than week and one charge it will no longer do anything no lights no power no connection and won charge with the included cord or any other spend the money on different brand this was like ordering from wish 
neutral,didn work from the minute opened it don waste your money 
positive,sensor doesn always pick up movements to clarify am not using this gaming but as wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate sometimes when sit for too long the sensor takes time to come back online andreas movements this can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from mouse overall you are doing menial office tasks this is probably an okay mouse the rechargeable batter is cool and am happy to not have to replace batteries but would probably go with wired mouse in the future 
positive,if you get white mouse be prepared that you could get one that actually looks solid like it should or transparent like the one got guess sure it pretty interesting that instead of only the perimeter of the mouse lighting up the entire thing does but at the same time it takes the focus away from the design for the rgb it makes the mouse look cheap being able to see the skeleton of the plastic interior it even feels like mouse it only doubled the price tag bc of obvious to see rgb leds would ve liked it more if the leds at least blended colors but with an obvious wall of plastic in the way they don even do that despite its looks the mouse worked great for couple days the movement felt smooth the clicking felt good and it was quiet noticed the red laser id not shielded at all also the rgb lights stay on even when the mouse falls asleep and unfortunately after few days noticed the movement isn very good it may be okay for normal use but it not acceptable for gaming thought it was because of the low battery power but even at full power and changing the dpi around the issue remains this is gonna have to be returned 
positive,this is by far the best portable speaker that have ever purchased have another speaker that thought was good one but it was lacking volume and clarity once compared it to this one this unit keeps long charge and can charge my phone also 
positive,pros the physical design of the keyboard is great feedback on the keys is good has nice matte finish lights are as advertised and there are holes on the back of the keyboard which helps keep the keys clean and if you spill liquid on it it can drain cons couple times days the keyboard will disconnect intermittently on me it will become unresponsive and disconnect then reconnect rapidly its not for very long maybe seconds to couple minutes and if at the computer for hours day it will only happen couple times but if in the middle of game it can be quite frustrating never have had this issue with other wireless keyboards not sure what the solution is but tried reinstalling the driver 
neutral,good
positive,this is great little mouse it is small responsive and love the way the light changes colors my hand is more relaxed when using it than with my previous mouse have had no issues with it so far overall based upon my experience thus far this was good purchase and would buy it again 
neutral,i purchased this for my office work and it broke down after weeks the scroll wheel stopped functioning be aware of this and look for something else with better quality thanks
positive,love the lighted background makes finding keys in low or no light situation wonderful price was good to for quality of product

positive,love the product will probably order another color 
positive,pretty good mouse for when do school work
neutral,basic mouse at reasonable price 
positive,works on phone laptop tv all that pretty cool and lights up so wahoo
neutral,this mouse is much faster than my last few like the charging system drawback is when the charger comes missing and it will happen in my house how to replace it 
positive,i was looking forward to not having to use batteries and not have to worry about wires it was great at first and really liked it then after about week the charge did not even last day and then it quit even charging don waste your money the only silver lining is that had used my reward points so there was no out of pocket 
neutral,lots of bass
neutral,these are very good quality headphones
neutral, its an okay mouse disliked how cheap it appears because the rose gold color got was light spray on top and there are distinct areas where the light is shining through also disappointed that when turn the color changing led off but keep the mouse on that its constant red color which was not in the description it also goes into sleep mode quickly and takes good seconds to reconnect which is frustrating 
neutral,ergonomic for gaming
neutral,literally had this for less than months and suddenly can hear anything 
positive,great sound very light for head set
neutral,really underwhelmed by this and the charge not lot of clarity and bass seemed too heavy was far more impressed by the flip 
positive,great headset for this price picks up very little background noise 
positive,great base and sound jbl best quality 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse super handy dandy because not only does it work with my mac it also works with my work laptop which is dell the only thing don like about it is that if you don use it for while it shuts off mean it great because it saves energy so you don have to charge it often but meh ve yet to charge it again used it for days for at least hours each day 
negative, bought this mouse as backup to keep in my laptop bag and foolishly didn try to use it until the return window had already passed it has never worked threw away my money ve tried syncing this mouse to multiple computers and devices with the same results nothing can find any info about the switch on the bottom or how to troubleshoot but when plug the mouse in to charge it it illuminates blue when actually try to use it it blinks red and shuts off it has never worked please don waste your money please learn from my mistake 
positive,mouse is easy to use and works well however the first time put it in my bag the color chipped off the mouse now have teal mouse with white specks super disappointed
neutral,it says it is supposed to install hardware automatically and should work once completed however that is not the case for mine and it doesn tell me what should be installed for me to try to find it on my own
neutral,don waste your money it worked well for few weeks long enough to miss the return window but then got jumpy erratic and wouldn hold charge unless plugged in 
neutral,the scroll wheel broke after only month 
positive,have to charge it twice day at least it is not comfortable too small to fit nicely in my hand the flow is choppy the cursor sticks it feels cheap like it is going to break at any second 
positive,i like the fact that it turns off after some time like that it works with usb and like that can use it with my mac or my pc and like the charging cable 
neutral,had an issue they sent me the wrong color first time as well as faulty headset that had audio issues they promptly handled the issue and have to say for the price point it good headset
positive,i have been needing wireless mouse for the longest and this product was definitely what was looking for nice sleek feel and has long battery life so glad bought it 
positive,this is the second we have one in the garage and this one in the gym easy to pair and use and great battery
neutral,the price point is good but these are functional hut not comfortable 
positive,love the color changing led lights easy to use easy to charge lets see how long it last
neutral,excelente 
positive,this is nice sleek little mouse very pleased with the size and the connection range was looking for one that wasn too clunky but still looked decent this definitely fits the bill all the awesome colors is just plus for my own personal amusement also if you don want the lights all the time there is setting for that too good little mouse for the price 
neutral,i bought of these back in october for me and my mom after month and and half of regular use for mine it no longer works thought wasn charging it enough until opened my mom hers brand new out the box did not work either very very disappointed will not be purchasing again do not but it isn worth it 
positive,i like this speaker it really has terrific range paired it with my computer and took it all the way to the back of the house and around the corner and it still great my one big complaint if you re paying this kind of money for speaker they can include charging cord with it have to buy separate one really 
positive,i would recommend to anyone if you play ps or this is just the best and great item
positive,it all fun and cute at the beginning but after month in half past my refund window and it has stopped working tried charging it nothing extremely disappointed 
positive,really don care for this product it seems to constantly be acting up for example was just trying to type an address and all my numbers appeared as if had been holding the shift key 
positive,the battery doesn even last one day pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and have the light setting turned off it looks like nice mouse and the wheel and clicking is fine but what the point if it never charged don waste your money on this mouse 
positive,comfortable and easy to use the sleep feature is convenient because you do not need to charge as often 
neutral,we bought this for my son as gift and after the excitement he went to use them they have low sound no noise cancellation just horrible headset the only thing it good for is aesthetics

positive,bigger and heavier than my sonos roam but sounds little better and it cheaper plus you can charge devices from it 
positive,it great mouse perfect and just what was looking for it really quiet which appreciate because louds clicks do get annoying after some time but not with this mouse the lights are cool too really slim so it easy to pack in my work bag and it feels great while using it

neutral,product has ceased working after years it doesn seem to take charge anymore disappointing

positive,great price and service
positive,overall sound is good but doesn get very loud almost certain my flip was louder and more even in sound this would be good with another to run in stereo but the bass is still lacking unless you put it in spot with lot of sound deflection or corner 
neutral,the keyboard is great in general but the usb receiver broke off in my usb port after months they really should either include more than one receiver or make them more robust and of higher quality

positive,great for the price
positive,great to use quite clicks and looks very cool

positive,i was amazed at how light it is and requires no batteries the functions of the keyboard are simple to use and having options for the lighting is awesome super comfy keyboard on the flip side thought you could change the color settings but that no it not silent more than the character keys are quiet but the spacebar is normal clicking sound and connecting it to phone charger is preferred to plugging it into your pc to charge the pc might get bit confused great product guys and love the schwag 
neutral,ps and to tune out my little sister and brother
positive,it works great as of now would definitely recommend
neutral,not bad for the price 
neutral,thanks
positive,puts out great sound durable battery life hood 
positive, was actually about to return the mouse bc it stopped working and couldn find where to replace the batteries had thrown out the box and prob the instruction booklet can remember if it actually came with instruction booklet went to amazon and read the product detail and saw that it rechargeable mouse using usb cable like it small lightweight and comfortable it fit perfectly in my hand and when resting on top of the mouse the mouse didn feel bulky or heavy like the colors changing pretty coollike not battery operated you can charge using standard usb cable like and dislike read that there is silent option to mute click sound have not found it to test but like that there is the option to take the mouse silent after trying to research how to make the mouse silent have still not been able to do so like maybe great that there is sleep mode not sure where to find it or if have really cannot tell the difference the options in the back are off on and something that looks like sun when on the on option think think it in sleep mode bc the light turns red and then turn off but when on the sun mode the lights change dislike when using the mouse at first there are no issues this is the same experience if the mouse is used with usb cable or wireless randomly the mouse will then lag and get stuck needed to turn power on and off few times aside from the minor issue of latency and turning the mouse on and off it ok got this mouse as second mouse bc the original mouse purchased was taken by my son it is def for the more casual user surfing the internet or checking on ems if trying to use for work get mouse little bit more sturdy and reliable 
positive,product works great love it 
positive,great speaker

neutral,first and foremost have had this keyboard almost year now the first keyboard received was doa which anyone who knows much about electronics knows that that is just how it is sometimes contacted their customer support and within week had new keyboard initially this was amazing and saw no issues but as time went on it stopped charging properly believe am on my computer long hours every day as work from home and then game at night if charge it at night with the keyboard set to off it lasts the whole day normally even then sometimes it doesn but overall it does other times even while it is plugged in it shuts off randomly making gaming hard if klim were reading this would suggest two things add some way to show battery charge on the keyboard and upgrade the battery stability this keyboard after year is acting like the one that was faulty did just year later for those who are reading this would suggest this keyboard unless you use it hours day it simply isn built for that it feels like 
neutral,nice
neutral,my only issue is the color changing lights thought there would be an option to turn the led lights off have the light be one color anything but nope it disco the whole time not bad thing guess but also not great 
neutral,had it for one month and not working

positive,the headphones are used by my son mainly for his classes they are very comfortable to spend lot of time listening to them without being distracted by external noises he also uses it for games he does not need to be connected to his pc he can listen to his classes away from home or even camping connected to his smartphone he is very happy with these 
positive,not sure how widespread problem it is but this headset is super uncomfortable on my ears to wear other than that the sound quality and mic on it is superb 
positive,garbage bought my niece new hp for college plugging the usb in laptop mouse cause the laptop not to work mouse moves really slow or don move at all thinking it was the laptop took the laptop back got brand new one same issue but when took the ian out and used my store bough best buy mouse works perfect no problems be careful with this mouse and plugging it into your laptops

positive,best little speaker
positive,at first was happy with the product but now when try to click links have to press super hard to get it to work will probably return it 
positive,awesome
positive,just got this last night for my new acer when plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around with usb or usb plug it zig zags across the screen when trying to move in straight line it stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it overnight and same results this morning adjusted the dpi with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen tried troubleshooting but can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works 
neutral,so all in all for this thing is fine the rgb is not actually rgb instead featuring the average rgb rainbow cannot customize the coloration just the brightness and the pattern pulse breathing something along those lines all that said this is fine budget option clicky bois beware this is not very tactile prefer it that way but know many dont
neutral,plugs didn work for computer or phone very quiet when they would work
neutral,worked right out of the packaging cute inexpensive

positive,love that this is so colorful works great with my mac
positive,i absolutely love everything about this
positive,shipment time was good product is as listed couldn be happier 
positive,i ordered this after my very old hp wireless keyboard decided to tap out on me with few of the keys just no longer working at all since my family member didn want to spend the on can of compressed air to fix it so tried few ways to see if it could be fixed trying few other tips on my own as it was bit grimy dirty but unfortunately for whatever reason the keys still wouldn work so figured why not purchase brand new one after searching on amazon my eyes were immediately drawn to this one to be honest so far am really liking this keyboard especially the colored lighting when it hits nighttime talk about really nifty idea so far love it the one downside have with this keyboard though is the fact that it has to be charged using charger to connectto my wireless pc when needed unfortunately need to disconnect my separate wireless mouseconnector in order to charge up the battery for the keyboard as my pc only has usb ports on the left side from what can tell as don know if it might have few more usb ports in the very back which is bit of possible small letdown but am sure ll get used to it overtime with that said it arrived in timely quick manner am super excited to begin using it gonna hope that itwill last as long as it does 
negative,great mouse overall but the middle click button needs lot of pressure to click which is quite annoy other than that would have given it star 
positive,i use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing but does what it supposed to do great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand
positive,this wireless mode has nice sleek design purchased the matte design love that the clicks are quieter than others didn think it mattered that much but it does no problems with cursor speed or connectivity enjoy the change of colors feels more expensive than it actually is excellent price 
positive,got this to match the skin works great
positive,i loved this mouse when first got it it moves nicely and the colors around the base is awesome could tell it was cheaply made but didn think more of it just went to use it now and the scroller in the middle is busted it rotates but it doesn do anything on my computer 
neutral,there is supposed to be charger included no charger or even user manual was included 
neutral,we use them for gaming
neutral,i really liked the idea of rechargeable mouse but the wheel button stopped working after days and it is needed for my job and the programs use guess got what paid for 
positive,i loved the product 
positive,i love this mouse got the pink gold rose one it first of all so elegant and the best part is that it mute the clicks are soft and smooth 
positive,headset is super comfortable and does good job tuning out the noise of the outside world it works great with my mac and android device if the case is removed absolutely love the sound quality
neutral,it works lasting charge but it is flimsy used for like weeks no problem cool lighting but im not sure how will it will hold up
positive,i purchased this keyboard because it was wireless and it claimed it would be great for gaming with fast response time that my friends is joke when can actually get the keyboard to turn on it takes several moments for it to reconnect it goes into sleep mode all the time and getting they keys to respond is extremely hard do not in any way recommend this keyboard it also says feet your lucky to get feet before you start having connectivity issues 
positive,i was super excited to use this mouse for my macbook but it won even charge would return but do not have the packaging anymore do not buy 
positive,the mouse worked for couple weeks but now the scroller just spins freeling and won scroll one through pages really disappointed because the mouse as whole worked pretty well for the last couple weeks hopefully just defective model will be returning the item and seeking replacement
neutral,a good purchase and delivery
neutral,works just like figured plenty loud
neutral,i bought this for working at home general use was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when didn have any works great for general use and battery lasts while but haven done any button mashing games with it my only complaint is the usb remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage you have to dig with your nail to remove it small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse 
positive,i own of these now as purchased the second specifically because jbl advertises that you can link up to something like of these together to all play the same music wanted that for my backyard while this speaker sounds great on its own found the process of connecting it my original jbl speaker to be very challenging and it keeps cutting in and out very choppy 
neutral,cheap broke after months
positive,i got this because our child sleeps while work the mouse is super quiet pro quiet lef right buttons adjustable sensitivity micro usb is easy to charge and doesn interfere with mouse use color changes usb doesn disconnectcons middle button click is louder color can be set it rotates it be cool if could lock it in for this price it pretty good purchase 
positive,alot of people said the mouse was loud didnt work or what ever else its false the mouse is super quiet my mouse at work is loud and obnoxious this isnt the colors are great was sad cause it didnt turn pink lol but that is my only complaint its great mouse some of yall expect way too much from something cheep you get what you pay for but this mouse is great 
positive,battery life was great worked great for while but it will not charge first time went to charge it plug it into my laptop and power brick it lights up for seconds then shuts off now it won turn on at all sadly would love to give this product more stars but now this is useless and can even use it while it plugged in

positive,this keyboard is great you want wireless keyboard ranging from gaming to office work this is the one for you the only downside can think of is it not bluetooth but other than that ita fantastic now stop thinking about getting it and just get it 
positive,i ve tried so many wireless mice over the years and one of the most annoying has always been how quickly the battery dies and they are not included when ordered this mouse got it because it lit up and matches my laptop when got it was pleased to learn it was rechargeable mind blown and brilliant the mouse will go into sleep mode when you aren using it or you can turn it off and on easily perhaps the only con is that it doesn come with instructions absolutely love this mouse and highly recommend it 
neutral,i just use it as regular mouse 
neutral,at home for personal use
positive,just love the narrow band of changing colors around the mouse it so cheerful 
neutral,it broke within days of having this mouse accidentally dropped it as was picking up the mouse and my computer it cannot sustain fall from less than feet definitely did enjoy it for the days had it 
positive,great headphones 
neutral,works just fine affordable price for decent gaming headset 
neutral,i like that it does not need batteries the battery lasts long time 
neutral,the mouse has nice small design and like how it feels when you click but unfortunately the hardware is not high quality the charging port has stopped working 
positive,i was debating between the jbl charge and different version of the jbl and so glad went with this one the sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely jbl speakers on amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop the quality is amazing and it so load for how small it is this one doesn come with case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality haven had any issues or scratches and ve just been throwing it in tote bag the charging port for your phone is so nice too and chargers relatively fast if you re debating between this one and pricier one would go with the charge 
positive,nothing wrong with this honestly
neutral,i like it
neutral,horrendous mic quality constantly getting muted by teammates for it don spend the money on wish com quality headset
neutral,only used it few times and like it 
negative,not bad for the money but keys are very stiff and not ideal for typing prolong use will cause finger and wrist pain wanting to find quieter alternative for my razer mechanical keyboard but this one does not cut it it is quiet though

negative,horrible piece of trash worst mouse ever don buy this 
neutral,the scroll feature on the mouse broke weeks after the return period otherwise like it 
positive,cord is too long but still good
neutral,not work good 
neutral,this is not compatible with hp or google chrome devices 
neutral,i haven had them long but they work really well mostly use them for work 
neutral,i love everything about this headset the only misleading thing is the box shows that it lights up but it doesnt
positive,and im still using this its so good and like the lights really good cheap headset for gaming also the microphone sound is so good too 
positive,love it the rose gold color is so cute and it lightweight loves the light change works great for me 
neutral,it keeps shaking 
positive,great most for extended casual use love that can recharge it and use it at the same time so there no down time or waisted batteries

positive,i feel like pro gamer who gets no citches when have these on nd they my favorite color to on cripp
neutral,this broke after day 
positive, great mouse the best for the price 
positive,the mouse works great until it goes to sleep agggh then you have to shake tap hard against your palm so you don smash it to pieces or flip the switch back and forth it quite irritating if it was as simple as on and off it would be perfect 
positive,it good but for gaming don recommend this slim one it ok for normal work 
neutral,would not recommend these to anyone they are too small and put way to much pressure on your ears lights are just gimmick she your money and search around for something better 
positive,bought this for an office laptop it works great 
neutral,very good speaker
negative,it was initially pretty decent keyboard but after few months things started going wrongthe spacebar started sticking in the pressed state and after about year it stopped recharging and it keeps turning off and on with every key pressprice is in par with quality guess disappointment nonetheless
positive,this is for young kids don buy as an adult piece of garbage so quiet can hear anything and built poorly definitely budget headset ve bought better headsets from below for bucks 
neutral,the microphone stopped working after the th day sent them back and bought another brand 
neutral, was in the market for new mouse as my logitech wireless was going bad on me was red to stay wireless and had budget the logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when wanted one that looked cool and the cheaper ones were too normal looking got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were cool feature got it and it feels great it feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn have the typical mouse click sound edit had to get other mouse as my first broke it was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident since it was so cheap just bought another and it works as well as the first 
positive,i like the color chose and the quality of sound and fits in my luggage when traveling very important my travel life it must
positive,super loud plug in cover flap to make it water proof love it 
positive,i love this mouse it fit feels great in my hand on the computer lot so that is important to me love the colors as you can tell by my mouse pad love colors it easy and fast to wake it great don have negative thing to say 
negative,good size and shape but unfortunately the scrolling wheel broke un the first month 
positive,it easy to use and works well there is no loud clicking when using it to get it to change colors you must push the on button all the way up to the top and it changes color when you touch it which find pretty cool
negative,right out the box you can hear perfectly but couldn be heard it said my microphone was on and making noise but no one could hear me did not glow blue at all cord was already lose and when you move it sound would jump and go in and out
neutral,very nice and sturdy just heavy on head 
neutral,the key board has very cheap construction it has major hardware flaw where ctrl shift keyboard combinations do not function properly from the left side of the keyboard it is much smaller than my previous logitech wireless keyboard that broke the cord it comes with is way too short so had to spend another buying longer cord the rgb lighting effects are very sub par they don stay on continuously and only have one alternate effect of breathing otherwise the color effect is stationary and never moves the keyboard is so light if wants to slide when using it so you might also have to buy keyboard pad next time think ll spend and extra for better ergonomic quality gaming keyboard 
neutral,i gave it two stars because like glowing lights can you tell child of the if could give it zero stars for function would this mouse has lot of good reviews maybe mine is fluke it is however fairly horrible the charge on the battery is extraordinarily short lived and when charged it sort of sucks then too 
negative,mouse never worked with usb adapter flashes once red and never connects clearly cheap construction and plastic not even sure it charges properly glows blue briefly and then turns back off 
positive,bought for my niece for my birthday she loved it
positive,loved the look and feel of this mouse but after only weeks of school the usb completely came apart when pulled it out of my son chromebook there was no impact or anything to cause this and the kiddo was quite upset that it broke because he loves the look of this mouse as well as how it feels in his hand 
neutral,this valid
positive,amazing quality and comfort for the price the microphone quality is outstanding as well 
positive,this mouse is very comfortable and ergonomic it is also very silent the led lights are very calming love it recommended 
neutral,this mouse will randomly move the cursor all over the screen every once in while not going to bother returning it because it was so cheap but have stopped using it bought two and they both have this issue 
positive, its awesome
neutral,this item has already stopped working it was purchased in may
neutral,its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse only downside is when don move the mouse for while you have to click the button to wake it up sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something didn want to click on or open update it died months later not worth it 
neutral,scroll wheel stopped working within days to long after return time all other features were good 
positive,good price funky colors clearly starts stuttering in response time when it ready to be charged perfect for my tiny home office kitchen counter space 
positive,can believe use to waste my money buying cheap portable speakers this one is great its loud bass sounds amazing and with hours of battery life can throw away my portable charger 
negative,light weight ergonomic bought on died on impossible to recharge
positive,perfect no comment everything is pretty good
positive,really comfortable around the ears and very light headset the mic and sound works perfect and for the price it worth buying
neutral,worked well for the first few weeks then broke right after return window closed 
negative,this mouse really only worked for about two months now it seems to need to be charged more frequently takes long time to charge and does not move smoothly it sort of sticks to the point that it is very annoying to use 
positive,awesome its has really nice base very loud for its size
neutral,broke did not work
neutral,loved this mouse at first had zero problems with it however now it will not stay on it has charged over night but as soon as take it off the charger to use it it dies it will not turn on and am not able to use it guess you get what you pay for 
neutral, sleek design and very responsive and most all it sleeps when you re not using it 
positive,this product is everything that they claim it to be it has excellent sound awesome bass and is very east to connect via bluetooth it holds charge for hrs and takes just couple of hrs to fully recharge
neutral,a 
positive,i would like to say very upset and won get another one like was going to lot of crashes on it
negative,i love the way the mouse looks and feels but oh the mistakes make this mouse has mind of it own and jumps all over the place have accidentally closed files programs while working on them move public folder and having to contact it to move back and many more random errors as result of this erratic mouse sometimes while not even using the mouse can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen perhaps there is ghost in the machine but if so they are hostile will be replacing it asap 
neutral,my only issue is the color changing lights thought there would be an option to turn the led lights off have the light be one color anything but nope it disco the whole time not bad thing guess but also not great 
positive,i wanted to find slim wireless mouse similar to mac magic mouse without the high price tag while this certainly isn magic mouse it pretty good substitute for fraction of the cost there are some tradeoffs of course due to the slim nature of this mouse it is extremely lightweight not built like tank and sometimes the buttons require sturdy click to ensure response but all in all happy with my purchase it looks nice works well and it has gone about months so far without needing recharge speaking of which leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode no big deal just realize you need to click button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop otherwise it will seem like the mouse isn working also ve had couple of instances where had to reinsert the usb adapter to get it to reconnect but that was maybe times in the past couple of months in short recommend this product the company provided great support when received the wrong color mouse and they ve been top notch to deal with they stand behind their product 
neutral,do not buy
neutral,junk would not charge after days of use sticking to battery operated 
positive,works as intended the lights are pretty but bit bright use it from across the room with no issues and the battery life has been excellent even with me forgetting to turn it off 
neutral,poorly made
neutral, 
positive,good buy it lisent very good and good quality
positive,got this for my son for his birthday he loved it it works great and looks awesome my son said he can hear anything from the outside so the noise cancellation is legit the sound quality is very clear and hasn had any problems used it for his xbox one
neutral,it lightweight colorful and it charges using usb no more changing out batteries love that it does go into sleep mode when haven used it for period of time meaning it just idling haven found out how to wake it up so just flip it over switch it off and on back again to resume using it 
positive,hi have purchased this product for my daughter so happy with the overall looks and performance will recommend you to buy great buy 
positive,for this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used set it up in two minutes feels good in my hand the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent cannot stand loud clicking mice got this for my work computer and think also going to get one for my laptop 
positive,i love this mouse cause it has really cool lights and really like that it petite and lightweight 
neutral,the scroll wheel doesn work
positive,i found this mouse to be too small for my hand and not large person by any means it might work for child but found that my thumb kept blocking the left button changing lighting was just distracting although might have become used to it if could actually get the left mouse button to work it is also too flat for good ergonomics hand at rest is normally more arched than this mouse allows 
positive,the sound quality is battery life is awesome and is easy to connect to bluetooth it also easy to pack up and take trips with got the red one and the color is beautiful the pictures does not do it justice overall great product by great company 
positive,overall love this mouse the size weight clicking is all fabulous however ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use it wasn dropped literally was not even touching it the second time and heard it fall if you need to use the middle scroller lot do not recommend purchase if you don use that feature then it great mouse 
positive,absolutely love it
positive,i like it ergonomic sleek and sleep mode is great 
positive,bought this mouse in january and fully charged it the same day got it until this day as am writing this review haven recharge it not once must say use it fair amount of time not to full extent everday but do use it really like the sleep mode that preserve the battery whole lot because sometimes just get up leave it and go out on the road spend few hours and come back and it still here doing great feel pretty satisfied with what payed for this didn expect it to hold up like this but give thanks five stars for this 
positive,i got this one flash sale so it was much bigger than thought but its really great dont have blue tooth in my car so use this 
positive,this keyboard is the best purchased of them for work and my son schooling 
neutral,i in the process of trying to find replacement keyboard for the logitech and this ain it either tried another keyboard before this one and it didn cut it at all the illumination on this klim is worse than the deluxe tried first with the brightness turned all the way up and the keyboard freshly charged it is very dim and hard to read especially all around the outside edge of the keys keyboard another minus is that every time you stop typing it turns off the illumination yes it does come back on when you start typing but when you can see which keys are which it hard to find the correct key to press without messing up your work it is also fairly small keyboard little bigger than the deluxe but not much once again the old adage you get what you pay for comes into play still looking 
neutral,within couple of weeks from purchase the connection seems to cut out no one can hear me and can hear anyone trying to play video game not can you hear me now 
positive,son loves it 
neutral,full charge lasts two hours or less if you want to use it all day you have to charge it three to five times and of course can use it while it charging buying different wireless mouse today 
positive,this is the first mouse have bought for my new pc probably the best purchase have made for my pc it great to use anywhere it so quiet and smooth looking it fits in the palm of my hand nicely the colors are bit off but great for how cheap it was really like that it was cheap too but it wasn cheaply made or seemed like it recommend it was bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my pc do have both usbc and usb on here but keep in mind that if you have usb pc you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse its hard to get it out of though do save the box for the usbc connector and charger 
positive,a lot of people were jumping on this speaker for the fact that it is mono speaker and just wanted to stand up for it you can hardly tell the difference between the and the unless you stand very close the two stereo speakers in the charge are just so close together it doesn really matter and the difference is small the sound quality is definitely improved however the mid and highs are not muddy like the and the bass is slightly deeper making very enjoyable sound experience the only gripe have about it is that it cannot be speakerphone or connect with siri or google assistant but that is minimal compared to the improvement of sound quality if you have the don upgrade it still isn worth it but if you are deciding between getting the or the get the 
positive,easy to use it took less than second to install it comes with charger connecter didn need to use it take the piece from under the mouse and put it directly in the computer turn mouse on and use real comfortable to my hand sleek bright colors and just cool accessory to my workspace 
neutral,i got this mouse and charged it like it said to but when went to use it it doesn even work would not recomend anyone to get this mouse 
neutral,incredible sound long battery life 
positive,very comfortable sounds is good mic works well 
positive,worked great at first with both my pc and xbox sound was way better than my old headset after one day it started having problems it either would not work at all or the mic would not work cheap chinese junk but did not want to spend ton on headset so rolled the dice edit bengoo customer support reached out to me multiple times and offered refund continued to troubleshoot the headset and got it to work with my xbox by buying new xbox controller the microphone still does not work with discord on my pc however changed rating to stars 
neutral,they are uncomfortable after about minutes if you have glasses
neutral,jbl has always been go to for me can go wrong with this one love the color ocean blue the bass hits we all dig it at work buy this speaker 
positive,bought for my garage used less than times and won play turns on and immediately powers off even plugged in big waste of money 
positive,great product and packaging overall durable materialssmooth point and silent click featureeasy to follow instructionsbright led lights make this mouse fun for any age bonus you can opt to turn the led function off if when needed tired of all that clicking this mouse is for you with the silent clickdefinitely product worth owning 
positive,the item shipped quickly and arrived as described sound quality is great and sound can fill up room not very bass heavy but good balance also like the ability to charge other devices 
positive,yeah this thing is pretty great honestly it works really well and is completely silent which really like at work don like to be constantly clicking all the time the rubberized feel is also very satisfying and mean very satisfying overall you really can go wrong here for the price 
positive,it wasn until my husband gave me his mouse to play my sims with that realized how much loved using one even on laptop he said could have his red and black one but lo and behold when opened up amazon and put in wireless mouse found my own type of dream mouse got the mint green colored one and honestly obsessed with the glowing of the different colors great mouse great price wish needed more than one to be honest 
positive,love them recommend
neutral,the mouse itself was wonderful it installed within seconds and was very smooth operating it fit well in my small hand and there was no clicking noise wish it worked out as liked the mouse itself the only issue is not the mouse itself but my sensitivity to the led optical lights got migraine from it the led light can be turned off so that in itself could be remedied but the optical light which is bright red showed through the side lights the gap between the switches and the dpi option switch there was no way of blocking the light was really sad had to return it 
neutral,very silent
neutral,these things stop working after few weeks got two and one it just refuses to charge or stay on the other the scroller fell very poorly made do not purchase 
positive,sound is great mic is great everything about these headphones are top notch they even light up and didn know that was so excited when got them in the mail so cute and so high quality 
neutral,excelente
positive,maybe had crazy expectation for this but just feel like it not loud there no bass at all probably going to return it find something little bit better 
positive,the box was torn and there is scratch smudge on it hope it works well the colors are beautiful though love how the white mouse looks it very clean stars because of the smudge can get off and packaging it obvious not the first one to own it 
neutral,usb plug is short and doesn reach most ports if you have the audio jack plugged as well 
neutral,i have tried everything to get the mic to work on this headset to no avail 
positive,i like the mouse originally thought it wast great for the price and glad to be wrong the mouse is little sensitive because dropped it once causing it to freeze somewhat however after re installing it it seemed to fix the issue also am enjoying the colour changing which helps me relax almost overall highly recommend as it is compatible with pc and mac just plug and play 
positive,easy installation lights don say on the entire time only when keyboard is in use only down side is that it doesn come with an extended warranty so that is something they should work on only purchased this because my spacebar went out on my laptop yes could have brought it some where to have the whole keyboard replaced but why have those noisy techs all in the business and have to order it so all tge wait nope pass now have this dope keyboard that lights up and works great 
negative,horrible garbage don wast your money
positive,i ve had these for about years now and they still feel and sound great good choice for standard cheap headset or general pc usepros plastic is light and flexible good for long play sessions cord is strong even after few mishaps with my chair wheel good sound quality not an expert in sound mixing but know what bad headphones sound like rarely use the mic but it functional and the mute switch still holds solidcons cord may be strong but it prone to bending in weird ways it may just be how rapped my cord around the back of my neck but it caused part of it to form rigid curve the volume control is little loose and will sometimes rise or lower if brushed against noise cancelling is effective but not perfect about what you expect though depending on what you want this could be positive led is barely feature it either takes up usb port or the plug dangles from the back of your pc or the bottom of your controller
neutral,phenomenal
positive,it came in great condition the only issue have is that the mic is apparently muffled this might be an issue with the audio splitter it comes with though 
neutral,great product no issues
neutral,great overall broke too quickly but that just might be cause the kids use the heck out of it 
positive,great bass and rich and amazing sound
neutral, this product is not worth the headache the first mouse stopped scrolling after weeks of use returned it and days after using the new mouse am returning it and requesting refund the mouse doesn hold charge because there is red light around the whole mouse that is always on even when switched off the previous mouse wasn like this and worked well until it stopped scrolling now have to go to second location to return the mouse again they should reimburse the gas ve used returning this mouse probably spent more in gas than what paid for the mouse as you can see in the video it is off but the light is on turn it off and the light on then turn it off again and the light doesn turn off 
neutral,the scroll wheel broke in the exact same way twice in the last months we opened the mouse up and it not simple fix so the first time we replaced it but this time we re just going with different brand
positive,i love this mouse actually purchased two because of the look but they are great use one at my home office and one at my office 
neutral,mouse comes with converted bracket to convert your usb slot to regular usb slot so you can use it but the parts stick way out and are ungainly 
neutral,dont buy stopped working after weeks
positive,love this mouse it small and slim works great and you can turn the lights on or off to meet your preference 
neutral,cable quit charging mouse after one charge 
positive,i recommend these because they are great for sound and gaming they are comfortable but they aren the best have ever had as far as comfort goes overall they are great quality 
positive,love this speaker
positive,soo cute very sleek design love that it came with the type attachment have new laptop that doesn have usb ports oh yea the rose gold color matches my laptop perfectly the color changing lights around thw mouse are to die for very cool feature
positive,we love the ease of use and sound quality of this speaker 
positive,grandson loved it
negative,do not buy this mouse stopped working august st yesterday thought it was just dead so made sure to charge it this morning go to use the mouse and it still is not working despite it being fully charged it just doesn turn on anymore am extremely disappointed because just bought this mouse on june th meaning that the return window closed on july th this mouse stopped working entirely doesn even turn on anymore two days after the return window closed do not buy this product if could give it less stars would 
positive,i brought these headphones because my turtle beaches randomly just broke and when say these are just amazing you can hear everything it shuts out everything and looks pretty good if you ask me
positive,i have small hands and this fits perfectly very cute and lightweight
positive,cute mouse love the blue on it and the lights are cute touch its very lightweight very quiet no clicking sounds from the mouse which is great 
positive,ordered this for my new laptop works like charm includes charging cable adapter and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely contacted them about activating warranty my only issue with this mouse is the shape which was more flat than the mice used to using but that is just personal preference and got used to it very quickly overall great product 
positive,sounds great for out doors sitting area highly recommend 
positive,sounds great 
positive,i loved this product for couple of weeks but after is ran out of juice the first time and charged it overnight it hasn worked again cannot recommend this product and love to give rating wanted to just exchange it but no option for that guess had it too long but it is fun and beautiful 
positive,honestly feels bit on the cheap side and compared to other similar makes the main difference being led lighting so it adds wow factor to it clicking is also smooth and feels nice and the top down view is pleasing the lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than seamless transition performance wise it does the job but ergonomically doesn feel as form fitting as gaming mouse really use this as backup work mouse or home mouse where its just to surf the web also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps first time this has happened on mouse so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price if were to guess the price if seen the product without price tag probably say its about bucks 
positive,the clicks are nice and quiet the lights are pretty the battery lasts long time it very simple plug and play 
positive,great headphones for gaming highly recommend 
neutral,works very well
positive,i love this keyboard works great with my xbox one happy to see usb type charging port in it this is my first klim purchase but after seeing the quality of this keyboard and reading the note that came with it it definitely not going to be the last 
neutral,broke after days wheel broke and went down into the mouse and doesn work wouldn recommend it cheap for reason knew shouldn have bought anything other than logitech 
positive,bought this for an office laptop it works great 
positive,i really love this keyboard for the price could not have asked for better one 
neutral,i needed new mouse for work didn want to deal with batteries and this is exactly what was looking for it light and smooth 
positive,this mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews it is light good to hold and has good battery life it is also quiet with exceptions see below its main problem however is that the middle button the scrollwheel becomes unusable after only short amount of use after which the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register button press also compared to the lmb rmb buttons which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally the mmb is extremely rigid in comparison it is also very noisy which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent it is much more noisy than other mice have used which is about as someone who relies on this button during daily usage this is very frustrating and frankly serious design flaw like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well not rough also bought the non led version of this mouse and the exact same problem appeared after the same amount of time another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low leaving one to guess when to recharge it it often becomes erratic mouse pointer moves around and does not register movement well requiring power cycle this is occuring on more than one system all in all decent attempt but quite few issues need to be ironed out doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than couple of weeks usage as these issues are consistent and appeared after months frankly expect mouse to last significantly longer and also have useable middle mouse button hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer 
neutral,poorly built don order 
positive,i ordered one as gift and the first one received did not work however the second one ordered that was then gifted also worked perfect
positive,i thought this mouse was very cute love the led feature and used it to play games with friends val league genshin etc and it is passable for someone who plays casually like me but probably not for someone picky about equipment however today it spent some time in the side pocket of my backpack and no longer seems to work turn it on and the light flashes and goes off again and there is no way to take it apart or try to fix it if you transport your laptop pc lot would hesitate to get this mouse but otherwise was fan 
positive,great product
positive,awesome speaker loud as you want it to go we use it outside and it an amazing little guy get it wet keeps on going
positive,won buy againdoesn lite up as promised
negative,my fianc got me this as birthday gift and of course now just outside of the return window my mic doesn work so no one can hear me when we playing together and the headset doesn light up either very disappointed as now have headset that serves no purpose to me and can return 
neutral,junk bought it for my ps and apparently you have to have the usb and headset jack plugged in for everything to work 
positive,i ve had this for about year or two now and it works amazing have had it fully submerged underwater and just being splashed also take us in the shower or gets little steamy and it works perfectly and all those different conditions like to listen to podcasts or music when go to sleep so usually have this playing when go to bed and it lasts overnight and usually for like whole week but usually have my podcast or music on for only an hour or two but have the speaker on all night if that makes sense the speaker is also really loud and it connects to other jbl speakers really easily which like like to listen to music when ride my bike so bought this strap for the jbl speaker which connects it to my bike and the jbl speaker works really well on it really recommend this product 
positive,unit is ok but it is mono speaker the sound quality is just not there my charge sounds much better and trust me it has been used it does state that this unit only has one speaker but it is worded that if you take quick glance you would not catch it it should be stated very clearly that this is mono speaker unit not stereo like the rest of the charge models it is an alright unit but had known it was mono would have picked different model jbl it would be in your best interest to discontinue the charge then perhaps you would not get so many bad reviews 
neutral,you are not going to find better headset for the money can hear someone sneaking up on my on cod but can hear my wife talking to me from the kitchen 
neutral,the product is as shown in the picture
negative,mouse is tiny in my hand scroll wheel broke within the first week usb plug is terrible the worst ive ever had to deal with upon trying to remove the wireless usb plug from any any the top half come out but the metal part stays stuck in the plug this has happened repeatedlyi just bought different mouse
neutral,much better than previous mouse devices ve used 
positive,this is just what my son wanted the ears phones light up but can get over how much noise is canceled this is great value my son isn gamer but uses this for learning in school great find 
positive,this is waterproof but have not gotten it wet yet it is nice size and has really good sound the blue tooth connectivity is fast 
positive,it perfect for me thin need gps tracker though the kids want it 
positive,this mouse is amazing its super quiet when clicking and it runs smooth even on bed sheets it works on any surface 
positive,i bought this to use at work as they only provided wired mouse charged it before taking it in and it been weeks now and haven had to recharge it yet it fits comfortably into my hand and is lightweight 
positive,the have great sound and work what need them for also the shipping was quick
positive,it ergonomic and stylish very cute colors and cool lights comes with all the attachments like cords for charging and it has small indent under the mouse to keep the part that plugs into your laptop forever losing mine so that great feature very quiet as well recommend it for nice cheap little mouse 
neutral,this was waist of money it cuts out and can even use the usb 
neutral,a little disappointed with the brightness and the fact that it sleeps immediately after use
positive, so out of boredom ordered one of these gaming keyboards this one from klim and got into the head of the gamer must say there is tangible cool factor to battle ready keyboard everything is in the spirit of the gamer there is an air of science and fantasy as you email your coworkers something really mundane aside from that here what else the klim offers the keyboard is nice and quiet accuracy is the same as with my old keyboard turning off the lights in my home office and typing from colorful keyboard is cool 
negative,i bought this mouse twice because wasn able to return them in time due to mailing issues thought the first one must be an error since it broke after hours of use guess how long the second mouse lasted hours absolute crap product and wasted my money
positive,i needed wireless mouse and specifically wanted one that matched my new laptop this mouse exceeded my expectations love the that it lights up and comes in variety of colors it kinda hard to find silver mouse especially one that is compatible with type usb so am happy 
positive,would totally recommend can be used for personal listening or with bigger group for chill hangouts parties
negative,i am not impressed which is odd because ve owned few jbl products and they have been nothing shy of amazing have jbl rd generation now that have far better sounds quality than the th gen it won stay connected to blue tooth when the never have that problem there is feature with jbl that allows you to hook up to jbls together guess who won stay connected mine it so annoying and put in return for the item but got very sick and now can return it at all in my opinion it waste of money you are better off get something else 
positive,i bought this specifically for pool party it loud waterproof not obnoxiously big and can still fit in bag loving my aqua color wasn home so my husband did an unboxing idk about everyone else but regardless if this only has internal speaker it jbl go for quality over quantity the sound is impeccable 
neutral,i like the size and the fact don have to change betteries
negative,this speaker doesn have built in microphone so you cannot pair it with phone this is pants on head retarded 
positive,st off this product advertises as if there are lights on it there aren its just sticker that doesn have any led function very misleading nd the headset is very poorly made the earpieces barely fit my year old they are far too small to fit an adults ears rd the sound quality is subpar takes lot of adjustment and you get better quality from an xbox default headset do not buy this 
negative,it broke literally less than month and ive never even dropped it super disappointed and waste of money 
neutral,i was kinda disappointed with this keyboard on one hand it great and affordable wireless keypad it feels bit cheap but it serves its purpose thought it was backlit but it not really hence the star review not sure if it me or the description of the product but was really disappointed in this regard overall though it good little wireless keyboard not great if what you re looking for is keyboard to use in dim lighting though even on the best setting it seems to go dim over very short period of time 
neutral,the clearness sharpness of sound also that it came in camouflage vet 
positive,it great ergonomic mouse for gaming 
positive,it great keyboard keys are little difficult to press sometimes more like typewriter overall do like the keyboard
positive,i play games like world of tank blitz and fs that uses wasd to control lot the keyboard really helps me to reduce the load of the original laptop keyboard however this keyboard battery life is not so long that you need to charge probably every days if you play about hours averagely plus it is not so friendly in helping you talking through typing since the arrangement always makes me type out lots of typos 
positive,is very good quality product my son love it because he play play station also he love the color and sounds great when he is talking
neutral,i tried charging the mouse but it didn want to charge tried multiple cables and nothing light kept switching and when plugged the adapter in it didn pop up or recognized it 
neutral,stay away
neutral,it was quiet slim and responsive for month then the casing began pulling apart and the rolling cursor stopped responding too bad it was such short lived product 
positive,my wife and spend lot of time in the outdoors and were looking to upgrade out speaker the most important things that we were looking for were sound quality needed to be waterproof and something that would be durable and last long time this speaker has certainly delivered on all of these things one of the biggest complaints that saw while during research was the mono speaker there are some users out there that severely dislike this design and honestly it almost swayed me away from buying it that said could not be happier with this speaker mono speaker works great produces amazing sound really loud and it truly is water proof trust me we ve tested would definitely buy this speaker again 
negative,not as loud as was expecting for the price that paid idk if there was something wrong with mine but it seems to loose connection to my iphone pro max after few minutes
positive, after reading few reviews decided to give this headset try when put it on immediately felt the comfort the were talking about the quality that you get for the price makes it very much worthy it isn name brand headset you find at game stop but it is comparable maybe better stars hands down 
neutral,after while month or two of using the mic no problems ve noticed when outside of discord call on my pc it would turn up the game playing like roblox and spotify to extreme extents and the sound quality would dip kinda just making me not wanna use them outside of call so now just close my laptop but always stay in call idk why this is problem for me maybe because it changes to mode when you are in social media call but otherwise the headset is greta for it price mic is bit loud tho 
positive,bought for my great grandson he loves them
neutral,this speaker works great clear sound and the battery last long time only bad thing is if it gets hot it will shut off so keep in shady spot outside 
positive,very nice sleek little mouse its not the color ordered really don like rose gold but the price is great its otherwise everything wanted and is good product does what its supposed to do just wish it was black lol btw checked did order black 
neutral,i loved this mouse so much that bought one for my daughter and my mom ve only had this for less than months and it just stopped working tried charging it in multiple outlets switched the usb around and nothing it just flashes red when plug the charger in and goes off so very disappointed because ll now have to buy another and can return this one 
neutral,i chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories however the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable it extremely light weight however feel it is going to break easily since the plastic is so thin so far for gaming ve had no issues with performance of the mouse itself 
positive,great
neutral,not functional for gaming if the charge doesn last 
positive,so far great sounding speaker very well balanced sound most of the middle that comes out of it is crisp and clear good punchy bass clear treble well defined mix for most music styles 
neutral,doesn have as long of battery life as stated in the details of the product other than that satisfied with my purchase and the quality of the product 
neutral,i plugged it in and let it charge over night was so excited to use it becuae though it was so cute did not work from day when turned the power on it would flash red then would try to use it and nothing zero zip nothing would work waste of time buying it waste of time trying to get it to work and now waste of time having to return it so very disappointed
positive,my brother gave to his wife loves the sound and size
neutral,i have two problems no matter how long you charge it for it dead in an hour that if it been works the usb plug in takes two people to get out and afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer the appearance is great but it doesn work and could break the usb port because of this do not recommend since this posted the company offered to change review instead of just sending another mouse clearly they know there product does not work 
positive,awesome product
positive,i love it 
positive,this is perfect for gaming
neutral,where is charging cable the one bought years ago had one wtf and the rechargeable battery only lasted years and didn use it that much but they do have good sound quality
positive,both worked for month both are having issues now one won charge the other is having connection issues
positive,im in love with this speakers have purchased three already and love them 
neutral,worked great for less than month received in april and broke today may no clue what happened went to use it after taking break for few hours and it just fell apart and not able to put it back together 
positive,she on her second pair yr old but the first set lasted over year great for how she treats them and the price 
positive,i got this mouse to use with my laptop and it great glides easily holds charge for quite while and enters sleep mode when not in use to wake the mouse up you just right or left click the changing lights are great and fun touch
negative,product just died after few months will no longer take charge it just dead 
positive,i got this for my office because like pretty things which it is as far as gaming can say
positive,this headset is purely amazing there is really no more to it it has noise cancellation and overall amazing quality
positive,slim in the hand and works great 
negative,scroll wheel broke weeks into having it and stopped working not even months later 
neutral,boating 
positive,liked the light up the noise cancelling could ve been better 
positive,feels great and looks great sounds of the game come through clear and room noises are almost nothing 
positive,i love the colors of the led lights and the sleek size of the mouse itself but you can use the feature of wireless because it won hold single charge ve had it charged for days now and it won work unplugged 
neutral,this headset is connected to my controller and use it to play games there is mic on off switch on the headset which use to mute and unmute myself when necessary now that switch does nothing no matter what position the switch is in the mic doesn work also randomly and often there will be bunch of crackling and humming sounds that is heard by all players online at the moment coming from me this happens even with the microphone not working headphones sound quality is nice but mic needs some work 
positive,used it twice was so happy with it worked great tried to use it the last days and it doesn work at all turn it on light comes on then turns off and won turn back on not pleased 
neutral,work well 
neutral,came missing usb receiver 
neutral,very nice product 
negative,i got this multiple times it is terrible headset and hate it
neutral,excelente product
positive,this was great find for me have an ergonomic computer desk that raises to standing as needed the keyboard drawer is not wide and other keyboards hung out the back and front this one fits fine and still feels like as it is regular keyboard like the indicator lights caps numlock etc are well lit when on and the technicolor backlighting is nice to see and let me know everything is working 
positive,works great
positive,very good mouse recommend 
neutral,either sound mile away or blow out my friends ears with static there is no inbetween no matter what settings fiddle with rate it if could
neutral,on day the mouse doesn seem to be tracking well it behaves like it on an uneven surface mouse gets stuck for half second as your moving it then jumps despite being on completely smooth surface the build quality seems very poor 
positive,awesome sound great for use in our rv or around the lake battery has some kick which accounts for the weight but that works for me 
neutral,stopped working after week 
positive,this mouse is very quiet just as advertised was shocked at the lack of clicking when you push the right or left side that was my main push to purchase besides the cool colors and led lights must say those are just an aestetic bonus but it kind of makes working fun this mouse is plastic so the gold tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic it charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse overall this mouse is really great am glad bought it and if you are sitting on the fence just go ahead and get it 
positive,happy purchased this product the sound quality is good and it perfect for just daily listening in your office or living room sometimes connect it to my laptop when stream shows has the power to fill up large living room with good quality sound haven used it outdoors but am confident that it can provide all the power you need for backyard bbq battery life is also very good this device is pretty easy to connect to and use would recommend this for someone who is looking for an easy to use sound system who wants to casually listen to music while doing other things 
positive,works great lights are not too bright goes great with the gaming pad 
neutral,last about weeks then started loosing mic uninstalled audio reinstalled and worked for week now its hit or miss screw chinese knck offs spend another for american made 
positive,they are great
neutral,it extremely uncomfortable to use maybe if you re on trip and need something to do the job this will work definitely not for daily use gaming or work 
positive,the mouse works better then expected the battery life has exceeded week so far if you have surface go this mouse will not disappoint very happy with this item would recommend 
positive,excellent 
positive,inexpensive but the quality matches those of way more expensive mouses also this mouse has led lights which is very nice will definitely be recommending this to my friends 
positive,i wasn expecting much from the gaming headset got from bengoo but they far exceeded my expectations like them better than previous gaming headphones purchased off amazon sound great and look great as well 
positive,great keyboard connects quickly to pc and the battery last decent amount of time the only thing wish it had that it doesn would be that the light constantly stays on but unfortunately it does not not big deal though the first keyboard they sent to me was not registering every key pressed but it was never specific to any specific keys contacted customer support regarding the issue and after having me run few tests they determined the keyboard was defective and sent me new one within two days great company
neutral, loved this mouse but after couple of months it started making weird noise while scrolling points for that
positive,awesome sound quality loved that the wire connectors are very heavy duty sound cancelation is amazing best gaming headset yet 
negative,arrived in broken package that was ripped wet etc the amount of money spent on it should warrant decent product not thrilled that waited week to receive garbage product very irritating and very disappointed overall 
negative,it is quite nice it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it special touch unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy the sleep mode seems to fail constantly sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for while being fully charged so it must be damaged internally very disappointed with this product no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function 
positive,awesome sound and bass
negative,i purchased the speaker couple months ago and it already stopped working this is my nd one to stop working out of nowhere sad because love the sound quality
positive,the sleep mode keeps you from having to charge very often feels good in my palm quiet click is nice works well 
positive,i love this speaker soo much use it everywhere and everyday the sound is super loud even used it to play music for kickback and it held its ground and pulled through for me you won regret getting this speaker trust me 
negative,i purchased this mouse on march all of sudden the mouse just don want to move in the directions need it to each time move the mouse to different templates or screens it move then pause then move little and pause again would not recommend the mouse to anyone worst mouse ve ever purchased 
neutral,mic quit working after month
positive, update have finally tried with my pc and tried on both mine and my husbands and the sound works fine it not very noise canceling but it is nice to hear the base and actually pick up on detail otherwise wouldn have heard without it the downfall is that the mic won work at all of course played with the toggle and made sure it wasn my computer settings and it still isn working put in for return so hopefully this one is defective and the new headset will be better super bummed because really wanted to like this headset bought this gaming headset specifically for my ps and as advertised it states that it is compatible and it is not have the original sony ps controllers so it not even like using off brand ve tried with both of my controllers and nothing have not tried with my pc yet will update my review once try it with the pc
positive,pretty solid headphones especially for the price ve paid double for other headphones didn like as much 
positive,it good quality overall im just little mad about it not lighting up but it still good gift for gamer 
positive,just received replacement mouse as the first one stopped working after few months really like this mouse it glides smoothly and without time delay used this strictly for basic internet and office work not gaming it also visually attractive with changing color lights this has great year warranty which covers defects problems very pleased so far 
negative,i got of these and so far have been returned they work until they need charged and then they stop working don waste your money 
positive,the colors are fun and different the thing did not like was that the default color is red if it is not in rainbow mode the material is okay it works at it should it is great that its rechargeable it holds charge for long time and if you forget to turn it off the sleep mode works well 
positive,so this lil guy is the best super loud super clean tone the battery life is great and the fact you can use it to charge device while using it is also super rad ridiculous product for the cost 
neutral,the head phones are good but they stopped working after months
negative,i have never had headset with worse mic audio quality is complete guarbage headset sound is bad too
neutral,very good
positive,it works great is fast 
neutral,bought this when it on sale totally worth the money 
positive,great speaker sound quality is clear and loud
negative,why does this always happen with bluetooth speakers ve tried multiple power sources computer computer charger wall and several usb cables no charge can even factory reset bought paper weight furious 
positive,bought for family member and she loves it thanks jbl 
positive,battery life is long black lighting is really nice and key typing noise is nice not too loud also good price would recommend 
positive,i got these headphones to upgrade my cheap starter pair and have been using them to teach english online since january they have performed wonderfully can hear my students pronunciation very clearly my students have no trouble hearing or understanding me and am not dealing with headache after wearing them for five hours straight plus my chinese students think they look cool they ve been great investment and highly recommend them for other online esl teachers 
positive,stopped working two days after we received them but the customer service is amazing 
positive,i bought this for my son and so far he really likes it overall design looks nice however he said he can still hear the background noises 
neutral,great little mouse it does not tell you that it is about to die though and you have to plug it in to charge it no batteries which will slow you down if working or gaming with it 
neutral,gaming
neutral,not sure why but it kept dying real quick 
positive,i use these when playing xbox online very good sound quality 
neutral,they have good sound quality and experience but the volume is little light hopefully that just my bad ears
positive,very good product for gaming the quality is really good 
negative, month update this thing squeals now it took me week to figure out why kept hearing high pitched whine every time moved my cursor and eventually realized that something inside the mouse is creating very high pitched squeal every time move it that on top of the mouse dying in about day of use now means that this thing is no go definitely buy something else this thing has been total headache since got it the battery on this mouse doesn seem to last very long time after about two days of usage it ll die find myself plugging it in every night to make sure don have to deal with that additionally the thing goes to sleep after about minute or two without movement super annoying you have to click the mouse to wake it up again and doing so registers click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep can recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading you ll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about million times 
neutral,i bought this last year not wanting to pay for premium mouse and after seeing so many comments turns out it mistake the mouse stops working after few months when work from home the pointer just doesn react at all only the scroll works if it functional mouse it actually quite well made and like the design overall my kid loves the color sadly have to put on this review

positive,bought this for my work computer and it is great love that it lights up when in use makes it easier for me to read the keyboard 
negative,it was fine to use at first but it stopped working after about month of using it consistently not impressed with longevity 
positive,i got it for my wife and she loved it
neutral,it charges very fast battery lasts long time they still haven designed better charging port the flap pushes on the cable causing weakness in the charge replaced my for the after the sound started getting strange the has the same issue 
neutral,i did not like that it made very faint squealing noise the colors are pretty and the clicks are quiet but everytime the mouse moves you can hair high pitch noise the instructions were all in foreign language as well
positive,the good easy plug and play connection keys are lit up real good and easy to see in the dark keys have nice feel to them and are relatively quiet so far battery charge lasts the whole day of pretty solid gaming the bad user manual is kinda so so backlighting turns off kinda quickly and sure that can be adjusted but again the user manual is kinda so so 
neutral,excelente
neutral,gift my son is gamer
positive,i use this mouse for work it didn require any weird setup like downloading software it super comfy and has sleep mode that activates after about minutes click of the button wakes it up and it ready to go don regularly use the light up mode but it is cool feature that is fun to show off have carpal tunnel and it so much better on my wrist than standard wired computer mouse most definitely worth the purchase 
positive,love this keyboard so far hope not disappointed
positive,i like that it easily paired up with my phone liked the bass it had and loud it could go
positive,it strange to hold but it works for it intended purpose it not completely silent but it quiet and that good enough for me 
positive,battery life is incredible hours for sure speak has nice sound quality and can get very loud plus it waterproof which comes in handy just in case or when out on the boat
positive,i bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break to be honest loved this mouse at first the lights the feel everything however was not fan of the extra added adapter to make it usb compatible here am months after bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well for some reason the companies that make these portable mouse mice cannot make one that has sturdy mouse wheel oddly enough the one thing didn like about the mouse originally became my favorite thing now that it is broken the adapter to allow me to run regular usb on usb port 
positive,easy to see in the dark great feel to keys good battery life would buy again
positive,the mouse is aesthetically very cute and does feel nice on the hand main issue is for both gaming and other computer activities the mouse will randomly jump across the screen which has never happened with any other mouse it led to misclicks ve deleted emails didn mean to because of it essentially just unreliable 
neutral,the mouse does not work very disappointed it freezes on the screen 
positive,i love that do not need batteries it recharges fairly quick slim design fits my had perfectly also love can turn it off 
neutral,this mouse is ok except for the battery life it didn make it through full hr day of work before shutting off and needing to be charged again 
negative,i purchased this little over months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than than weekend days so started turning it off about months later noticed lagging in click response soon after clicks were not engaging replaced it with brand name you get what you pay for but thought should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement it been over weeks now and no response do not recommend this product or its manufacturer beware 
positive,sound quality is great 
neutral,i bought this as just quick way to navigate my tablet in hurry the sleep mode is perfect since don use it but now and then when hear an alert just tap to wake up and click no need to keep re syncing and the charge has lasted long time tiny but not too tiny 
positive,i really like that it comes with usb adapter saved my life because the new macbooks aren compatible with usb over all really nice mouse fits in my hand perfectly and love the lights on it 
neutral,this is really nice mouse like it and it works well the only thing is you charge it with mini usb charger and it takes long time not sure if not charging it all the way but it has short battery life 
neutral,i do you like it so far but it started to come apart at the seam put it together bit concerned if it going to just do this again must be due to quality have been very careful with it
positive,it was awesome definitely buying in the future again loved the noise cancellation 
neutral,i not pc gamer but spend lot of time on my personal pc during the day wanted something inexpensive with backlit keyboard and number pad and this fits the bill the keys do make an audible click so it not silent really like the value of this keyboard and the design 
neutral,mouse is supposed to have setting which allows it to change colors the lights stay red on both settings no color changing 
neutral,it got wet and had no issues battery life is great lasted all day 
positive,nice speaker big sound and good battery life 
positive,i ordered the charge as wanted speaker with little more volume and punch and compared to my jbl flip the flip beats this larger speaker hands down the sound quality is good on this charge battery life is very good and it does have fair volume just not what expected took the charge camping and set it up on table at our camp trailer went out to the camp fire people asked me to turn it up some when explained it was at max volume they were surprised luckily brought my jbl flip and it performed much better even though it lot smaller 
neutral,it decent mouse lower middle in quality but reasonable price at fifteen feels kinda cheap wheel is noisy 
positive,i bought this for my brother and tried it out before gave it to him it has amazing sound quality almost kept it for myself 
positive, and differently from the alienware saved about dollars love the fact you can switch the leds off to save battery also good battery is rechargeable although in about weeks never had to charge it yet good quality and fun to use also awfully cheap which is always plus not sure if is good match for gaming ve used it in the new ms flight simulator and must say the response was fine not sure though if it would be fast enough for the kill em all gamestotally recommended 
positive,for gaming like the noise cancellation like the surround sound especially for gaming
negative,i just received my charge but no usb charger came with it do this supposed to come with charger or just the speaker itself it ridiculous if it just sold for the speaker only and you have to to buy charger separately 
neutral,didn work no way to charge it
positive,works very well but wish it had option for regular battery 
positive,good fit good sound plug and play 
positive,mouse works fine and the grandkids love them they mainly use them for school work and for gaming 
positive,comfortable headset 
neutral,item came broken definitely looks used tried to charge and use still but scroll doesn work 
neutral,works great no issues
neutral,when seller states in the first bullet that the headset is compatible with laptops and it is not that really bothers me my son is happy because he has new headset to use with his gaming console however am out of pocket and have to spend more money to look for something that is compatible with laptop it is disappointing do not buy for use with laptop because it does not work like they claim even with the adapter that is included in the packaging 
neutral,it had connectivity issues right out of the box contacted the seller and he she did not respond it never worked even if it had it is so misshapen it isn comfortable to use cannot recommend seller or product 
neutral,really like these
neutral,this mouse worked for day and then stopped it was very comfortable to use and silent click which was nice but it stopped working so it pointless 
positive,fast shipping great sound quality good battery life 
positive,this mouse is so silent really like thatand it super light glad made this purchase the lights are supe cool easy to install and use worth the money 
negative,i bought this mouse just over month ago and it has already stopped working awful product and waste of money 
negative,i didnt like the headset plug in cause deteriated quickly and quit working on speker and headset complete bad plug ins
positive,excellent keyboard
positive,works great and the dpi does all need it too
positive,very nice comfortable and work as expected 
neutral,i use it for gaming have no problem with it 
positive,this is an awesome speaker great sound
positive,this is hands down the best bluetooth speaker ve ever owned do not even hesitate buy it it awesome just be sure to check where it coming from because there are lot of fraudulent knock offs out there amazing speaker buy it again in heartbeat 
positive,the mouse is ergonomic very easy to use the price is not bad either all in all good purchase 
neutral,headset randomly stopped working one day was in the middle of game and all of my audio got cut nothing could do to fix it cheap quality headset do not buy 
positive,great keyboard nice slim colorful works well customer service is outstanding company really wants to ensure satisfaction 
negative,someone has missed the point there doesn seem to be way to keep the lights on either wirelessly which is the point of purchasing wireless keyboard or wired not power saving move as the shut off timing is the same with the keyboard plugged in the backlighting when it is on is not helpful as it barely shows through the key to highlight the number or letter but shows off the space around the keys so when looking down on the keyboard the eye is drawn to the space around the keys instead of the key itself completely uselessa strange design choice also interferes with the use of the keyboard there is an extra key next to the enter return which is really annoying instead of hitting enter you are more likely to hit backslash which really makes entering passwords joy this key is above the enter key on every other keyboarda very bad choice on my part from all the wireless backlit keyboards available
neutral,for the price of this headset you can go wrong very comfortable and sound quality is good but doesn turn up too loud can still hear someone if they talk loud enough 
positive,overall love the build and the color and feel of the keyboard but do not like the style of the enter key instead of tall enter key it would be better and more comfortable to have the long enter key like most standard keys 
neutral,i bought this mouse so could have something rather than trackpad for college read the manual and did everything to get this mouse to work the softwares that are compatible with this mouse are older have the macos this mouse is only compatible with the macos if you re looking for mouse and you re in the same situation as me this one isn it 
positive,i was looking forward to not having to use batteries and not have to worry about wires it was great at first and really liked it then after about week the charge did not even last day and then it quit even charging don waste your money the only silver lining is that had used my reward points so there was no out of pocket 
positive,great product with reasonable price bought second one 
positive,obsessed with this speaker great sound quality volume level charges my iphone fast and still maintains plenty of battery life ve taken this speaker on kayak and still works perfectly after getting wet and bumped around 
positive,well had to prep them to handle floating ground output amplifier these headfones are almost knocking my eardrums out of my nose with precise and powerful sound delivery 
positive,super sad because was obsessed with this mouse but it has already stopped working after one month super frustrating should had just gone to best buy originally 
negative,i ve only had this for few months now and it is completely broken the scroll feature lost its traction and no longer works the battery life wasn great and it never worked flawlessly need new mouse now 
neutral,this product doesn charge at all
neutral,price is bit higher
negative,i especially dislike the fact that the rgb turns itself off after minute or so of no use purchased this keyboard because the one had did that if your playing game and using mouse or game controller then you don need the key oard much but when you do you can see which button is which until you strike key and activate the lighting what the point in rgb lights if they don just stay on guess ll be buying third keyboard but this time ll make sure it isn practically useless to me probably go newegg 
positive,love this little bullet for the money it the best thing out there 
neutral,i really liked these headphones but after only having them for couple months the mic stopped working they can hear me at all but can hear other players it glitches in and out often they were great until they completely stopped working update tried to give me half bribe to take down my review so all can buy more of these cheap headphones paid more than for them 
neutral,this is very good product
neutral,this mouse is seriously cool it comfy quiet click and has light show 
positive,i love the color as it my favorite color and love how pure my voice sounds and that have no background feedback
positive,this speaker rocks you will not be disappointed perfect size charge last all day even at max volume jbl procts are the best 
positive,i got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the pc so far her experience with it has been great the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she lefty the main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten plus for me 
positive,love the size feel and color of this speaker it was very easy to connect to my phone and ve been quite impressed with the sound quality even more impressive is the battery life of this speaker can go days to weeks without charging depending on how much play music like that you can charge your phone off of it too 
negative,when first got this keyboard noticed that my passwords were often wrong though knew had typed them correctly missing keys started showing in browsers and and applications alike there was no rhyme or reason to it about of key strokes just didn appear sometimes angrily pressing the same key or times in row produced no result thought that it might be low battery without the warning light even when left the usb cable plugged in all the time performance did not improve if you use this keyboard for gaming you will suffer lots of premature death if you use it for work you will suffer crippling frustration am using mine as paper weight having switched back to an old dell keyboard that came with my tower pc years ago the battery life did not impress even with the brightness somewhat muted the tactile feedback is poor too it just always had an un satisfying feel 
positive,this is the best headset ve ever used and for affordable price it not bad at all 
positive,klim went above and beyond sending us new keyboard since we couldn purchase new bluetooth dongle that we lost their communication back and forth was excellent as well will absolutely buy more products from them 
negative,i took chance and bought this headset cause of the many good reviews but it by far the worst headset ever gamed with walmart headset was better then this crap it hurts my ears there only sound from the left side the right doesn have any sound at all and it extremely loud and staticky and if lower volume to try to hear people better in the game it just goes mute 
neutral,took days to ship so much for prime next day shipping and won light up without being plugged into usb waste of time and money 
negative,the cord tangles around itself in several locations the internal wiring is damaged and the product has failed in two months 
neutral,it works okay but is hard to charge 
positive,it is amazing sounds great
neutral,useless didn work 
positive,product worked great for st months now the usb charging port is bad and since it rechargable mouse it useless now led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks being optical vs laser it isn for gaming and battery wouldn last all day clicking it also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into hassle 
positive,excellent blue tooth speaker
negative,not attractive when lit up because the light leaks through the white shell just not attractive
positive,i made sure that this product was gonna be good one and was not disapointed it silent click which is nice the lights look awesome on it it was just worth it 
positive,bought this for my girlfriend for christmas did lot of research and decided on this bluetooth speaker the sound is fantastic which figured it would be coming from jbl she uses it with no issues connects right away and sounds fantastic 
positive,works great 
positive,arrived the next day and the sound is great 
positive,great mouse because you don have to keep batteries on hand it is rechargeable
neutral,i bought these headphones for my nephew he says that he likes the sound the material seems sturdy enough they are confortable and can be use with any device 
positive,i only got around hours on full charge but this was using the bluetooth and at max volume for such small device the sound is better than expected 
positive,really enjoyed wearing them they re extremely comfortable the mic is clear and they had no problem hearing me 
positive,speaker has clean sound just not loud enough to justify the increase in price the sound was huge disappointment if you like anything loud don buy the speaker stay with the charge 
positive,i have always loved jbl products and this speaker doesn disappoint whatsoever for portable bluetooth speaker this thing bumps like can hear it all over bed bath house for an apartment your neighbors might get mad if it too high the battery life is really good with many hours of use even at higher volume levels which drains the battery much faster the sound quality is awesome with great bass and clarity bluetooth connection is quick and easy and you can go pretty far away with your phone in your pocket and it won skip beat and of course it called the charge cuz you can charge other electronic devices with the usb charging plus that dope addition to an already great speaker finally the value for the money spent to purchase this and it definitely worth it price and then some the charge is and got this charge open box brand new for that an insane deal thanks to amazon haha my favorite bluetooth speaker of all time 
positive,great for it fits my head really well and doesn pinch at all sounds decent great find for so cheap 
neutral,good as expected
positive,a bunch of the lights are out so that kinda annoying could tell the box had been opened and it was probably return it not super ergonomic at least for people who would wear med large size medical gloves it does what it supposed to do but gonna get different one for my work computer and use this one for my personal computer that use maybe once month it doesn feel very good in my hand to use all day at my desk 
negative, tried everything contacted the support through the website and no response since feb th after the day got the item its the th rn of feb and so waited little longer for response but nothing and so tried to connect the cord to the item again nothing and the usb as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again so am disappointed in the product
positive,this is great speaker with great battery life and great bluetooth connectivity to our samsung and chromebook and the jbl app does firmware updates over bluetooth love it the reason for losing one star is its charging behavior bought this to have it in one location constantly connected to charger and to only carry it around from time to time running on battery for some reason the speaker charges fully the leds indicating the battery level go out to indicate that it fully charged but then after some time the leds turn on again and the th led starts blinking to indicate that it charging and stays that way all this while the speaker sits there connected to the charger without being turned on the leds are very bright which makes it more annoying 
positive,pretty good
neutral,while working on my desk close by book fell on top of the mouse and now it doesn take charge by the way it was the first day zi was using it 
neutral, 
positive,sound quality is pretty good and the mic feels sturdy we ve used them for about months now and still going strong 
neutral,not even month and it broken
neutral, light pink quiet when click smooth across my mouse pad and does not get stuck led lights change often all as advertised from my concern 
neutral,it barely lasts few hours before having to recharge it which is annoying think it is because of the led lights which drain the power 
positive,i like this gaming headset for my years old boy he like this headset because he didn heard another aound the headset have light easy to use he likes the volume botton he heard the clear voice over all he like it
positive,i use this mouse for my laptop love that it super smooth and very quick 
positive,this thing worked great the first time used it then wouldn work at all won charge won move the cursor total crap 
neutral,i ordered one back in october ish and it just gave out on me sound wise was using it in discord call and it randomly stopped transporting the sound so ordered new one it is good headset just upset it gave out so quickly 
positive,great sound loud and it floats definitely worth it compared to the competitors 
neutral,i like the sound 
positive,the keyboard feels steady the wireless connection is excellent just wish that the hand rest was at least inches long since use it on my lap 
negative,from what read this would plug into an android tablet have so that could control without using the touch screen but the adaptor did not allow this my mistake probably 
positive,it didn work properly and didn fit well on my head too big and bulky 
neutral,it was going well for few weeks then my son dropped his macbook and the usb type connected broke its so easy to break and would not recommend
positive,quality is great 
positive,easy to use have mouse pad and moves pretty good over it and perfect fit in my hands the quality of the product is good the size is good fit to carry in hand or with laptop bag 
positive,junk charged it and used it several times it worked for about handful of times charged again the light on the switch flashes but turns off immediately so that it won go on even though it is charged save your money and by well known brand
positive,i read lot of reviews across many sites as was trying to select portable bluetooth speaker for pool days in our back yard and also for our river camping trips the charge is waterproof so even better for our two primary uses was originally going to go with ultimate ears megaboom speaker until read about the jbl charge products and so glad did pretty particular about getting quality sound our of my home speakers computer speakers and headphones and very happy with what hear from the jbl charge for it size the sounds is amazing and very full with good bass but not overpoweringly so if you have an amazon echo of google smart speaker the sound from the charge blows those away the bluetooth syncing is super easy too if you ve ever had bluetooth syncing issues with other devices you know the irritation talking about that comes from that the charge sync to of our phones with ease definitely worth your consideration if you re looking for portable bluetooth speaker 
positive,this mouse was for my son for his school laptop he loves having it at school with the cool lights and it makes working on homework much more fun works great 
positive,had no problem with hooking it up the colors are beautiful and vibrant very nice and convenient when traveling 
positive,bought this mouse in january and fully charged it the same day got it until this day as am writing this review haven recharge it not once must say use it fair amount of time not to full extent everday but do use it really like the sleep mode that preserve the battery whole lot because sometimes just get up leave it and go out on the road spend few hours and come back and it still here doing great feel pretty satisfied with what payed for this didn expect it to hold up like this but give thanks five stars for this 
positive,bought it for my husband it great sound is good 
neutral,good sound quality and battery life
positive,this mouse is so slick and smooth it is very quiet with the clicking love it 
positive,the attached picture is for review of the stickers the letter that had to buy for this keyboard if you look at the paint that outlines the key it wearing off other keys are wearing off too and once they wear off you can see the letters you just see globs of colored light what use is an illuminated keyboard if you can see the keys what more if you don touch the keyboard for seconds the illumination disappears and the keyboard is completely dark even when it plugged in the only way to wake it is to touch the keyboard again so now you have keystrokes on your screen in your document on your game etc that you didn want know keyboards wear out but ve only had this one for few months very shortly after submitted this review and after took the time to add all of the stickers to the keyboard it began to malfunction and add characters that wasn even typing gave up and retired it after about months update never contacted the seller about the keyboard when they saw the feedback they reached out to me and replaced the keyboard for free without having to return the defective product four stars because will have to see how the keyboard works out for me this time but must give klim technologies usa six stars for outstanding customer service 
positive,i really like this keyboard it great because it pretty and lightweight don like that the charger is so weird though it has tendency to get loose that the only thing found wrong though don leave the power on don think this has sleep mode you ll come back and this thing will be stone dead lol always shut this off when done with it 
neutral,like that when not in use
positive,this product is actually really nice for the price nice sound quality and the noise cancellation is great also mine arrived with headphone jack splitter for pc which claims isnt included maybe that was typo who knows 
neutral,he stated it was sooooooooooooo gooooooooooood
neutral,the quality of these headphones are top notch
positive,there really no downside to this headset it comfortable fits snug around my ears instead of squishing them the sound is amazing the microphone moves smoothly and sends clear audio it also just looks nice 
positive,only thing don like is how short the usb cord is to make the headset light up everything else is good 
neutral,this product simply doesn work the charger connection port is mishapen 
neutral,it double types and disconnects all the time 
positive,this is nice streamlined mouse it is responsive and rolls smoothly

positive,high quality head phones excellent product highly recommended 
positive,the sound is great and the battery last long time 
neutral,the colors were great while it worked the wheel broke and the usb fell apart when pulling it out of the computer 
neutral,i used the product for gaming and streaming have not had issue yet and would recommend purchasing these for any gamers 
positive, edit the company did reach out to me to tell me they are getting new supplier maybe the mic will work better for future customers they offered replacement refund as well but have already purchased new headset that works lot better they also tried to talk me into deleting the below review but it was my honest experience with the headset that received original review this worked well for very short while but now the microphone is way too quiet and nobody can hear me in discord the sound quality through the headphones is still good but can use it to game with other people because they can hear me it such shame it also doesn have an option to use the laptop microphone instead of the headset so can just use it for the headphones 
neutral,mousewheel doesn work yikes
neutral,i actually really love this mouse its slim and quiet the multicolored led lights stopped working after days but it does not affect the quality of it just bummer they dont work anymore 
positive,love this speaker and its waterproof 
neutral,make sure to fix your settings on your system
negative,this is the worst mouse every charged it over night with the usb still in my computer and then when got up to use it in the morning it wasn turning on 
neutral,it looks good and like the lighted keys when need to use my computer at night for short time no longer have to turn on the light 
neutral,excelente
neutral,this mouse is unusable for someone who wishes to work efficiently it tracks completely erratically and is simply not worth using 
negative,when opened the box containing the product bunch of white powder feel out not sure what it is but it very unsettling checked for silica packet or something it could have come from but found nothing washed really well but my hands are itching now might be an allergic reaction 
neutral,battery lasts forever smooth and sleek design if you use the middle mouse button it little hard to click but that literally the only downside would recommend this mouse to anyone else looking for an affordable sleek mouse 
negative,first hours of having it couldn get it to charge and isnt usable while on the charging cord completely useless do not buy this cheap junk if there was zero stars button it would be ticked 
positive,great quality and good bass for speaker it size
neutral,it felt like it would break easily and the texture of the mouse would get dirty quickly 
neutral,performs as expected
positive,love it
positive,i have bought the clips speaker for working in the yard and to put on my golf bag also purchased jbl big and jbl charge all are excellent speakers can connect and large speakers not available for clips 
neutral,not what you want do not order nothing explained correctly at all you cannot light it up unless you can play your box looking at it from behind usb only for the light computer usb too many wires and too short too enjoy do not buy you will be very disappointed buy lot from amazon but will not buy bengoo products ever again 
neutral,the mouse doesn work now and am outside the return window disappointed beasue like the feel of the mouse and the sleek design
neutral,kind of flaky sometimes it lights up and other times 
positive,bought this mouse because when my other one died remember having to change my battery at least once month after getting this originally charged and has kept the charge for almost month now and just had to recharge for the st time charged overnight and working great again love this small quiet mouse easy to hold with rubberized texture that keeps it from slipping 
positive,i love it it works perfect and love that it changescolors if you want

neutral,i liked the color and the lights but unfortunately the scroll wheel went out on me this item only lasted me little over months 
positive,this bluetooth speaker is better than expected sound quality battery is very good it beats the competition very happy with this speaker 
neutral,i purchased this keyboard in nov and have really loved it it is quiet and well back lit and just fun to use because of how colorful it is sad to say it less than year in it will no longer hold charge so it is only usable when plugged in still good buy but just sad that it didn last year
neutral,the keyboard must be either front left or right of the keyboard not behind you like to use my computer while kicking up my legs with my wireless keyboard on my lap can do it well all the time because of the range is so poor on this keyboard would need to move the entire tower another part of the room to suit my sitting style or buy usb extender and hopefully move the signal usb stick that comes with the keyboard to in front of me than my tower being behind me 
neutral,i purchased this in february it began tracking poorly in july and stopped scrolling in august 
negative,keyboard worked great for the longest time but ive had it for bit over year and now typing is progressively become more difficult due to the lost key presses its got bad enough to affect games now so my player stops and takes stuttering steps before returning back to normal for short while 
neutral,worked great after first charge then became choppy and uncontrollable very disappointed in this mouse

positive,this is great mouse easy to use runs very smoothly and the color matched my keyboard perfectly would recommend this product to anybody 
negative, month update this thing squeals now it took me week to figure out why kept hearing high pitched whine every time moved my cursor and eventually realized that something inside the mouse is creating very high pitched squeal every time move it that on top of the mouse dying in about day of use now means that this thing is no go definitely buy something else this thing has been total headache since got it the battery on this mouse doesn seem to last very long time after about two days of usage it ll die find myself plugging it in every night to make sure don have to deal with that additionally the thing goes to sleep after about minute or two without movement super annoying you have to click the mouse to wake it up again and doing so registers click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep can recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading you ll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about million times

positive,excellent price an very comfortablethere are great
positive,sleep mode turns on too fast for me however really enjoy the mouse overall just use for work travel not gaming 
neutral,not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse have ever had the displeasure of holding the usb type adapter is loose fitting piece of junk not even worth the hassle of returning this piece of garbage only flashes red for second then quits doing anything else even after being charged for hours have attached it to different devices and nothing guess you get what you pay for and this instance junk
positive,not as loud as expected but quality of sound is excellent 
neutral,good sound
neutral,i bought this specifically because it said it was quiet keyboard not even close it is no more quiet than normal keyboard false advertising and false description of the product have quiet hp keyboard and thought this one would be like that one because of the description this one went back in the box and ordered another hp wireless elite keyboard wish had just ordered another hp in the first place but got fooled by the false description in the headline of this keyboard 
positive,came in new condition and everything works perfectly awesome 
positive,its really light weight and you don hear the mouse clicks however the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse didn have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn have visible battery so used the tip of knife to pop the usb out almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out you may do better job than me 
positive,it fits my hand and the light show is cool 
positive,compared to bose and its prices this one is half the price but as good as the bose nothing to complain 
positive,this little speaker has great sound we use it by the pool all the time while we haven dropped it in the water it has gotten splashed and has been fine two years later and the battery still lasts hours 
negative,after only months my mouse no longer works am so upset because loveddddd this mouse it slim and fits in my laptop bag easily and everything it checked off everything on my list but no matter how long charge it now it will flash and stop working so sad and now the return window has passed and now can even return it 
positive,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from usb port rather than lugging around extra batteries 
negative,so my jbl ve owned for about less than month now and now the speaker itself doesn charge at all the cords work with other devices just not the speaker assume jbl uses bad batteries for their devices regardless this is unacceptable for portable speaker at that price tldr just bought the speaker this month battery already having issues charging
neutral,is better

neutral,sound very clear
positive,just perfect

neutral,feels and looks cheaply made not to mention it broke in less then week 
positive,i ordered this keyboard few months ago and absolutely love it mainly use my keyboard for school and casual gaming it charges quickly and lasts very long time the connectivity was simple and consistent and the quality was just as good if not better than my boyfriends corsair keyboard that is nearly four times the price they keyboard itself has great feel to it the keys are not too loud and it does not have that cheap hollow plastic feeling like most budget gaming keyboards do what makes this product even better is the excellent company behind it few weeks ago my dongle stopped working highly likely it was user error commute with my laptop quite bit and tend to forget to remove my dongle reached out to their incredibly friendly customer service and after some troubleshooting and confirming it was not software problem they promised to send me out new dongle once they got back in stock week or two went by and just when thought maybe was out of luck received an email from lolita informing me that since their replacement dongles were still out of stock they would be shipping me brand new keyboard had the new keyboard at my doorstep in two days just in time for my online mid term in my experience most tech companies completely forget about their customers or blow them off when it comes to little things like this already loved my klim keyboard but we are now officially klim household highly recommend buying their products 
neutral,my mouse worked for months and on the third month it wasn scrolling anymore and the mouse itself was just falling apart don spend you money on this item 
positive,this is the best gaming headset we have purchased to date durable good noise cancellation great sound we ve had these for little over year and compared to others we ve gotten on amazon with great reviews these are the only ones that live up to their star ratings we now own the orange and the purple pairs and have recommended this particular set to friends who have purchased as well good buy can say enough good things

positive,seems like this is solid keyboard so far the build quality is lighter than would like it to be but solid enough 
neutral,i like the items just want them to send me one that actually works but after nd one they don have that option so guess ll buy different brand that all works not just some 
positive,cute light weight very easy to use love this mouse 
positive,omg love this mouse it works great with my laptop just plug in the little key into the usb port and hello really like that it rechargeable so saving ton on batteries can use it while it charging though the clicks are very quiet so don annoy even myself with the noise and love looking at it because of the colors added of course you can turn off the pulsing colors to save charge but who would want to unless you needed to also it bit small good for travel and fits woman hand if you re man this mouse may be bit too small even if it looks cool for gaming as much as use my hp laptop this mouse is must christa
positive,my boyfriend bought these for gaming and he likes them the only thing he has said is that it feels like it squeezing his ears maybe they re little tight but other than that he loves them he literally wears them for hours sometimes so don think the ear thing is that serious 
positive,update lost my favorite mouse today bought it on jun reviewed it aug and it died yesterday aug so the mouse lasted appx weeks two and half months is pretty disappointing lifespan the battery died so plugged it in as always yet it doesn connect anymore ve tried removing the usb transmitter rebooting the computer plunging it in and out and turning it off and on but nothing even tried re charging it but nope it lost cause bought this mouse to replace the wireless logitech was using for my laptop it died and decided to try this rechargeable mouse from okimo never heard of the brand but impressed this first charge lasted so long that almost forgot it was rechargeable bought it in mid june it aug today and just on my second charge the first charge lasted over month this mouse does shut off after it idle for while and sure that is the secret to the long battery life just quick left click and it back in business almost immediately love the slim feel of this mouse it works beautifully thought the changing light would bother me old but it doesn it more like pleasant subdued highlight effect ll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so don get them mixed up 
positive,awesome speaker that plan on purchasing again for myself the one bought was for my girlfriend but hours battery life is straight up lie did mention the speaker sounds great with great bluetooth range and controls love this thing so much also my girlfriend probably doesn know the best practices of maintaining the longest battery life possible 
neutral,terrible

positive,these headphones are amazing for their price have been using them for fortnite and roblox the mic works great and the sound quality is overall good would highly reccomend for any gamer 
positive,i purchased this speaker over other portable options specifically because it had an aux input when using this input the speaker has the brilliant design of shutting off when the signal falls below certain threshold this threshold is very high and the the shut off happens basically immediately the result is continuous stuttering of whatever you re listening to which is absolutely unbearable searching online many people experience this some are able to solve it by cranking up the volume all the way up this didn work for me apparently you can remove resistor on the circuit board to disable this built in feature but just returned my unit instead jbl was useless when it came to customer support won be purchasing any products from them in the future and don recommend you do either 
positive,the sound quality is really good but the ear piece is little small over all got this for gaming and recommend you should get it

neutral,the left mouse button is impossible to use cannot click and drag it does not respond to double click what nightmare would not recommend this at all was very excited for wireless no battery mouse will be returning this 
neutral,easy to charge and to use 
negative,i just got these mins ago and tried them first off it doesn light up unless you plug both ends into port which means console players won get the light up second it just all around horrible with its sound thee most quiet whisper like sound bought it on the grounds of the high rating and good reviews but it didn come close to standards don know if this is just defective or what but this ain it and am quite disappointed in the money just gave to company that couldn even hold standard for gaming 
neutral,they didn work they aren loud and they are really confusing to use but too priority is the fact that they are not remotely loud or noise canceling they don work
positive,we love it great product actually wish had discount so can order more
positive,best bluetooth speaker ever had 
positive,it cheap my right click requires more force than my left the leds aren that vibrant not ergonomic it decent mouse but wouldn recommend it for gaming

neutral,it sounds good
positive,does exactly what needed it to do good sound quality fits snuggly only minor complaint is the length of the cord but that on me for not just hooking it up in the back and honestly in hindsight that more of gripe then complaint definitely not something hold against the product
positive,i bought this mouse for both my year old boy who is gamer and my year old daughter who we just bought gamer computer for so far this mouse is awesome we love the light up option on the mouse it enhances the gaming experience the mouse is lightweight and works great in terms of functionality so glad bought it

neutral,another piece of china junk sold through amazon charged until the light went off mouse charged plugged it in and it stopped working minutes later did the same thing second time same result thanks amazon for continuing to peddle garbage products to your customers 
positive,positive quality great color
positive,they work just fine nice price
negative,update have been sent emails from the seller begging me to change my review of the emails offered me to do so this explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product the mouse freezes constantly left and right click will work but the mouse will not move this is the worst mouse ve ever had it also goes into sleep mode after minutes of not being used which is annoying and no way to turn it off the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn make sense the charge doesn last very long at all charging it every couple of days 
neutral,great sound and size my grandson trying to steal mine so just ordered him one for his birthday 
neutral,easy to use with sleek design 
positive,dig it love it still can adjust my fingers so that not pressing the key when want to hit enter because my hands are trained on wider keyboard oop did it again

positive,this is the best purchase have ever spent 
neutral,easy to use
negative,after exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse the lights are kind of distracting not necessary however it does stay charged for week or more at time cheap and bought this for data work it works other than the middle wheel now and is okay for the price or if you don have high expectations 
positive,my mouse decided to stop working and forced me to have to get new one found this one and thought would give it try am so glad that did it sleek and stylish and love that it lights up would highly recommend this to anyone who wants sleek and fun mouse 
positive,headphones did not light up and mic did not work disappointing because it was christmas gift for my son

neutral,i dont dislike nothing of it
neutral,definitely holds charge the day it arrived put it in charge and it still going weeks later on single charge 
positive,for gaming the mic works nice and connects to xbox one controller very comfortable on ears great sound quality 
negative,the headphones themselves are okay but the microphone is horrible it not flexible or adjustable in any way so you can actually get close enough to it to sound better than muffled to anyone else in voice chat it sounds like you re speaking through wad of cotton or from another room have no idea how this has gotten so many five star reviews when the microphone is so so bad 
positive, update to prior review this mouse started out great was so excited about it at first then after couple months in all of the sudden the usb that goes into the computer just snaps breaks and ll add did nothing to it one day while working from home moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn functioning looked to see why then saw the usb had just cratered into couple pieces so now paid for nothing good lord my own money too not something my office will reimburse me for either nice work

positive,i using it at work and all day the battery lasted days before recharge ordered another one for home this is good product with good price
neutral,horrible bought key board and within hours it stopped working amazon was great and replaced the keyboard the replacement lights do not work 
neutral,the sound is fine for the money but the microphone is really bad we had to go into the sound settings and turn up the gain ton just to make it to where people could here the user on comms thus the sound quality is garbage with all the background noise 
neutral,i had intended on buying megaboom but got to test out this speaker along with boom and megaboom and the fullness of sound in particular the quality of the bass on this thing blew those two out of the water the non universal charge cord is little annoying but oh well don expect to get sub bass out of this thing it would have to be about inches taller for that 
positive,i bought this mouse for my macbook and it would not even turn on charged it all day and it would not work or connect to my laptop it just flashed red color like the battery was dead and that was that happened save yourself some money and look for another mouse elsewhere should ve just gone to best buy or target 
positive,needed mouse for my laptop lights are awesome 
neutral,these were really nice in the beginning don use my headset often for personal reasons somehow this magically has short in it the sound was never that great and always static like anyway 
neutral,replaced my boring mouse with this one wanted something rgb and rechargeable love it so far 
positive,wireless mouse went out ordered this one arrived early feels good in hand easy to control the lights are cute as they change colors lol but the overall feel is good not huge and the recharge is most def the highlightthank you

neutral,this is cheap product don buy it
positive,it works like charm sound is great and works very well all together

neutral,this came all scratched up and feels very cheap 
neutral,excelente
neutral,product performs as stated seller was fast and reliable no issues 
neutral,while it nice mouse fits well it junk it died in less than month purchased two so called upgraded updated don waste the money it junk 
positive,constant clicking sounds and static over the microphone this product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap mm design with no qc over it the sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound maybe you can get lucky and get headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even little bump here or there will easily knock it off place good luck taking your chances with this product 
positive,hubby got this as bithday gift as an avid gamer he fell in love with it the mic was great and canceled all of the background noise including our month old crying 
positive,very nice keyboard for the price like the angle it not to steep so you it comfortable on your wrist for extended typing the keys have nice feel to them as you type the backlights help while typing in the evening it pretty nice keyboard for maybe someone starting to build gaming pc setup at the current price think you get good value the charging cable could be bit longer but the battery has lasted good amount of time so haven had the need to charge it too often yet 
positive,good buy only thing don like is for connector for the upgraded usb is huge and hangs off laptop quite bit otherwise was good buy
neutral,people are right this is rip off waste of money it only worked for week wow

positive,amazing sound quality happy purchase 
positive,it great to take music and podcasts with me in whatever room or location at 
positive,i just used this mouse for work few hours day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when flipped the switch after just days plugged it in to charge like done few times before and the blue light came on when the blue light went off unplugged it and switched it on but it flashed red couple of times and wouldn work repeated the process with the same outcome know it cheap mouse but wow got less than one day of use for every dollar spent 
positive,great sound quality
positive,my son loves them 
neutral,i use this for occasionally gaming with some buddies they constantly complain they can hardly hear me ve only used the headset few times and microphone does not work well wish could return but beyond the days 
positive,best pair of gaming headphones my boyfriend has ever had 
positive,was going back and forth trying to figure out which jbl speaker to purchase finally settled on the charge because all the jbl products are great and it has been the best purchase that have made the sound is great and it very loud speaker for its size would recommend to anybody in the market for travel speaker 
neutral,i just got this not very long ago it just stopped tracking on the page and just out right quit it is piece of junk to me and would never buy this again am not happy and wasted my money on this 
positive,excellent for the price lighted keyboard keys are great quiet key clicks responsive 
neutral,nothing wrong with this mouse does the job use with new laptop 
neutral,i don like the fact have to charge it to use it it pain if don remember to plug it in 
positive, love it plug in and go works on my work computer with no problem will purchase from them again
negative,battery seems bad
neutral, at first really liked this mouse it was lightweight and had sleek design it ended there every time go to use the mouse throughout the day have to return it on even when it already in the on position anyone that is used to any other type of wireless mouse and you just use it anytime will quickly become annoyed with this mouse the fact that you have to flip the switch on and off every time you go to use it makes it poor choice 
positive,i love this jbl speaker it has really good sound and it plays super loud 
negative,i bought pairs of these as gifts and both pairs were major pain in the to connect to pc for gaming sound quality is very decent for price but would not reorder due to connectivity issue do not even know how finally got it to work my pc settings are whack now but they have headset to use mic is not the greatest must speak loudly to hear and does not shut off even when button is switched off 
neutral,never worked returned
positive,fits my hand perfectly the color changing lights are fun addition to every day boring mundane task the black mouse is sleek and soft love it
neutral,in the second week it stoped to work and the item is very light wouldn never buy it again or from this seller
positive,if you own an xbox or ps gaming console do not waste your money on this headset does it work with either gaming system technically yes you can plug it into your controller and use the microphone and speakers to play games however you will not be able to plug the usb into your controller for the led lights the dual plugs are designed to be used on computer gaming system you would have to get very long usb extension cord to plug into your console unless you own pc gaming system save your money and buy something another headset 
neutral,i loved this but ve only had it two months and it stopped working 
neutral,the scroller broke after weeks of intermittent use approximately hours per day days per week 
neutral,had for less than month and will not work keeps turning off
positive,easy to set up and use like the slim design 
negative,worst mouse ever it double clicks when do not want it to the mouse barely moves and is jerky when used and often makes the cursor slide to the upper right of the screen without me moving the mouse 
positive,sounds great and is very portable
neutral,got one as gift and almost hate the one give me this garbage
positive,i love it 
positive,i ve had this mouse since august and don like writing reviews until ve had the item for bit this mouse worked great and love how quiet it is however about weeks ago it started giving me trouble find myself tapping it with medium force on the desk in order for the cursor to move charge it completely and even completely charged it gives me these issues 
positive,headphones are fantastic still working on getting the microphone configured on my son computer 
positive,the back light is very nice some of the top keys don have the clearest numbering lettering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor wish the back light had an adjustable sleep timer one charge lasts long time and you can still use the keyboard while it plugged in for charging the charging cable isn very long but can easily be combined with usb extension cord the ergonomic design and curved keys offer comfort during many hours of use 
positive,when bought it expecting it to last more than month then last week noticed something wasn right sure enough the end oof the wire that plugs into the pc was breaking and really was happy with it at first not having to buy batteries for it 
positive,love these jbls great sound
positive,the texture is very good to hold and mostly very quiet feel very good about this shopping experience the shipment was very fast and it arrived much earlier than expected 
positive,used these for gaming for my son quality is great 
neutral,same poor quality as giveaway bluetooth speaker how can something so average be so expensive 
neutral,the mouse will not charge and it feels cheaply made 
positive,grandson loved it
negative,unfortunately this mouse stopped working after month of use can replace the item or get refund 
positive,just what needed use this keyboard at the office as prefer keyboard with raised keys super responsive and works well 
neutral,no complaints
positive,i like how sleak it is the sleep mode helps the battery life it seems to recharge pretty fast and work on almost any surface happy with it and will be ordering more for my dvr 
neutral,the charge for this mouse only lasts day very annoying and it isnt the most quiet either feels cheap performs meh dont waste your money 
positive,i love this mouse sleek design and quiet clicks make it perfect will probably buy another one 
positive,i had the jbl charger so thought that the would be even better because longer batter life but was wrong the charge had better sound quality clear sound and great bass not so with the charge so sent it back and bought something else 
positive,my kid loves them he was super happy with the fit look and sound
positive,the sound quality is ok and by that mean there is some surround sound left right but not so much full directional and that pretty important to know teammates said mic sounded ok downside is the mic is short and stiff maybe that will protect it better the mic is adequate and good for the price now for the meat of this review the ear covers are stiff and tiny they wrap around my year olds ears great not mine though it actually painful to wear these longer than minutes so don plan to game long with these if you have tiny ears or are under years old then these are for you of you re an adult move on ended up spending more for razer kraken headset and omg let me tell you for the price think got the value the sound quality of the razer headset is just miles ahead of these garbage bengoos you try these trashy bengoos and then try some razer krakens with surround and you will blow your mind of the quality difference not just in sound quality but also in build quality the mic the comfort of the ear muffs just wow would have paid the price difference if knew beforehand how big difference there is between trashy cheap bengoos and actual good quality headsets like razer never going back from razer ll buy them again and again for life now that know 
negative,it was cool when it worked but it stopped working in less than month there were times where would leave it on all night or till the battery died but it doesn charge and the bottom red light just blinks and then shuts off when try to turn it on 
positive,it is okay the scroll wheel and clicker are quiet but the mouse emits super high frequency noise any time it moves have become aware of it and can stand using it much anymore 
positive,i use this all day during work and then use it to play the sims the evening or on the weekend it charges quickly and the battery lasts so long love that the mouse automatically goes into sleep mode because often forget to turn it off the matte finish is sleek and comfortable have no complaints
neutral,this was an awesome wireless keyboard then after charging it twice it would not charge on the third time thought got dud so got second one same thing happened wish they would charge because they where great keyboards and yes they where on surge protector but as soon as they key board died and put them on the charger no charging light tried few outlets and keep it on over night and nothing 
neutral,very good battery life especially when accidentally leave it on
neutral,good product but the recharging part is inconvenient
neutral,i like the product and the idea too bad that once the charge goes it stops working figured the first one was lemon so got replacement but same issue no idea why but just works for like week and then dies 
positive,so the sound quality is pretty great but the mic seems to be picking up voices from the games play have to lower the dialogue volume if that is an option if not have to turn down the whole game volume to get the mic to not pick it up through the headphones perhaps if the mic was further away from the headphones but because it is so short it seems to pick up voices from games or videos really easily edit so the mute toggle on the cord does not prevent this audio pickup from the mic it completely stops my voice and sounds from my environment but it somehow is still picking up voices from games or videos even when the mute toggle is on 
positive,had it for week and it was great until it started just randomly inputting keys and became unusable do not buy 
negative,i am very much casual gamer but even so would not recommend this keyboard to anyone latency is awful keystrokes are either missed or repeated which means wouldn even use this for office applications yeah it is cheap guess except that you might as well set your on fire why not save little more and get something of quality that will actually hold up to the task for which you bought it also you know it mediocre junk when amazon does not even want it sent back as return 
positive,i don like using my mouse on my laptop so having mouse is helpful and then it lights up 
neutral,scroll stopped working after weeks of use
neutral,worked great the first week stopped holding charge and working after the second week sent back after month of having because it wasn worth the effort of charging to full only for it to work for hours if at all can even have it plugged in and charging while using so that wasn even possible work around bought different brand and have been using for few months without any issues don waste your time with this wireless keyboard 
negative,absolute garbage listen to the negative reviews and the ones saying the company is spamming them begging to remove their posts the lights are haywire with no pattern randomly switching off and on dpi is not adjustable pretty sure that lie feels like the lowest grade plastic ve ever felt does not track lights will give you seizure without doubt this company is scamming you 
positive,i am so happy with it it fits well in my hand it goes in to sleep mode so it saves power and that is amazing cus fall asleep lot when am on my laptop am college student and it is amazing for it its small and really smooth the light feature is amazing when it is off that when use it it still has rad light emit when using it and love it sooo much am definitely in love with the product 
positive,great slim line wireless mouse pairs well with all computers easy to charge and sleep mode is plus highly recommend
neutral,battery dies way too fast 
positive,a great value 
positive,very long range bluetooth super smooth for laptop gaming totally recommended 
positive,this product works intermittently ve made sure to charge it and even with full charge it won click every time when try to do so or it will get stuck with and without mouse pad 
negative,mouse is tiny in my hand scroll wheel broke within the first week usb plug is terrible the worst ive ever had to deal with upon trying to remove the wireless usb plug from any any the top half come out but the metal part stays stuck in the plug this has happened repeatedlyi just bought different mouse
positive,it very nice wireless mouse very quite the color is very nice too like it so much
positive,love the lights and it comfortable to use 
neutral,good
negative,update have been sent emails from the seller begging me to change my review of the emails offered me to do so this explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product the mouse freezes constantly left and right click will work but the mouse will not move this is the worst mouse ve ever had it also goes into sleep mode after minutes of not being used which is annoying and no way to turn it off the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn make sense the charge doesn last very long at all charging it every couple of days 
positive,the sound quality of this is really amazing and has great bass response don know how they do it but highly recommend it it great having in the kitchen while cooking 
neutral,what item do musically hip teenagers want more than any other item this 
positive,i ve had this headset for couple weeks so far say it is working very well sound quality is good there is no active noise cancellation but don feel that it would be necessary can hear everything clearly without turning the volume up too high the higher you go the more distortion you will hear as expected at first wasn getting the microphone to work unplugged the splitter from the single mm aux plug and re connected it after plugging both audio cables from the splitter in again everything worked as intended for those who aren familiar make sure the pink connector goes into the microphone port and green goes into the headset port this review is based on using the headset on pc have not tried using it with anything else at this time also there is toggle switch next to the volume dial on the headset make sure it is switched on microphone symbol without line through it if you plan to use the microphone overall would recommend this headset it is priced very reasonably and it meets my needs 
positive,the slime design makes it easy to transport the usb piece fits nicely under neither when it goes into sleep move just click the button and its back up and running 
neutral,this is my second jbl charge use mine at the pool it completely waterproof it been thrown in the pool and never stops playing works about hours between charges and now that have connect them together for surround sound 
positive,it was great present for friend of mine because while gaming he couldn talk because his old expensive headset broke fast so far it been few months and this still works for him he sounds better and the quality is also good not sure how noise cancelation is going for him though 
neutral,poor quality does not hold charge has sleek design but mouse does not work as intended 
positive,great set of headphones for the gamers our house fit and sound are great my grandkids love the comfort feel the sound and mic are good 
positive,works great
positive,update definitely noticeable sound differences between the speakers the model is flatter and doesn get as loud as the model it also has muffled sound to it so far have received bad customer service from jbl the seller bought from electronics expo an authorized dealer has week return policy so outside of that and thus far jbl won even admit they are selling different models to customers sent pictures and even links to fcc filing pages and the customer service reps don even acknowledge it they want me to do factory resets and firmware updates it different hardware all they offered me was some coupon and told me to deal with the seller this is the last time ll ever purchase jbl product and surely will urge friends and family to steer clear of them as well original pictures included just so people are aware there are different models of the actual speaker you may get with this it seems legitimate based on the fcc filings page but want people to understand in case they notice differences like did when put them side by side the model number on the box itself is the same jblchargeblkam but jbl is shipping different speakers inside the box and not telling people there is model and model the boxes themselves are nearly identical besides the small qr code next to the serial number on the model if you open the charging port flap and look on the left side next to the serial number you will see which one you have now if you only order one speaker you probably never know but if you order of them and receive different models the differences are obvious charges the looks to be the older model according to fcc filings this has mah battery inside from my personal observations the mesh on the outside is thicker and you cannot see through it at all it also feels bit heavier in the hand don have digital scale to measure exactly but it definitely more dense the charging indicator lights are also much brighter you can see this in the pictures chargej the seems to be the newer model this is the model that actually has mah battery inside the mesh is not as thick on this model and you can easily see the speaker components inside also the charging lights on this model are much dimmer compared to the it feels bit lighter in the hand as well haven put them through the ringer yet to see if there are audio differences it would be very disappointing if there are so buyer beware jbl is selling different speakers with different battery sizes that potentially sound different but they are marketing it as the same product wish would have known this before bought them 
neutral,i think everything else was good about this it just that my charger broke really quick and now do not have charger for this it is hard to find charger for this product would make charger stronger because it is really inconvenient for the user would recommend if charger was built with durability 
positive,i love it 
positive,excellent sound quality easy bluetooth connection battery life is great 
neutral,broke in less than months scrolling won workwouldn recommendquit right outside the return window
neutral,product quit working after using it for only week it would go on then turn off while typing not good when in the middle of game
positive,works fine but it feels like toy kid would use super light and made with thin cheap plastic
positive,update have upped my review from to since reached out to the seller and they offered to send replacement usb dongle will update the review again once that has been received would have given this mouse five stars month ago but yesterday when removed the usb dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless tried to piece it back together but it won stay together it shame because this mouse is really cool looking feels nice in my hand and holds charge long time very disappointed 
positive,a gift but he loved it
positive,standard wireless mouse works well what really like about it is the colored light at the sides 
positive,this is fair to middling keyboard the back lighting only works when it is plugged in some folks think the back lighting is just gimmicky bling thing but in darkened room its necessary and if you go cordless no back light would rather have truly cordless model with lots of batteries prefer the heft this one is very light adding to sense of cheapness it is compact still room for improvement will try another when tire of this one still searching for the one would re order this ain it but still reasonable value 
positive,if you want cheap light up mouse then get this one when it on sale definitely not worth the price otherwise it very quiet and slim but that about where the benefits outweigh the cost the actual lighting is not what advertised it actually pretty dim even in dark room beyond that whenever you move the mouse the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse taking over the other colors being displayed additionally with the hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity you be better off buying nicer mouse for the same price
positive,i just love this wireless mouse it not big and bulky the clicking is quite and it really cute looking 
positive,i had issue with the keyboard but received the replacement so fast with quick response really good quality for this price so you can have better keyboard with higher pricing but may not satisfy your pricing range 
positive,i bought this mouse for my wife but loved it so much that had to get second for myself it has really great feel and it works really well
positive,my nephews headset was giving him issues so ordered one of these and received it fast and he is very happy
positive,constantly had to charge cool light effects came at cost ended up going to target and buying one that works much better and is battery operated 
positive,this was great purchase would gladly buy it again if had to 
neutral,got my computer hooked up to the tv so its nice to have this on the nightstand and it light up at night 
neutral,i honestly got this product not so long ago and can really speak about the durability but wasn disappointed with my purchase the battery last for very long time and the light it just beautiful 
neutral,sleek looking with lights but scroller on one did not work 
positive,bought as gift for great grandson and he loves it 
positive,jbl charge pros conspros nothing cons price is crazy hi because there harmon kardon backed volume is trumped by bugani for exactly half the price battery life is awful fully charged this up went to work on hour shift battery died twice charged first time at lunch for minutes died again hours later expected but initial overnight bar charge did not last hours dunno sound subpar compared to the existing bugani had it lasts twice as long battery wise and is wayyy louder clearer and treble is def better bass better on the bugani imo they messed up on this bigtime worth maybe not no way bugani now that ordered second in stereo at the shop wow next level guys are like wow who makes those amazing for the price of charge 
neutral,provides good volume range 
neutral,light never turned on came dirty
neutral,the speaker wont stay connected for more than minute without having to reconnect
neutral,i purchased this item in august the usb plug completely fell apart and can no longer use the mouse 
positive,work really well love it
positive,sounds great and charge lasts longer than other speakers ve owned awesome has built in phone charger as well
neutral,i purchased this item for my office so could play some background music while work work better with some low background music the speaker is great the only issue ve had is the speaker took forever to charge and after while the battery wouldn charge all the way read online that if you have this problem you need to try using different charging cord and charging plug so bought new charging plug and cord it worked and now the speaker charges just fine the charging cord that comes with the speaker may not be strong enough and you may need another charging cord and plug 
neutral,strictly gaming
positive,i love the design and ease of use older so am used to using mouse this works perfectly 
positive,love this mouse got it to replace my logitech mouse because it was glitching you can beat the price for this one it light weight and the colors are nice 
neutral,i acknowledge that this isn the loudest speaker jbl has to offer but with that being said let me just say that for the size of this thing there is no better speaker available period 
positive,bought as gift for our son he loves them they work perfectly while he plays his games can hear what he playing or watching and he can hear me when tell him to do chores 
positive,amazing head phones love them but sometimes it starts to echo on my ps but it fixes it self if lower the volume little other than thst they are amazing for that price
positive,bought for my son for christmas and he loves them they are his favorite color and they shine bright he can really hear his friends well when he uses them 
positive,great so far use it for my macbook pro and really enjoying it great touch and super lightweight 
positive,perfect speaker loud clear and it sure bumps for the size 
positive,overall love this mouse the size weight clicking is all fabulous however ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use it wasn dropped literally was not even touching it the second time and heard it fall if you need to use the middle scroller lot do not recommend purchase if you don use that feature then it great mouse 
positive,i really enjoy the mouse with the different colors that light up when clicking the left or right buttons on the mouse it is very quiet 
neutral,i ordered this mouse in april and it no longer holds charge 
positive,love it as expected 
negative,i purchased this little over months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than than weekend days so started turning it off about months later noticed lagging in click response soon after clicks were not engaging replaced it with brand name you get what you pay for but thought should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement it been over weeks now and no response do not recommend this product or its manufacturer beware 
positive,great keyboard as use primarily for my pc 
positive,my son loves it comes with extra cords too 
negative,i work from home and this is great mouse overall it super slim and it lights up but it not super bright that it bothering you 
positive,i really want to like this mouse even more than do the colors are cute but it has flicker that just goes consistently wish could continue to use this but think am going to have to get something else the flicker drives me nuts charged it fully and there is no reason it should not work when just got it today it would also be nice if the charge cord was long enough that you could use it while it was charging 
positive,great
neutral,this was birthday present for my son one ear piece has already quit working and the microphone is now staticky sounding and his friends can understand him of course the return window has already closed not happy 
positive,been wearing these for multiple hours day and they are comfortable the sound is good too minus is there is no pause play button on the cord but it has mic on and off switch which is nice 
neutral,we have tried to plug them into different controllers and still can get the mic to work on them and when the mic works you can hear anything
neutral,the sound of these speakers are mediocre to poor the bluetooth connection continually misfires and sound dissolves into static was surprised that this kind of speaker gets good marks 
neutral,it worked good at first but it will not respond anymore even after being fully charged waste of money it cute though good thing it stopped working right away so can still return it 
positive, pros quiet smooth no delays or lagging issues so far pretty colors when not moving the mouse cons seems bit cheap little flatter than like doesn fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable the red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you re moving the mouse want to see the various colors even when moving the mouse not red led light shining through which is overpowering some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show the right side of the mouse right handed doesn emit the colors as vividly as the left side next to my thumb one small section is almost inoperative ll probably be returning it as have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn emit the red led like this one it was super cheap fortunately in case keep it who knows guess you get what you pay for 
positive,great product for the price would definitely recommend it 
positive,really disappointed with this product loved it when got it it fit my hand nicely worked like dream then it came time to charge it no matter where plugged it in could not get it to charge not sure if it is just faulty product or if this is just how they are 
neutral,we tried several different ways to charge it and it would not hold charge over minutes 
neutral,this mouse worked great for months then the scroll wheel broke don waste your money 
neutral,works well when charged nearly impossible to charge though the port connection must be off 
positive,really enjoyed the sound of this headset 
neutral,my son is gamer and also used these for school virtual and the sound was lost after about days unfortunate because he was excited also he was unable to plug in the lights because it needed separate extension 
positive,great sound quality and bass very durable and like the more rugged look 
positive,i have only had this few days but so far is been good haven had any connectivity issues the space bar is rather loud for the keyboard being silent it the only key though over all great product for the price would recommend to friends or family 
positive, wish would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before purchased the white one don like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse assumed it would just be line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures if you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you overall do like the mouse and don want to deal with exchanging planned on getting the mint and should have gone with my instincts it glides smoothly and the clicks are slient won be returning it because do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown described
neutral,really like array of colors so purchased mouse for every day workflow not gaming the scroll wheel is bit squeaky that the only flaw not sure if will keep it or put in file 
neutral,my mic does not work and barely any info on how to fix and no help from support
positive,i actually have to walk up to my grandson before he hears me these are great 
neutral,this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emits really high pitched squeal when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help 
positive,just arrive today so far so good the black looks so elegant the bass is heavy and the audio quality it perfect 
positive,very nice and good quality headset the gaming experience and noise canceling and sound quality are amazing
neutral,the sound is great and so are the look and feel the battery last long but not nearly as long as advertised 
positive,he is so happy with his headphones he is gamer and definetely never hears me come in the room lol
neutral,x
positive,i wanted to love these headphones because saw so many good reviews fresh out of the box those blue lights were super cool appreciated that they came with the adapter for headset jack or mic headphone jacks the headset itself was comfy and fit well could hear everything else great except myself default couldn hear myself at all knew to change my windows settings to increase the microphone volume but unfortunately the mic quality is just not there tried to use them to game with my friends and they said sounded worse than the last much cheaper headset that had update returned this headset over months ago and the company has directly emailed me five times claiming their product has since improved and keeps offering me compensation to update take down my amazon review read into this as you will am not interested please stop emailing me 
positive,i use this mouse for casual surfing and scrolling no gaming but it smooth and responsive and looks awesome 
neutral,stopped working within week
positive,edit customer service was very responsive they walked me through resetting it they said if it didn work that would covered under warranty luckily it was quick and easy fix the keyboard worked great for month then it stopped working it won work and it won charge 
positive,i absolutely love how vibrant the lights are and how light weight the mouse is work from home and use this alot 
positive,my bf loves it love that you can use it as charger when out and about the sound qaulity is amazing would recommend 
neutral, paint text didn last full year as they explained keyboard keys started becoming loose to the point you have to click on it really hard to work
neutral,it was just what was looking for
positive,pros super great sound pretty noise cancelling great volume mic is decent for the price and filters out exterior sound pretty wellcons super tight on ears keep having to take them off to pop my ears even though my ears are tiny it works far better with my laptop alienware than my pc ibuypower but doubt that to the fault of the headphones 
positive,this wireless does not use batteries you charge with your laptop when needed there is light that changes color and it pretty cool 
negative,well it was good while it lasted for year but will never buy an off brand wireless gaming keyboard again battery sucks on this keyboard had to charge it at least once week it was so annoying that just left the cable on the keyboard which defy the purpose of getting wireless keyboard then the keyboard would start having weird behavior it would freeze up or if type it would get stuck on letter and repeat it times so done with this junk fyi rarely used this keyboard for gaming only use it for everything web surfing need the illuminated light cause my work space is dark 
positive,great mouse sleek and fun great price 
positive,love how clearly you can hear 
positive,the mouse is very cute and love the colors and the way it lights up went to use it one day and it was out of charge charged it doubt this will last long it was but really worth about 
neutral,item worked well when it worked but it no longer charges after months of use usb on keyboard doesn seem to work anymore now being months from purchase can return it recommend getting different product that may last longer 
positive,works like charm you can change the mouse speed right from the actual device love it 
positive,sounds great holds charge for very long time bluetooth connection was very easy 
positive,great
positive,great
positive,it stopped turning on after months the battery is fine and the buttons clearly work it just has odd power light combinations and suddenly won turn on 
neutral,it is great the only bad things about it is the point that you can change the rgb color
positive,love it
positive,very cool my brother loved it
negative,worked great for about week now won work love the color and that it was quiet click but disappointed that it died 
positive,not bad for the price the top part hits pressure points on the head so you have to move it whwn you feel soreness don twear them for longer than maybe hours so it kinda disappointing but value for what paid is great not bad at all for temporary set 
neutral,very cheap mouse connectivity is poor at times 
positive,the sound from this is great it been to many parties and outside and the beach would highly recommend it bluetooth works great my older parents can even use it with ease getting them one for their anniversary 
neutral,otherwise it seemed to work fine 
neutral,if you want keyboard with backlighting then this is not the keyboard for you it does not stay backlit for more than minute when not being used which is more than annoying and the instructions as to programming it to stay on does not change anything in that regard sent it back and will be returning to tried and true logitech 
positive,i saw all the positive reviews and thought this would be winner at first it was great loved the colors it is easy to use but after few months the scroll wheel stopped working dug little deeper into the reviews and realized this is common theme now have to buy another mouse already and it won be another one of these 
positive,usb doesn go all the way into the port it doesn work at all the headphone jack works for controllers but the microphone sounds like garbage it sounds staticky and muffled 
positive,powerful speaker great sound
neutral,i like that it does not need batteries the battery lasts long time 
positive,these are awesome for how much they cost my only complaint is they get uncomfortable on the ears after playing for more than an hour because the padding is superb but they re awesome for the price so definitely worth it 
neutral,this mouse quit working just one day past the return date and now am stuckusing this mouse as doorstop take my advice and purchase anything but this one 
positive,great sound and the battery seems to last forever only wish you could change songs from the speaker itself but it got great quality sound 
positive,it works better than the bose soundlink revolve used to have better sound quality to include more bass can hear the music throughout my backyard glad purchased it recommend you do as well 
neutral,didn hold charge long but now won recharge at all just threw it in the trash had battery operated mouse for years until lost it going back to batteries 
positive,bought this to use at work and absolutely love it not only are the changing colorful lights pretty cool it works really well however the best part about this mouse is that it is rechargeable bye bye batteries 
neutral,i have had this mouse for all of minutes and am planning on returning it honestly it looks nice and like that it rechargable however it easily one of the worst ve ever used ve used probably different models in my career alone first clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse ve used and on top of that it very inconsistent looking through the gaps where the leds show out of can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is tiny plastic arm no chance that will lasts for an expected period of time it seemed to have been packaged fine so don believe it was damaged or doa don buy this 
negative,this mouse is very light weight but not in good way it so light it actually feels cheap it takes lot of getting use to because it is so light after about three weeks the mouse started to intermittently stop working now it has fully stopped working after only month pay the more and get the microsoft one ve had that one for years and never had an issue 
positive,nice mouse the battery lasts along time before needing recharged and like that do not have to use mousepad with it as it works great even without one

positive, just opened it and connected everything and couldn be happier with them was skeptical but this headset couldn be better and the price made it stars for sure 
positive,initially when ordered this it was pretty bad to be honest however the nice people at bengoo reached out and addressed to me that they have fixed the overall issues had with on the headset they were willing to send me another one after reviewing the new headphones was amazed at the improvement for the price this is definitely headset you want to get your hands on the sound quality is great and the mic quality is very clear am now very satisfied with this purchase if you are looking for reasonably priced top quality wired headsets this one should definitely be taken into consideration

positive,i was super excited for this mouse its so sleek and small it was perfect for me unfortunately it doesn work all that well its super glitchy especially when you turn it on color mode it lags and sometimes it doesn even click on what you re trying to click on its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer

neutral,adorable little mouse however the darn thing will be on and won do anything know to click to wake it if it in sleep mode but half the time it won be asleep and have to click like times for it to start actually working unfortunately ll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience

positive,i love this speaker if your looking for good one this is it 
positive,my grandsons love their new headsets would buy them again 
neutral,i wanted something to take when playing sports seeing how big it was was expecting it to be at least little louder has the loudness of speakers half the size and quarter the price
negative,initially charged this mouse overnight and then used it for two eight hour days turning it off overnight couple hours into using it on day it died charged it for several hours and it has no juice and won even turn on would think after couple hours of charging it would at least turn on 
negative,first one broke immediately same day for another one sent as replacement and that broke in days garbage do not buy

negative,i ordered it on june and at the end of august the dongle broke off of my usb there is still metal piece stuck in the usb 
neutral,when initially got my package the box was open on both sides but thankfully the headphones weren damaged the headphones work great so far and aside from the packaging don have anything negative to say about the product 
positive,perfect
neutral,it didn work for my xbox series put in the adapter and still didn work 
neutral,i just got it ll update after few weeks of using it 
positive,i chose this ergonomic mouse because liked the shape and it seemed to be easy to hold and use when received it was thrilled because it is so colorful also like that it will work with my little mouse pad use for my chrome book have used it since it arrived and am happy with it so far with this mouse can play my games easier and it is also quiet and easy to use recommend this mouse to all am happy customer 
positive,i purchased this keyboard for use with my gaming machine using it upon my lap in chair with arm rests it doesn fit within the boundaries of the arm rests which causes me to be partially rotated to the left to even try and use it wish the keys were more centrally located for my back sake great backlight which dealuminates after use keys are bit clunky an overreach for that satisfying tactile response producing labored finger extension while using wish they would send me one without the number pad as not to interrupt the use of my main machine which use hours every day 
neutral,microphone does not work followed all instructions for set up and troubleshooting still does not work 
positive,i purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when was using it it looked exactly like the mouse in the picture and was easy to charge and use it also held charge for long time which was really happy about the reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for months and then it completely stopped working no matter what did certainly wasn expecting wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least months out of it before it died if you re looking for something cute and short term and don mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you 
negative, the ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing it is lightweight and feels cheap white matches my setup but it translucent and takes way from the aesthetic it is connected less than ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag it makes it completely useless to me don recommend you buy it at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging 
positive,didn buy this for gaming but it smooth mouse which love work from home and utilize this while on my work and home lap tops 
positive,this product does not work with my macbook air it worked last night when first opened the box and it already won keep charge or charge at all buyer beware 
positive,my daughter has one of these and when heard it was blown away awesome sound with deep bass it sounds best up to about of volume but even that is more than plenty of volume the battery is awesome lasting several days and you can charge your phone or ipad without reducing lot of battery life 
positive,came ready to use starting using straight from box it is convenient and ergonomic friendly 
positive,i used this mouse to play minecraft and not long after got it say month the mouse it started slowly malfunctioning this is disappointing considering there were so many good reviews now am in need of another mouse and wish could get my money back because not made of money and thought this would last me while 
negative,battery died after mins with or without the color changing lights on this thing is useless
negative,this headset came with the microphone not even working it wouldn show up on my computer it either the headset is broke or the cord is and on top of that you can hear what going on in the headset even if you re not the one wearing it very disappointed

neutral,i used the mouse after got it for hours and within the first minutes the light srop changing colors it is now only red 
positive,great sound long battery life very portable 
positive,when playing with friends they can barely hear me even when speak loudly the mic itself is very short and only come halfway down my cheek with no way to extend it non functional for online play the sound is fine the quality of the mic as whole isn great but for not bad do not buy for online play 
neutral,i bought wireless keyboard so could play feet away from my desktop it looses it connection often from this distance its pretty frustrating 
neutral,worked well at first few months later all incoming sounds came in sounding like the speakers were blown they just keep getting worse it so difficult understanding people 
neutral,it works for what need so no compliants here 
positive,i got this specifically since it was smaller than the gaming mouse had this slim mouse feels nicer in my hand the only thing is that occasionally the cursor lags jumps bit but it doesn happen too often otherwise love that it chargeable and wireless don keep the flashy lights on too often to conserve the battery nice cheap mouse 
positive,i love it 
positive,exactly as described works great fir my chromebook 
neutral,originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries tried using this mouse for about week when finished using it forgot to plug it in so the next time tried to use it the power was zapped that pretty much defeats the purpose of having cordless mouse with no power had to use it when plugged into my laptop sent it back and got mouse that requires on battery 
positive,got these for my son for the playstation they work perfectly and definitely are noise canceling he can hear me when call him which is semi annoying lol 
negative,have had this less than two months and it doesn work at all after hours of charging computer only recognizes clicks but no movement at all waste 
positive,perfectly acceptable for both business meetings and discord chats but the sound quality isn too good you sound like you re coming from far away other than that it worked for years no other complaints 
neutral,i been using for almost month now spilled water and it said water proof but when press key multiple and wrong letter types try to fix it by dissembling but was not able to fix it it is not water proof so careful 
positive,a well engineered mouse with long battery life good design and cutting edge wireless connectivity very easy to set up and use recommended 
neutral,i have smaller jbl speaker and really enjoy it so decided to get the jbl charge as an upgrade this speaker was surprisingly disappointing the bluetooth function was terrible couldn get consistent listening experience it would cut out despite updating firmware switching wi fi networks forgetting and reconnecting the bluetooth ended up returning the product 
positive,great product my son loves its 
neutral,battery life sound quality are top notch 
positive,very good considering it pretty cheap had mine for almost years and just now having to buy another definitely recommend sound is clear and microphone is pretty good as well 
positive,bought this mouse for work because didn want to use the corded mouse my company gave me not even two months in the mouse scroller breaks never dropped the mouse never did anything but charge it twice week and use it for work had to overnight ship completely different mouse for work the next day very disappointed because really liked the mouse and had even told my coworkers to buy this glad they didn waste their money like did 
positive,my daughter loves it no complaints here 
positive,very good sound and very well made
positive,great product and great value
positive,the headset is very comfortable and the sound quality is great especially for the cost 
neutral,decent speaker way better upgrade than my other ihome speaker the ihome speaker lasted me about years and still works so let see how long this one will last 
neutral,i had an issue with my product but the sellers made it right immediately would buy it again
positive, great for the price very small but fits hand perfectly
negative,there was no usb adapter included so it essentially useless if you need it for usb system 
positive,love the pretty lights just wish that the charge would last longer still even with pretty long hours of gaming and accidentally leaving it on the battery lasts solid hours would recommend good for the price that for sure
positive,got here just in time love the headphones how they fit real good perfect for gaming anytime of day 
positive,i am not using it for gaming but think its cute and love the colors just wish it was little bighter 
positive,grandson loves it
neutral,bought this headset in february and it stopped working no sound comes through the headset at all in april but my son didn tell me about it until july st he used it for his ps 
positive,my son loves it
neutral,a bit tight without widening features 
neutral,listen to the reviews saying it not as good as the cause didn and regret it go with the it overall better 
neutral,this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the cursor around and scroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the hassle of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech 
neutral,i fell in love with the color changing of this product but it kept cutting off and sticking had to return it
positive,adorable mouse it works very well and love that you are able to recharge it the mouse speed is very good and overall very enjoyable to use while working from home 
positive,sounds great easy to set up fast shipping
neutral,all sound etc good
negative,this speaker broke less than month after purchase normal medium volume usage only not pleased
positive,mouse works great better than expected 
positive,i have touchscreen chromebook but still need mouse to use on excel worksheet this is slim easy to use and handy led lights is plus 
positive,i really liked this mouse but had to return the first one because the wheel quite scrolling after it was knocked off my bed onto carpeted soft bedroom floor no big deal they sent me new one and sent the malfunctioning one back well the wheel has quit on this nd one too once bitten and twice shy and all that ll be returning this one as well then be off to find wireless mouse that not so sensitive and will last longer than month it really sinks liked this mouse lot 
positive,excellent audio and performance as well no problems at the start and so far still no problems friends say audio comes out clear so great for chatting with online friends with ease 
positive,i use these for gaming music videos schoolwork pretty much everything spanning both pc and console experiences they work great and still work great after almost year of ownership the chord is tad unwieldy with its length and the headphones aren ideal for noise canceling other than that can find any issues 
negative,the freaking thing broke before could even use it was out of town for few weeks so by the time noticed it the return date had expired 
positive,the mouse is colorful addition to my desk and unlike other computer mice have owned it does not have thumb operated controls on its left side where left handed person like myself would unintentionally press button and start function they didn want to activate ve only had it for about week so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged the light display draws significant amount of power so need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever shut down the pc 
neutral,liked illumation
negative,the mouse was decent for the price however now just about weeks out of my return window and the scroll stopped working on the mouse days ago was hoping it was random temporary issue but it seems it permanent disappointed that can at least return or exchange the item and now have to go and buy new mouse 
positive,it is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud rgb is decent for the price but wish it was brighter overall its decent
neutral,i ordered this mouse in april and it no longer holds charge 
negative,only worked few weeks and thats it waste of money whats worse is barely used it 
positive,this mouse is absolutely done and performed as stated by the seller smooth movement and quiet clicks virtually no sound and love the light show it emits around the mouse if you are looking for great quality and functionality look no further because here it is 
positive, left control does not work in combination with many commands open incognito tab reopen closed tab super annoying wireless connectivity is super questionable even when the dongle less than foot away the enter key is huge not at all comfortable layout
neutral,only had the thing for week and already the mic stopped working can hear them they can hear me have to unplug and replug dozen times for it to work again
neutral,it is little bit but the sound makes up for it
positive,awesome was surprised how easy sound really good very comfortable was surprised how comfortable plush and soft have never used gaming head set hate them there uncomfortable usually buy high end but went cheap thought they would be crap honestly they sound as good as my bose wow
positive,did not realize when ordering that was ordering the same headset currently had it was gift before and really liked it and was upset that the cord had finally messed up and was no longer working correctly after some time using it found great deal for this one online and ordered it within days it was delivered already was very excited when realized it was the exact headset had been using before because loved it they work great are very comfortable have led light option easy controls and was great price as well would definitely recommend and would absolutely purchase again in the future 
neutral,the wheel broke after little over month am not on my laptop too much so don understand it haven even had to recharge it after the first initial charge it great big nope for me 
neutral,sound quality is good
positive,great headphone for the price look awesome and feel great the noise cancellation could be better but for the price can really beat it 
neutral,wanted to match my keyboard and not spend too much money this little number is priced just right and the size and shape make it easy to use 
positive,finally sleep mode that is done right all my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake pretty standard well when wake those other mice with right or left click it is active click which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens menu or activates what clicked always frustrated me lol well this one is super nice you click and it awake without doing an activation or selection have been looking for this in wireless mouse and have finally found it also it has nice feel not super ergonomic but nice the color selection is nice chose the grey the rgb lights are very pleasant to the eyes haven had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but will update soon the cable that comes with the mouse is very short but that isn problem the dbi variety is nice as well very happy with this mouse 
positive,pros good audio quality good volume output cool lightscons can get uncomfortable after long use
negative,product looks as described and is comfortable however two main features are gonna mark this one as return for me the sound quality is bad for both the incoming and outgoing mic audio everything sounds echoey like its in fish bowl also the mute function does not work game audio itself is fine but not great but got these for chatting and wont be able to use it this way pay more get more suppose 
positive,i love it and the multicolored
positive,it smaller than used to and light the battery seems to work well and don turn on and off just goes to sleep it has the enter bar in different configuration and is tighter than than used to and that has been change to get accustomed to like it though 
negative,had this one for week and it already stopped working the scroll wheel in the middle doesn work and half the time the items am trying to click on can because the left click button doesn work have charged it several times from the computer and from wall adapter and still not any better
positive,first off love the color it what made me purchase it in the first place didn need mouse but like having spare now for my review as far as what used to for comfort this mouse sits flat so be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time fits nicely in your hand have medium small hands so please take that into consideration with the review the lights loved the different light modes it actually made it feel like had gaming mouse while not being so hard on my wallet now for push button response my right click wasn working properly barely clicked down and would sometimes mia click from it being mispositioned had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad broke it off and now it is clicking as intended so please be aware this is all very fragile plastic within its housing overall the mouse is great if you need spare and would buy again if needed another hate out of stars because feels worse than but feel an is more accurate to how feel as it has lot of great features such as charging vs batteries and an included usb adapter overall wonderful product that do recommend
negative,i got this in june and it now the end of september it was great at first and lasted multiple days on charge but now the battery dies after just couple of hours and it dies randomly without any warning so it always in the middle of using it frustrating this lasted maybe months in totalupdate again month later this is dead and battery lasts few minutes at most even after charging up fully
neutral,cord is like ft long and constantly gets caught on things or tangled missed that in the description guess would not recommend for console gamers who plug into controllers cord is too long and will become trip hazard 
neutral,it very practical mouse you color is pretty 
neutral,do not drop the mouse on the floor very sensitive and broke right away after having it for year so this is the second one ordered works very well and has cute colors 
neutral,not worth it if you re looking for something to work longer than couple of months my son was able to get couple of months use out of it before the mic stopped working then he would have to hold the cord certain way for him to hear out of one side it wasn worth doing all that so we tossed it since was passed the return deadline would be very weary of those so called stars reviews 
positive,this is an amazing mouse would definitely buy again 
neutral,this product only lights up in red not multi colored as described or shown other than that that it okay 
positive, awesome keyboard only issue have with it is super minor the space bar key is so loud all the other keys are just fine the space bar just doesn have enough connectors for its length so it makes really loud click 
positive,use for my playstation it very comfortable sound is good
positive,i have ton of keyboards and this thing would be perfect if it was wireless but it wired so it almost perfect like it really lot 
positive,sound quality is great and comfortable at good price recommend 
negative,this has less sound outputand quality than jbl flip extremely disappointed with this model it mono and if the jbl logo isn pointing in your exact direction you don get much sound don even bother with the hassle of trying this did it for you 
neutral,out of working in three months
positive,i love it
positive,i don normally like using mouse when am on my laptop but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so decided to purchase mouse when looking for mouse wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back it fits my hand perfectly and enjoy how sleek it looks the only thing that would change is being able to decide the color and color patterns other than that it was worth the purchase 
positive,super sound from budget speaker easy connectivity 
positive,great replacement for the small bose portable speaker that had easy to link with bluetooth and the sound is excellent highly recommend 
positive,i got this for my son in december it worked great until today it keeps dying it lasted months 
negative,the mouse is not effective charged for hours still no life or function do not buy when noticed that the mouse was not working charged it for hours tried the mouse again and it still did not work but showed red as one of the colors which may be warning the seller did not respond or reply to assist me with any troubleshooting unsatisfied customer 
positive,my son loves it its really great for noise cancellation and sound quality its very comfortable
neutral,literally did not work pure garbage
positive,good headset good sound quality works well with my phone 
positive,i really like this mouse it works very well and do like the sleep mode for saving its charge it only less desirable aspect is its cord the connector at the mouse end does not slide smoothly into the connection 
positive,it was gift love it the sound is great have had lot of time to use it but so far it great 
positive,very easy setup nice and stylish great product for the price 
positive,great little speaker for outside we take this speaker with us to the beach and camping the sound is decent and love how rugged it is is plus don have to worry about leaving it out in the rain know that there are speakers out there with better sound but the price of them is also lot higher as for camper and beach life this will do just fine for me 
negative,the calibration on this is terrible can even use it it goes all over the place doesn go where im directing it to go make calls for work on my computer and it hung up when was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen it terrible 
positive,awesome
positive,tested this out after charging it so far so good 
neutral,worst keyboard ve ever owned by far am typing and right in the middle of every thing it freezes and takes minutes to catch up did not work at all for games do not waste your money on this trash 
negative,i finally pulled the plug and purchased this speaker and received april the sound was just ok it didn cover the whole house as would have loved the speaker when out october it didn even last year believe it was due to shortage in the port noticed earlier on that the flap to hide the power ports pushed up against the cord while plugged so my guess is that it finally got destroyed this is very disappointing given the fact that it is still fairly new now have to spend more money on new speaker the next time will go ahead and invest in the warranty 
positive,i like good sound
positive,got this for my father he loves it sounds damnnn good 
positive,my order came fast and on time use this little mouse at work all the time it is lightweight and slim enough to put in my scrub pocket for travel easy to clean only thing see is that cannot tell when the battery runs low keep an extra mouse handy for those times but other than that no complaints 
neutral,trash could not hear then completely stopped working
positive,really loved the led lights and the noise cancelling awesome
positive,clear sound and easy noise control 
neutral,i find the jbl charge to be exceptional in all respects and recommend it highly am somewhat baffled however by the wild jump in price surrounding my purchase bought it for it was not on sale three days later the price had jumped to don think the original price was mistake because that was the price for the product in all the different colors offered jump in price seems extraordinary is it worth in my opinion probably but that is for you to decide 
positive,i am thrilled with the speaker use it to play podcasts mostly when exercising sound is excellent for spoken text and does good job with commercial pop rock etc it is not suitable for most art music classical does not handle the wide dynamic range of this type of music nor the subtle timbres of instrumental ensembles 
positive,ordered this just before we went to the beach this thing rocks sounds amazing am blown away by how much power comes out of this little speaker and how clean it sounds even with the volume maxed out no regrets 
neutral,nice product 
positive,i bought this mouse for my work laptop the right click on the mouse is constantly getting stuck and the left click seems to take several pushes before it recognizes what it is supposed to do overall wouldn buy this again would definitely recommend spending allitle more and getting better mouse to get the job done 
positive,best headset we have had so far durable microphone works well they are comfortable 
neutral,not sure if the one got was just defective but the tracker did not seem to work very well as an analyst need something with smooth path and this mouse started stopped very abruptly had to return it 
neutral,they re just cheap quality and they re not really comfortable mic isn that good and they literally snap crackle and pop when you go to put them on your head 
neutral,slim and ergonomic mouse cool led lights while using it 
neutral,i use it flowering from home in my laptop l
neutral,good
neutral,i really liked this small mouse for my laptop it worked fairly well but the tracking wheel soon developed squeak that rendered it unusable 
positive,they are pretty good
positive,pro excellent backlighting lock keys indicators that are not usually seen on other wireless keyboards including logitech and microsoft the keyboard has great crisp positive feel there is no battery to replace it is perfectly sized for under desk trays con not sure if there is battery low indicator as the battery did run down too expensive 
positive,work very well and easy to set up you can charge it with your computer the best thing is no need for batteries
positive,this is the best bluetooth speaker have ever owned it charges my phone as listen to what seems endless hours of music great sound quality 
positive,nice size comfortable good battery life and plug in play 
positive,this is top quality and the sound is very good battery last long and charging other devices is easy
negative,i ordered it on june and at the end of august the dongle broke off of my usb there is still metal piece stuck in the usb 
positive,this product does what need it to do and does it perfectly super picky about stuff and can honestly say am very well pleased do believe have to turn it off for moment when it hibernates but that is whatever to me haha
neutral,the device looks and feels good the left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click the coloring is good looking but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge the short charging cord connects to the computer so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse which is inconvenient but the control of the curser is good although occasionally it seems to jump to different place on the screen still not sure why that happens but it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it quirks 
neutral,we were very excited to get this speaker we have the jbl boom box connect when we turned it on and played music there was static and the music would speed up we updated the app and tried several things but the static etc stayed it very disappointing 
positive,i have been using the wireless mouse for weeks waited to write the review so could truly review it based on my experience it has not disappointed me and like everything about it charge it whenever remember to the design is sleek and the changing colors are soothing when take my eyes off the screen stare at the mouse the respond to clicks is smooth and quick can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks 
neutral,can be little louder
neutral,good product for the money
positive,they show in pics like they are lit not with nintendo switch has separate port to plug in which required me to add cord with adapter super annoying would not have purchased 
neutral,quit working trashed it
positive,this is my third try at wireless backlit keyboard the first two were from different manufacturers the first two consistently duplicated and omitted many keystrokes finally found one that does what expected it to do the adjustable brightness backlight works fine and all keystrokes are accurate the key profiles are not as tall as other products in this category which is good for me wouldn think that should matter but found the taller keys on some of the others to be annoying like the somewhat minimal footprint for full feature keyboard as space on my desk is limited don use this for gaming but sometimes have to get up in the middle of the night for work call and the adjustable brightness backlit keyboard is welcome feature so don have to turn on the room lights for two minutes of computer work at am overall am very pleased 
neutral,work very slow
positive,amazing soubd
positive,this speaker has excellent sound quality the battery has great life we had it playing for party recently and it still showed life after hours it is great value for the price point
negative,mouse is comfortable to use silent clicks however failed after only months of use use every day for maybe couple of hours at time turned off when not in use and plugged in when necessary died about week ago after having for only months would not recharge will not use rechargeable mouse again would rather use rechargeable batteries 
positive,best bluetooth speaker on the market 
positive,works great out of the box shipping was fast dont really know what makes it gaming keyboard but it looks cool and feels nice on my fingers
positive,would love it if it held charge or had backup space for battery have to constantly charge this usually every two days in the middle of my work day im over it going to go back to battery mouse 
neutral,while typing high pitch humming comes from the charging port area that only goes away when the keyboard goes to sleep other than that the keyboard spacebar after long extensive typing starts to wear off and the spring becomes more audible 
positive,nice looking quiet works well 
negative,keys stop responding after few weeks contacted the manufacturer tried to fix but no luck received replacement and again within days keys don respond incredibly frustrating do not recommend this product 
negative,i have problems with this keyboard just deciding that am not pushing the buttons anymore even when leaving the keyboard connected directly to the computer at times it just stops responding and its incredibly frustrating when trying to game 
neutral,holds charge forever 
positive,sounds great even better in drywall corner have had it about two months and the deep ness of the sound is unparalleled 
positive,this speaker is quite bit larger heavier than expected but the sound is incredible well worth it 
positive,should have had usb charging port on it instead of micro usb otherwise it great for my daughter year old hands 
neutral,at first this mouse was the best ever however whenever it touches table the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up it was still very comfortable though however months later whenever turned it on it would start autoclicking and the only way to stop it is to remove the usb charger it great for the first months but then started failing me 
positive,noise cancellation is amazing 
positive,i got these for my boyfriend who plays video games on his pc and he absolutely loves these headphones they light up really cool blue when they are on very useful for noise cancellation and the quality of sound is amazing 
negative,the volume on this is lower than my flip big disappointment 
neutral,dropped this mouse once from desk to carpet and the scroll button broke guess you get what you pay for 
positive,i love my new mouse really like the low profile and the colorful lights it was totally plug and play with no problem very pleased with my purchase 
neutral,came fast no set up required just plug in and go the kids in my classroom love the light up feature 
positive,i love the speaker it great the sound is great upset didn order it sooner 
negative,very disappointed the mouse doesn hold charge even if you leave it on for short period of time while not using it you must recharge it would not buy again 
neutral,did not light up or do what it said
neutral,i surprised how highly rated this keyboard is given that the space bar isn quiet as advertised this isn manufacturing defect it the actual design besides that problem the enter key is whole key further away compared to most keyboards found myself repeatedly pressing where the key should be but that place is occupied by the backslash another problem is that in ubuntu the keyboard shortcut for create new folder doesn work on this keyboard 
neutral,battery dies quickly especially if you have the changing light mode on less than days of battery life with hr use 
negative, this keyboard is nice for the money the colors are very cool and the keys are really quiet however the space bar is audibly loud when pressed and find it distracting also they they have configured the return key different and put the back slash key before the return key which has made the stretch harder so every time try and hit the return key am hitting the forward slash key also very irritating normally that back slash key is above the return key have attached video and pictures of what am talking about am not sure if will keep it or not 
neutral,i would not recommend this mouse to anyone no right click available on the mouse does not work fell apart already it is very difficult to click the only plus is that it pretty color does not work very poor quality 
positive,this mouse does not work with my new mac air switched to my hp computer and it started to work periodically with it but now has stopped strongly recommend not purchasing this mouse to say the least it is unreliable

positive,excellent sound and portability and battery life highly recommended for portable sound quality
neutral,computer
positive,love the lights 
positive,i was so excited to receive this mouse chose it because the color with so nice bought it in mint green and the features of the multicolor led lights however to my surprise this mouse doesn hold charge after maybe two hours of use it done and needs to be charged for few hours in order to be used again naturally went back to my original apple mouse 
neutral,appearance size with built in charging 
neutral,loved the product look and that it was rechargeable however the battery didn hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use returning item and going back to logitech brand 
neutral,don waste your money
negative,i have had this mouse for less than months that and the rolling ball has stopped working that sucks 
neutral,worked for about week 
positive,i got these from my brother as christmas gift this past year and really like them don use them lot because my current computer doesn function well it also very cheap and old and sometimes the audio likes to pop because of that but other than that love them 
positive,this mouse is garbage buyer beware doesn hold charge doesn move the cursor bought for separate computers and its the same for both amazon basics mouse is better
positive,no complaints with this purchase slim design makes it easy to pack and go

positive,i admit the placement of the enter key is little weird but otherwise it great keyboard don use it for gaming it just my wireless keyboard use for remote work at home have long nails and consequently my typing can be really noisy so love how quiet the keys are on this keyboard after month battery life is really good so far and the colors are pretty

positive,this wireless mouse works great it light and connected right to my macbook air with no problem 
positive,it lightweight works great with really decent battery life don use the lights mode though which probably helps 
negative,i really wanted to love this mouse but it is terrible the scroll hardly works and yes tried multiple mousepads add to that the inability to click core functionality of computer mouse and the whole thing is piece of crappy light up plastic 
neutral,space bar and other keys were getting stuck and noisy 
positive,i ordered this mouse for part of my son birthday gift it arrived next day and he was very excited unfortunately he couldn click anything with it even though he could move the cursor around since he threw away the original box could not return the item so decided to contact the seller they have great customer service and she sent me the replacement right away this time the mouse works perfectly fine my son is so happy to have this cool looking mouse the price is amazing too

negative,i bought this for my home office usually had to change the mouse batteries once in months because always forget to turn off the mouse when am not using it now with this one don have to worry about all these things just recharge and use it 
positive,i ve been using logitech marble mice for years maybe over decade just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips but it weakness is that the marble mouse scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks legit scroll wheel that is probably the sole reason bought this led wireless mouse the led mouse seems to function well it has sleep mode that easily wakes up and had pretty color light around it don use it for general mousing but for scrolling once get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk in my lap wherever it makes up for what don have with my marble mouse the price was right and think if it what paid for it it good cheap addition 
neutral,it has endured for over year or so with no complaints or problems don cause from my end haven used the microphone due to laziness lack of need and computer issues so can review that part 
positive,i had to buy two different mice within months the scroll button stopped working on both devices other than that okay product led light function is cool sleek style and easily rechargeable 
negative,very disappointed with this keyboard do lot of office work and the ctrl shift doesn work on the left side of the keyboard did little research and it appears this is common issue you have to use ctrl shift on the right side which is so awkward will be returning this keyboard as am not happy with it on side note it is very quiet when type but the spacebar is much louder than the other keys

neutral,mouse is fine but my usb adapter was junk from the start be aware if you re planning on using it in one of these ports 
neutral,had to buy the adapter separately
positive,i initially liked this mouse because it cute it too flat to be ergonomic but that was okay except ve used it for less than month and the scroll wheel has fallen off its track it also dies very fast and needs to be recharged often don recommend it for anyone using mouse regularly 
positive,this is piece of garbage it uncomfortable with small ear muffs that make it pain to wear the sound quality is subpar and the mic is so quiet unable to be heard at all even tested with my old mic and the difference is night and day even checked my windows settings and the mic was all the way up was absolutely baffled because all of the reviews here make this seem like halfway decent product but can assure you buying this is the single best way to waste money this is hunk of garbage

positive,i purchased this mouse because needed new one for my work from home station came across this mouse and read some of the reviews and thought would take chance on it it has turned out to be one of the best things have purchased from amazon it is such smooth operating mouse and the color displays on it are really fun definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in search of wireless mouse

neutral,this item has already stopped working it was purchased in may
positive,my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my crafting love this color because it goes with my cricut also loved that it came with an adapter for my macbook air these newer macbooks require adapters for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is amazing don have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users 
positive,great product that is snap to setup and use plug it in and charge it and plug the receiver into your system and your good to go it fits my hand perfectly and is easy to use 
positive,i have had this keyboard for well over month now it is cordless and rechargeable the great thing about it is that when the battery needs charge can plug it in with the supplied usb cord and still use the keyboard while it is charging the keys are backlit with the light coming through each keys letter not just around them the lights turn off after short time of non use but light back up with the tap of any key would buy this again without hesitation if needed 
negative,for me personally just not good fit
positive,great mouse for the price nice and soft matte feel very quite clicks perfect for working in coffee shop works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces and connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software note rgb lights are not customizable but still cute as heck and works great

negative,decent little wireless mouse priced good for children who tend to lose and destroy things biggest issue is the charging cable that comes with it is garbage can be charged using phone charger all in all decent purchase and would buy again 
negative,this mouse was disappointing it would work for while and then it would lose connection and stop working thought at first it was losing traction and wasn sensing movement so bought an entirely new mousepad did the same thing after few minutes of use it would lose connection 
positive,i like very easy to install and the color change on the mouse
positive,i needed mouse for my laptop and so bought this the set up was really easy simply charge the mouse plug in the usb and done the silent clicks are indeed quiet but wouldn say they re completely inaudible but that totally okay with me when the mouse charges it turns blue and when it done charging the light will switch off when turn on the mouse to the color mode the colors fade nicely to the next the only nitpick for me is that wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don peek through it but it personal preference also like how it came with usb to usbc adapter just in case it needs to be used for mac overall great mouse 
positive,it is lot better than my other pair glad bought these

positive,i was used to buying name brand mouses and was worried about the size of this device but actually its good size just with lower profile works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top the lighting is nice not real bright but just strip around the outside and the button lights up changes color which is nice touch so actually like it better than the other larger mouses have

neutral,precise led optional lightweight mouse has slot for bluetooth and is rechargeable no more batteries stellar with the precision mouse pad
neutral,this mouse is cute and comfortable to use but the only downfall is if it is sitting idle for few minutes it hard to get it working again sometimes have to turn it off then on

positive,headphones clear sound working as intended microphone microphone performance is abysmal my friends could not understand me switched back to my last microphone to solve this issue verdict this headset if it did not have terrible microphone or did not have mic at all would be solid piece of equipment if you can find headset with better microphone quality grab that instead

neutral, less thank month later the part that goes into the computer has broken
positive,great speaker everything they claimed it to be

positive,i was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling the mouse stopped scrolling you don realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works for the scroll to just stop literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will decided to hold on to it cause it just so cute and matches my laptop however soon after the sensor and clicker stopped working as well now forced to get new mouse

positive,good for my wireless gaming setup needed ergonomic rests to use it though but it is good keyboard with good rgb lights but do wish sometimes that the lights stayed on hard to see the keys in my dark room sometimes when get ready to use it gotta click the wrong key to turn it back on to see which is right but other than that good response time battery life and all would recommend
neutral,i use only writing any way good 
positive,love this keyboard bought it to use with my ps and it works great the colors are great and like that it shuts itself off to conserve battery would definitely recommend 
positive,it comfortable it has mute and for you to control the volume
neutral,no battery life 
positive,works well enough sleep mode is not great it really goes to sleep and the charge does not hold for days but again well works well enough if you re looking for kinda cool mouse aesthetically this will work the gray is gorgeous 
positive,amazing sound quality the bass is awesome 
neutral,it worked very well till it didn anymore bought this in january and it won charge or do anything very disappointed
neutral,i bought this for my son for microphone to talk to his friends on ps the microphone does not work at all 
positive,i got the speaker and love it but won work with the jbl app so can get the bass up
neutral,didn hold charge long but now won recharge at all just threw it in the trash had battery operated mouse for years until lost it going back to batteries 
positive,this is the best mouse ve used in long time ve bought them for my kids and my friends and have back ups so when one is charging always have one
neutral,two stars because the ear cuffs are soft volume key doesn do much at all for the volume literally played audio through my projector because couldn get any games sound loud enough on the headset 
neutral,i bought this mouse thinking rechargeable was the way to do it worked well for about day tried to recharge it several times but would not hold any charge at all ve gone back to battery operated mouse 
neutral,this thing became erratic after about month ve tried all the fixes found online and nothing works 
neutral,i have mac book and have been charging the mouse for hours and it wouldn connect have tried everything and looked up how to set up the mouse but it didn work 
neutral,very good product
neutral,like other reviews stated this mouse is super nice smooth and looks neat but lasted just over the day return window put it on charge for the th time since had received it and the blue light comes on indicating it is charging and goes off some time later indicating it is complete when you switch it on the red light flashes and then goes off highly disappointing 
positive,this product does what need it to do and does it perfectly super picky about stuff and can honestly say am very well pleased do believe have to turn it off for moment when it hibernates but that is whatever to me haha
positive,i am old school when it comes to navigating the screen work much faster with wireless mouse everything about this mouse is great except you gotta to charge it mouse that require batteries work for very long time months in fact the charge on this mouse doesn last long have to remember to turn it off when not using it also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use starts acting sluggish as power runs down my old mouse is years old wanted cool new one to match my new laptop this one has soft smooth click the led lights are really fun however threw away the box before tried it out would send it back if had kept shipping material ll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging so much for progress i
positive,some stuff is okay to cheap out on but wouldn recommend it with this keyboard it worked just fine until it completely stopped holding charge after only months of use if you really want sweet light up key board bite the bullet and spend the money for legit one don waste your time or money 
positive,it is too small for average size hand the mouse literally disappear in your hand used it for minutes and it was very uncomfortable my fingers do not rest on the buttons they go over it but the design and functionality is good you will enjoy using this mouse if you have small hands 
positive,this keyboard is very good for its price works well battery has decent duration type hours per day and it lasts around days with one charge 
negative,terrible product does not work well glitches causes cursor to makes sudden unintended changes in direction without in use would not recommend
neutral,they quit working week after got them 
positive,the headphone cord seems little long but other then that they get the job done would definitely recommend 
neutral,i chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories however the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable it extremely light weight however feel it is going to break easily since the plastic is so thin so far for gaming ve had no issues with performance of the mouse itself 
positive,really great little mouse good clicking and control the battery lasts me days at work between charges get this mouse 
positive,i works great it fits really good on my head the sound is really good too 
positive,i got this for my mother and she loves it 
neutral,mouse works well and holds charge for several hour work days only drawback for me is that the scroll wheel is loud 
positive,i just opened this item and already love it sound quality is amazing loud and clear and it connected to my phone right away it arrived on time and was nicely packaged 
positive,jbl is beautifully designed sounds just perfect the only problem is if you give it to your daughter for her eighteenth birthday days later she may irresponsibley drive around town with it in her car and leave it at her friend house for weeks then one of her friends will likely steal it because it is such fantastic little speaker just take that into consideration before purchasing 
positive,this item is very good haven used it enough to determine the capacity of the battery but happy with it so far 
neutral,pretty but dies quick even with new batteries we returned it
neutral,sound is good mic is decent the button on it however does not mute when muted
negative,not worth it had this for only months and it broke it just stopped working could not scroll at all no matter what did not worth the money then after contacting amazon was charged dollar restocking fee for them and had to send it back on my own 
neutral,came quickly easy to set up delivery person put in spot close to door and knocked to let me know it was there door bell not working and he was wearing his mask
neutral,i liked this mouse just fine bought it to use at school with my chromebook it was fine until couple weeks ago scrolled the mouse wheel and something broke now the wheel just spins and spins and does nothing only used it few times week for meetings and such would buy better one don bother with this one 
positive,very loud and has fun features 
positive,unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun used it for work as fedex express courier not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls arm rests cruise control or insulation from the elements we don have speakers imagine hours on the road in loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress so one night decided no more of that this speaker fit right into the passengers seat and would strap the seatbelt just incase the trucks had world class terrible suspension the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying with that at full volume in the truck that battery might last around or hours but man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body everything it made my driving experience so much better that being said would only need full volume on the highway did you know express trucks are governed to mph well assuming our trucks could even easily reach that at least in my station they all had check engine lights and once timed that it took seconds to go from mph to mph fun and when was driving from mph having the speaker at was fine at that rate could make it last about hours before needing recharge thank jbl for creating such great speaker and frankly am sure their other products have that battery capacity needed but got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack for the situation was in it was total game changer went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs on the off chance another courier reads this making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind luckily do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use but when needed it my life was much better for it it sat next to an open door in an isuzu reach and never moved centimeter providing me with amazing sound all the while know now anything and everything might throw at it will never take it down if battery life is your concern it is valid if you want the best sound for the size of the speaker this is hard to beat and it has my doing deliveries in tin can with an open door on road at mph still sounding good seal of approval 
neutral,purchased these as quick fix for broken pair of quality headphones while my new ones arrived used for gaming only very big and bulky below average sound quality appreciate the lengthy wire they re ok 
positive,headset was comfortable and great sound quality for and excellent price 
positive,the sound quality is very clear and perfect for gaming on the ps mic is clear very happy with these 
positive,the sound is awesome very nice speaker for it size 
positive,i am very happy with this mouse the colors are interesting and the fact that don have to buy batteries is an added plus 
negative,update after about weeks of use it just completely stopped working ve been using it plugged into the computer via the charger because the wireless connection is so inconsistent but today when got home from work it just not working didn get it wet didn drop it etc can think of any reason for it to just randomly stop working but it did wireless or plugged in the keyboard still lights up with the rainbow color but doesn acknowledge any key strokes caps and num lock don light up and my computer just keeps saying device not responding when try to manually connect it don throw your money away buy functional keyboard from reputable brand not some shoddy chinese company with positive review bots original this keyboard has some sort of timer so it will turn off when it not used it about seconds when it plugged in it comes with ridiculously short usb cable maybe feet long and seconds or so when being used wirelessly when it automatically turns off it takes anywhere from seconds to turn back on and reconnect to bluetooth before it starts registering keystrokes again it constant annoyance that makes most games frustratingly unplayable and can figure out any way to disable it really can recommend this to anybody it truly makes games unplayable and any other computer activity annoying and frustrating with lot of wasted time waiting for it to reconnect gonna have to return this garbage and get new wireless keyboard 
positive,great speaker cost waterproof battery audio great speaker 
positive,my son loves this headset it was his favorite birthday gift he uses it everyday to communicate with other online gamers this has been his only source of socializing with other kids since the pandemic started it quality headset for great price he has destroyed all other headsets but this one very satisfied with this purchase just know that it only lights up when playing on pc not xbox or playstation my son doesn care though 
positive,this keyboard is satisfying purchase it checks all the right boxes and is great for gaming work and everyrthing in between 
positive,worked great for week until the first charge ran out plugged it in and wouldn charge we attempted different cable different port different outlet nothing worked junk returning and buying different brand 
neutral,not sure yet if the price justifies the product 
neutral,but the item jul months didnt chrage it more than times yet the charger broke its nice but wont last
positive,i like how it looks and you can hear well 
positive,awesome product was carefully retrieved from our inventory with sterilized anti bacterial gloves and placed on satin silk cushion team of experts then proceeded to inspect your product they polished it until it shone bright and bid it farewell with tender caress then delivered quickly using two euro fighter to escort and insure its safe arrival upon inspection understood why klim took so much care and pride to provide this kool gaming keyboard have enjoyed using it right out of the box without any problems klim offered me email support to answer any question about using their product my only question is how did they managed to evade our fs thanks paultip the klim chroma wireless has light modes breathing constant and off you can change it by pressing fn pause break you can also increase the luminosity by pressing fn page up and decrease it with fn page down 
neutral,disappointed that can connect with phone calls otherwise great
neutral,i don like the sleep mode if that what it is that makes me have to press the button every time want to use it again rather it just stay on also it has to be recharged every days and not big computer user so that pain because have to change the cord and usb every time 
neutral,i like the back lit keys but the keyboard has really short battery life we have to charge it few times week and we do not use it all day 
neutral,bought for work
positive,my son loves his headset he has no complaints and uses it pretty much daily 
negative,microphone is bad build quality is horrible feels very cheap like you could purchase at below 
positive,this mouse is great it feels good in your handle glides well easy to use and looks amazing while doing it it makes work little less boring and looks so sleek on my desk 
positive,best mouse ve ever bought 
positive,this is the second set of this brand of headphones ve used and just as satisfied as was the first time it has everything shown in the picture and splitter from the headphone jack to microphione and headphone jack the usb port gives it the lights the audio quality is pretty good if not bit bass but with some adjusting it pretty good for music it has good somewhat heavy feel to it and the foam is firm but not uncomfortable 
neutral, 
neutral,for gaming not bad
positive,love that speaker last me whole day at work plus can charge my phone when needed 
positive,i love it drounds out my neighbors yelling at me
positive,great mouse nothing super fancy comfortable to use the lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life holds charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary plugged in to different computers and worked immediately on both seems quite reaponsive but only use it for general computer work so dont know how it would work for gaming all in all great mouse for decent price will update if anything changes
negative,this keyboard is decent it types well has good tactile response and an easy to adjust to layout in addition the rgb backlight works great and looks good minor flaw the flip out legs to prop the keyboard to more ergonomic position tend to close easily from the pressure of typing or gaming minor flaw if you type all day and game all night this is not the keyboard for you since the battery life when subjected to all day activity is relatively short have to charge the keyboard literally five times as often as my wireless mouse of different brand major flaw given that battery life is not where would like it to be the biggest problem with this keyboard is that there is absolutely no warning that the battery on the keyboard is low you are typing or gaming and the keyboard suddenly becomes non responsive because the battery is suddenly dead of course quickly resolved by plugging in the charging cord but incredibly annoying and inconvenient overall decent keyboard but not having any type of warning that the battery is almost dead is really annoying since having to stop and plug it in often causes the loss of train of thought when working or the death of my avatar when gaming pretty lights though 
negative,unacceptable days after purchase trackwheel stopped working everything else works except that so frustrating to not have that for easy access 
positive,the mouse falls asleep right away the cord for recharging is only about in in long constantly needs to be recharged it is definitely not five star product it looks cool 
positive,tiny great for laptop size 
positive,it been few months and still works well very nice purchase thank you 
neutral,it broke from one say to the next sad cause it was cute and very handy but the product just didn last long at all 
neutral,although haven tested its water resistance cause im paranoid 
neutral,i got this for my laptop and it does not work very well it skips or just does not move at all gave it to my grandson thinking that since it says it for gaming that maybe it would work better for him but he does not like it at all he says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected 
positive,jbl flip is sufficient although loved the green this one size bigger didn have any otheradvantages over the flip other than the color kept the flip sent this one back 
positive,this is our rd one they all connect together great sound and easy to use 
neutral,i ve enjoyed this mouse for the most part it everything it mentions in the description however my scroll wheel just randomly broke after only month of using purchased the mouse for work purposes and the scroll literally broke during project 
positive,i have had this mouse for while now love it it perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part don have to recharge it everyday but really only use it for work so work an hour day again it really doesn need to be charged often when it time for charge the color will start to shift to red everyone that seen it has asked where got it and that they want one 
positive,sound is great it has good sound force size is perfect very lightweight the color red is really nice color 
neutral,this mouse is clunky as it would at times not connect however ordered it in march and now in april the mouse no longer works do lot but 
neutral,very good for gaming on my pc 
positive,gift for family the love it pool party camping and outdoor fun they love the fact that they can charge their mobile devices from the speakers
positive,i love theme for everything
negative,died within the first month of use nice mouse wanted to use it instead of the trackpad on the laptop too bad it didn work for long 
neutral,just received this yesterday and plugged it in today have left it on the charger for longer than hours because every time it says it is charged can not use it longer than min before it goes dead like the look and feel of it but did not buy it to used plugged in very disappointed and will have to buy something different the box got thrown away so guess it can not be returned at this point will give it one more day to try before choosing something different like to hope that just got lemon 
neutral,this item was returned the one time it worked it was awsome 
neutral,i can get through the morning without this mouse losing its charge would rather battery 
positive,it is comfortable to use the changing colors add visual interest
negative,title says it all one of the shift keys and the caps lock stopped working after only months don bother 
neutral,now correct me if wrong but keyboard is meant to be used to type hooked this up to my rig and when try to type anything literally nothing happens then like secs later the first letter of what tried to type pops up then nothing happens if the description of this keyboard would ve said light up keyboard for display use only then out of stars since it is advertised as useful keyboard and gaming keyboard at that have to say don buy it buy literally anything else and maybe even letters might get typed 
positive,very easy to set up and use love it
positive,idk if would say this is great mouse for gaming but it great for the price and very smooth different setting are great too flip the lights on and it like rave in your hand 
neutral,the coolest mouse ever it charges quickly and lasts long time love the color changes and the smoothness it scrolls with 
neutral,so many uses 
negative,after couple months my mouse died don buy this thing 
positive,very cool keyboard it easy to the eye at night when using would recommend this item to friends family and anyone else interested 
neutral,stop working one after purchased no help from amazon to replace 
neutral,it states that it has usbc converter but it does not work
positive,super good 
negative,unboxed this today and couldn listen for more than an hour muted sound no treble just overloaded with bass removing the extra bass with the bluetooth volume reduction buttons combo to produce flat sound didn help jbl hk should invest in an eq app asap to allow users increase the higher frequencies to produce their preferred output balance can even live with just preset eq settings but not this jbl didn listen to all the charge criticisms about sound quality very disappointing packaging back up to return total waste of time
neutral,the keyboard stopped recharging after using up the battery twice 
negative,broke after no more than minutes of use something on the inside disconnected and the scrawling wheel spins freely not only it was waste of money actually needed compact mouse for my portable office forgot all about it in my trip now it is too late to return it you get what you pay for 
positive,the mouse performs just like it states perfect design smooth scrolling and quality product 
positive,we both of these and truly loved them both great sound quality long battery life and perfect portable size too 
neutral,can see the letters on the keys lights don add any benefit return key is farther away than on most keyboards so end up hitting the key instead very bad choice on my part 
positive,my niece brought this unit to my house for camp out and was so impressed with it that bought one the next day 
neutral,i have purchased two of this product in the past year one to replace the other on both of the the scroll button stopped working dropped the first one and understood why it stopped working the second one did not drop it just quit working after months cute and light weight but not long lasting enough for me 
neutral,the volume is as high as the jbl flip it looks bigger but it not as high it was huge disappointment what the point of it being bulky if the sound is not high stick to the flip cheaper and sounds exactly the same 
positive,has good sound but tuned more on bass side boom boom it makes hard to listen to minute details in musicit would be great if jbl provides equalizer feature in app so user can customize bass treble according to their own preference 
positive,considering it keyboard and the title indicates long lasting rechargeable battery you expect the charge to last little longer the fancy glow lights obviously drain it faster than you expect it gives you no warning when the charge is low just quits and you have to plug it in otherwise it is keyboard the lights are cool bought this for the cordless factor after it charged but it the star feeling not bad not great it fine 
neutral,do yourself favor and don waste your money this cheap flimsy mouse that only works for couple of weeks 
positive,loved this keyboard but after months certain keys just stopped working wish could return 
neutral,good mouse very smooth
neutral,heart my ears and lower quality
positive,it honestly awful it won charge and ve tried four different chargers 
neutral,while working with macbook pro frequently mouse is getting disconnected need to take the dongle out and then attach for reconnection wouldn recommend if you are using type port 
negative,after receiving this mouse charged the mouse per the instructions on normal rate usb charger non fast charger this took little under two hours for full charge the blue light goes out when fully charged installed the usb receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on windows the mouse seems to work smoothly and the mouse pointer is swift you can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast the mouse lights up around the sides when in use it is bit quirky but it doesn bother me also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for certain period of time probably to prolong the battery charge to wake the mouse just move it or press button overall it is decent wireless rechargeable mouse 
neutral,like the mouse but having to recharge it with usb all the time is annoying and unproductive 
neutral,good for the price
neutral,not well made very light and flimsy returned it 
positive,awesome good quality and fast delivery 
positive,dope brought it for my girl and she loves it its super clear and loud not much bass but what do expect for the size and price point id recommend it great for pool and beach days
neutral,the top is not opaque like the photos it translucent there is only one lighting mode there is no rainbow effect on the edge like the photo 
positive,sound quality is very good bass is pretty good over all love this speaker
positive,these are the best headphones ve ever purchased the sound quality is smooth and amazing and any noise that is around you is completely cancelled out couldn be happier with this product and highly recommend it 
neutral,really good sound quality
positive,much louder than other models with solid base sound can easily be heard through walls thanks son 
neutral,usb part broke inside of computer hardly used 
neutral,had to throw it away because the metal part that goes into the computer came out
positive, goes perfect with my set up 
negative,lights don work unless the usb is connect and have no play to connect it and horrible customer service
positive,love the led lights connects quickly the rechargeable feature is great until you forget to recharge
positive,i use this all day during work and then use it to play the sims the evening or on the weekend it charges quickly and the battery lasts so long love that the mouse automatically goes into sleep mode because often forget to turn it off the matte finish is sleek and comfortable have no complaints
positive,great headset for cheap price 
positive,i have been using the wireless mouse for weeks waited to write the review so could truly review it based on my experience it has not disappointed me and like everything about it charge it whenever remember to the design is sleek and the changing colors are soothing when take my eyes off the screen stare at the mouse the respond to clicks is smooth and quick can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks 
positive,i love this headset because it is awesome for gaming and cancels out annoying noise 
negative,i bought of this product for myself and my family all stopped scrolling just like that when my first one went bad borrowed my daughter and that stopped scrolling so did the other and we only had them for little over month when they stopped working there appears to be major defect in this product 
positive,this mouse is very sleek and comfortable to use the click is very quiet highly recommend for the price 
neutral,great at first then after month it stopped working it like the battery was weak and it was slow to respond to movement and felt sticky do not recommend 
negative,i ve only used this product once and it stopped working after only using it for an hour and half after being fully charged it says just two hours of charging can last days but obviously that lie the usb receiver also arrived broken don waste your money on this 
negative,these worked for exactly days then died no wonder they were marked down so much these were purchased for use with an ipad which it says they are compatible very disappointing considering the amount of positive reviews 
neutral,i ve learned this lesson again open the package and use the product right away ordered this mouse in august as my travel mouse and just packed it away in my bag now ve been visiting family in the pnw since mid september the mouse took charge and worked fine for couple of weeks after recharged the mouse it worked for day or two and then ceased to function the optical light will flash once when turned on then nothing of course the return window is well past 
positive,kicks ass booming bass best ve ever had as portable water resistant outdoor speaker works great indoors too volume gets loud and not seemingly throttled like other speakers at small distanced campfire among pod sharers we linked speakers and it was incredible the nd and rd speaker occasionally cut for second but came back on in sync too believe it was in relation to distance or blockages from phone to speaker rather than speaker to speaker in other words speakers around the phone can make larger circle opposed to repeating to go one further from the master speaker in line recommend getting case to extend the life of this awesome addition enjoy 
positive,i love this speaker this is like my th one have them all around the house can connect all of them togeather wirelessly and fill the whole house with great sounding musc 
neutral,i bought this mouse to go with my work laptop when have to travel to sites hate using the pad that is built into the laptop this is cute and little am thinking about using it for my personal laptop when gaming or doing school work 
negative, works well until it goes into sleep mode when you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around the only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on which seems minuscule but it gets really annoy the longer you use it maybe just got defective one it got some really high marks but buyer beware video shows it being woken up then turn it off on and it works fine 
positive,i bought this mouse in april liked it lot for months for the last few weeks it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about half hour even if try to use it plugged into the computer it stops tracking and the lights dim can find any warranty information on it feel like it should have lasted more than months think ll buy wireless mouse with known brand name and hope for better luck 
neutral,not fan have had better for cheaper 
positive,good sound good mic quality and its comfortable 
positive,great speaker as always from jbl have bought jbl speakers this year alone and can get enough of them this speaker is perfect for any occasion great sound that fills up the room ve had other more expensive bluetooth speakers and jbl always blows them out of the water 
neutral,it works
positive,purchased for home use it wonderful to not have wires everywhere 
positive,sound is pretty good for the price
positive,my son loves his new headphones works very well with his ps
positive,i was really excited about this mouse it arrived and worked perfectly for about week and now it refuses to respond have tried charging it it currently plugged into my computer as the instructions specify but it dead to the world have tried all of troubleshooting suggestions but you can troubleshoot something that won turn on for love or money so for one week was happy now just irritated and disappointed don bother spending the money no matter how awesome it seems you ll just be let down 
positive,this thing was worth every penny cannot believe the sound that comes from this tiny speaker very impressed 
neutral,nice headset didn realize the led lights don come on once plugged into controller from my experience it has to be plugged in to an usb outlet
neutral,portability 
neutral,it stopped working after weeks
negative,this products microphone almost immediately broke like day of out of the box kind of fast its kind of ridiculous that payed this much and then got normal headphones with no microphone
neutral,or should say worked well it stopped working after like weeks 
positive,i use this for gaming and im in love with the product
positive,i originally ordered this keyboard just over years ago and was and still am very happy with the product the product is lightweight the keys feel nice and they are pretty quiet like that it has the separate number pad but the whole keyboard is not too large or bulky the rechargeable battery lasted longer than expected so was able to take advantage of the wireless feature when the battery does die you can still use the keyboard while it is plugged in and charging and the battery light on the top right corner turns off when its charged the rainbow colour lights behind the keys are nice touch too am not gamer though so have no comment on its features for that purpose just recently the battery started to die more frequently and had to plug it in more often which was not the end of the world for me as most keyboards require cords anyway however the battery eventually started to expand and the keyboard warped and became unusable went back to my amazon order and checked to see if there was warranty and there was years reached out to customer service via email with pictures of the keyboard and my original invoice they responded within the same day and offered me replacement have the replacement now and still love it the company has provided exceptional customer service they were very responsive and they stand behind their product they even checked in with me to make sure that received the replacement and that it was working as expected 
neutral,incredibly loud connects quickly
positive,i bought these because have radio show and have to do my show from home they pick up my voice pretty well and the sound is really good 
positive,mouse arrived the next day easy to set up and use have had no problems at all it works as it should 
positive,this speaker has been nice upgrade from the standard dollar speaker you can get anywhere the sound is rich and it does have good bass can why others stated some of the voice gets drowned out at times but enough to deter me from not buying this speaker overall the sound is great and can get decently loud the color got was sand and it looks great one thing that does not make sense to me is they dont give power cord dont recall the last time ve spent this much on an electronic that didnt come with accessory that is as important as that all in all like it and very pleased with my purchase 
positive,good price cool lights conveniently comes with usb to usb adapter 
neutral,worked when first charged it once the charge ran down it wouldn charge again 
positive,i use this mouse for my laptop love that it super smooth and very quick 
positive,i like the weight of the board and the key action only wish you could change the lighting
positive,i got this because it was cute and needed soft keys or my girlfriend was going to lose her mind when we work from home together it soft quiet cute and easy function love it does die faster than would like but it lights up of course it does 
positive,great sound comfortable adjustable fit my son uses this for online school as well as gaming fun would recommend this product to others 
positive,just received these headphones days back and so far my son just loves them great gaming headphones and have long wire to be able to plug into different devices
positive,sounds great looks great 
neutral,it turns off when using it sometimes
neutral,the overall quality of the sound was really good and can hear all my games properly through it 
positive,love this speaker great quality sound and battery life worth every penny my only small complaint is wish there was some type of hook to secure it when on the river 
positive,i don use it for gaming that why give it three stars for that haven used sleep mode and don plan on it so gave it three stars not using that either the three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be little bit taller and we both have tiny hands will be small for someone with large hands for sure the colors are nice price is right oh and we like how it changes colors would buy again adapter that comes with are very convenient and worth the money paid just for the adapters 
neutral,i had the mouse charging all weekend when returned to work monday morning smelled something hot but no one else smelled anything went to unplug my mouse and my cord was so hot couldn even touch it the entire cord melted and the wires had burned through the rubber coating very easily could have caught my computer on fire do not buy this mouse unless you have great fire insurance 
neutral,tried to take this to and from work and the wheel in the center is no longer functional
neutral,these headphones have really good sound quality especially for the price 
negative,i bought of this product for myself and my family all stopped scrolling just like that when my first one went bad borrowed my daughter and that stopped scrolling so did the other and we only had them for little over month when they stopped working there appears to be major defect in this product 
neutral,speakers have trouble connecting to bluetooth tried resetting and still get distorted sound when connecting to stereo mode thru the jbl app the sound is good and am sure the battery life is fantastic possible got bad set box appeared to have been previously opened sending back and getting replacement 
neutral,poor package 
positive,practically all bluetooth speakers are mono it has nothing to do with how many drivers speakers cones it has to get stereo sound you usually need to have two of the same or typically at least the same brand bluetooth speaker and send different audio right or left to each one the charge had two forward facing mid high range drivers driven by same signal so they effectively acted as one driver speaker charge replaced the two forward facing drivers with single larger higher quality forward facing driver that produces better depth and definition at least in my opinion ll take the charge over the charge or the flip any day 
neutral,it beautiful but it literally stopped working after month it charges but when turn it on it shuts down right away 
positive,i love the comfort of the headset at first was little uncomfortable due to the fact never had headsets this large before but the comfort and the quality of the set adjust my way of thinking about the sets brought them for gaming and video calls the quality is great from the voice end to the listening side the mute is not difficult and easy to plug in and use 
positive,amazing my father loved it for the poolside easy to connect and has long range so it doesn cut out when people the music player walks inside with their phone to use the bathroom ten out of ten 
positive,great for the price hold charge for good amount of time
neutral,great product but bring charger the battery only really lasts for or so hours
positive,update may the speaker started crackling and became unusable fortunately it was still under warranty and jbl was very responsive in handling the return and repair just hope it lasts this is my second jbl bluetooth speaker also have the charge which am very happy with however after years the battery no longer holds charge the charge has excellent sound quality at the high mid and low ranges bought both the charge and ue megaboom for comparison purposes no contest jbl was the superior speaker for sound in my opinion the ue speaker wins for features as it comes with great app that allows for more customized sound and user experience sound quality is what care about most so kept the jbl and returned the ue 
positive,i love the product but love the customer service even more had an issue with the usb clearly my fault and lolita and her customer service team was truly amazing helping me to resolve the issue the are all truly amazing even sent me candy after few weeks of putting up with me and assisting me with my wireless light up keyboard 
neutral,this worked great for months then one day just stopped working 
neutral,there is so much unnecessary wiring really excessive amount of weight for mic on off and volume false picture advertisement no blue light are in not worth the money 
neutral,the usb dongle broke for the mouse and is now completely useless wish the seller sold replacements so can use my mouse again 
negative,jbl uses non standard charging port if you misplace your cord none of the hundreds of other charging cords you have laying around will work knew about this and no surprise still managed to misplace it my tone is polite but actually seething about this tired old engineered money grab tactic thousands on thousands of other manufacturers chose standard readily available port and cord to hell with you for not doing the same at this stage in the game it just good sense and basic common courtesy 
positive,sound is very good for single speaker with excellent bass response an adjustable eq vis phone app would be nice but still sounds great where this thing shines is battery life ve had it for few months and am still working on the first chafe and use this speaker daily 
positive,didn make it month son was so excited to get em loved em for the half month they worked reached out to them to see if there is any warranty on them waiting for reply 
negative,lights were nice but one of the keys was broken
neutral,it an ultra slim design power saving and easy to use ergonomic design high precision and silent click

neutral,rechargeable
neutral,you get what you get for its price
neutral,charging indicator light stopped working after only few days so could never tell if its actually charging or not wasn huge deal because at least it still worked but now that it been like months went to plug it in the other night charged it all night and it now wont even hold charge can plug it in for hours turn it on and the lights only stay on for few seconds before the whole unit dies totally not happy that now have to spend another that don have on another keyboard like the saying goes buy it nice or buy it twice 
neutral,i started using this keyboard and it was perfect until hit the spacebar the spacebar makes rattling noise when you even touch it at all you don even have to press it down it unavoidable to make this sound no matter how gingerly you press the key unless this was single unit problem this design is garbage as silent keyboard 
positive,love this speaker the sound is amazing the battery life is great plus you can use it as power bank to charge your usb devices as for portability it would be best to buy the protective case with clips would buy again and again
positive,i followed instructions for charging and tried few different methods but could never get this to power on or work the company was great to quickly refund it though 
neutral,incredible quality
positive,i bought this headset as the third replacement for my year old who tends to be tough on electronics he loves the fact that it lights up and it drowns out noise he says that it comfortable and sounds great he has only had it short time but it is still holding up pretty well we will see how great the durability is in time 
positive, its really great don use it for gaming if you are looking for that review stop here but for other review keeping reading it changes color on its own you can personally change it that bummer it slowly changes color one thing that bothers me is the default red light when you move it the red light appears and it over powers the other changing colors if your fine with the red light then buy it other than that it does its job really pretty too the mouse is matte black so its not shiny just wanted to mention that 
positive,love my headphones for ps very good in anything play
neutral,it be sounding nice and shi
positive, this was pretty good buy and it actually better than thought it pretty quiet when typing and very smooth love how it goes to sleep mode after few seconds the lights on the keyboard are nice and vibrant much better than thought it would be comes with usb to cord for lightning fast charging only charged it once on friday and it still going we ll see how long the keyboard power will last will definitely keep you guys posted other than that no complaints so far

positive,works great in laptop very aesthetically pleasing ready to use and install
negative,nothing but issues the scroll wheel broke for no reason at all no longer holds charge would not recommend 
positive,excellent battery life and sound very happy with this purchase 
positive,the sound quality is amazing you only hear the gameplay and it can light up 
positive,i wanted wireless mouse and this one fit my needs it is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power it can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary the colors are great touch and use them depending on the mood in at the time also like being able to choose the resolution on the fly with the button on the top have already recommended it to couple of friends 
positive,i purchased this mouse for my thinkpad running linux and it worked like charm set up was breeze simply plugged it in and it worked it even works when in the settings this mouse is hard to beat for the price 
positive,still can believe how good this product is for the price ve been using this headset for the past couple of months and it is solid 
neutral, it cute and light weight but one drop and it done for literally dropped it once and it now doesn work 
positive,my year old daughter loves this addition to her gaming desktop 
neutral,sound quality is good
neutral,the first mouse lasted months and bought the same mouse to replace it it died within day of using it buy cheap get cheap not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for refund the first one worked great and had satisfying button click shame it didn last very long 
neutral,sounds break up it not loud says xbox one compatible but it not cheap quality 
neutral,these really helped my son
neutral,so just got these today and was excited however upon setting them up noticed that the light up function is only usable when hooking up the attached usb to the port on my ps stupidly enough there isn enough cable split to also connect the headphones to your controller in order to use the headphones for its sole purpose it either they light up on the damn counter and look cute or you talk to friends while playing online but there is no both so can you say complete design flaw false advertisement and bottom line this company needs to close shop and go flip burgers 
negative,ive tried everything under the sun to make it work and alas it will not lol don buy it not worth it
positive,bought as gift for someone and they absolutely loved it she said they work better then the ones she paid over for
positive,it size is perfect for both travel and for my hands the led is great feature and works just as well as the wired one for my pc even bought my mother one and she loves it too

neutral,i ve used this product before and had no complaints this time purchased it charged it and the next day tried to use it and it wasn turning on at all tried to charge it again and the same result returned immediately 
negative,i originally gave this product only stars due to difficult bluetooth connection with my laptop there learning curve figured out how to change settings and am now using it regularly like it use it in the backyard in remote area without cell service or internet end of changed review my music collection is largely on my hp laptop itunes does not interface with bluestacks so can use the speaker for all my music jbl connect uses new bluetooth that requires location access bought the charge to use on wooded property that build mountain bike trails upon there is no cell service in the woods can interface with itunes can use this product without internet if want to use jbl connect with the new ble which was not familiar with prior to purchasing this is clearly an urban android related cell service or internet service reliant device it worthless to me because of my unique desire to go use it outdoors without these services imagine it great for streaming services but extremely disappointed with its limitations other people have left very bad reviews for the jbl connect app nice idea that will probably work well with your cell phone in an urban setting but then ve plenty of other options when not outdoors the product is both under thought and over thought and find myself in the middle with very limited functionality 
positive,it nice sleek mouse and works relatively well until it stops charging had bought it early march this year and now early may it won charge making it hunk of useless plastic buy with the expectation you will have to buy again and not very long thereafter 
positive,excellent quality nice presentation size very portable

positive,it serves the purpose of playing loud clear sounding music
neutral,i was concerned that this would be difficult to setup but was shocked on how easy it was to connect 
negative,i was very disappointed in this mouse had hard time clicking it and thought maybe just had to get used to it by day wanted to throw it away bought new one and kept it for students to use if they need it they hate it too 
negative,disappointed in this mouse the wheel broke after months 
neutral,i only used it for week and the scroller stopped working
neutral,i would buy it against it pretty not really bling just sleek 
negative,usb got stuck and broke inside my computer
neutral,stopped working less than year after purchase the lights come on then immediately turn off after turning the keyboard on and they keys won work reseated the receiver and moved to different ports with no success charging doesn work 
neutral,it had worked very well for me for about years and it very aesthetic 
positive,it comfortable and noise cancelling the sound quality is pretty good 
positive,i just needed wireless mouse for at work because was sick of the cord the company issued mouse had the color is bright and the lights are nice subtle change to working they re pretty the only thing hate is that have to bounce it on the mousepad to wake it up nothing major but the sensor could be better it not overwhelmingly wonderful but it cute and is good value considering the cost 
neutral,the rest of the mouse is fine but the scroll wheel no longer scrolls took just over month for it to break so can even return it now 
neutral,the laser is broken it jumps everywhere on the screen 
positive,love it
neutral,ergonomic and nice
positive,looks great feels great unfortunately doesn completely work while some keyboard shortcuts work many are missing the biggest omission for me was ctrl who doesn use the save shortcut literally use it every few minutes as working checked the reviews before purchasing and chalked it up to user error but nope you literally can use the save shortcut that dealbreaker for me do not recommend this keyboard if efficiency is your thing 
neutral,coming from the logitech series headphones the bengoo headphones are more than adequate for gaming loud and crisp comfy only down side is the mic portion is not bendy like the mic closer to my face 
neutral,love for the most part charges fast but runs out fast hard to see the pointer arrow have closed lots of things by accidentrn
neutral,stopped working in less than week just up and died and now it has to be returned and look for another one save yourself the effort and keep on lookin this ain it

positive,great item
positive,not as loud as wanted it to be great for room
positive,great product
neutral,does not hold charge for more than week half the time you hit key it doesn register should not have gone with the cheaper model 
positive,i had bluetooth speaker for years and it finally died so needed to find replacement after careful research and debate decided on this model it looks slightly small but it packs punch used it the first weekend after arrival at campsite the site was booming with music and was astonished at the quality the speaker also lasted full days of almost constant use definitely my new camping speaker added bonus is you can charge phones via the speaker overall love the quality of this device my only gripe is it could be little bassier 
neutral,this mouse is just trash it lifespan is days stopped working just days after the return window closed don recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting getting tired of amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse 
positive,works great
positive,the best headset it is really good 
positive,the sound quality is amazing
negative,they worked really well but broke after month the wires came apart
negative,i am not great typist this keyboard has terrible problem keeping up with the typist have used it several times for word processing and spreadsheet applications on my pc because look at the keyboard when type find out after minute or so of typing look up and find over third of what typed is full of missed letters entire words are missing parts of words are run together the keyboard just doesn register all of my keystrokes have even tried slowing down and being even more deliberate about my touches on the keystrokes same result sending this back for sure

neutral,very satisfied with this mouse 
positive,love my led light up mouse it very quiet and no more clicking noise yay thanks amazon
neutral,it disconnects at times requiring you to unplug the usb connection and reconnect 
positive,i liked the brand and the color of this particular item expected better sound quality from this brand since listen to their large monitor speakers home 
neutral,was nice mouse while it lasted it is not even months old and not working turns on but then nothing 
positive,the sound is good it just the mic when talk my friends say they can hear me good
neutral,it keeps shaking 
positive,we use it in our rv great sound 
neutral,so have had this mouse for about weeks and it works perfectly never encountered the problems people had with it stopping and people say that the battery dies too quickly which have been using on the same battery without charging it for days my cursor has also never messed up it works just fine the only problem have with this device is the lighting is not nearly as impressive as thought it would be but guess that what you get for buying mouse for 
positive,this mouse has been the best one that have ever used would purchase this again the fun part of the multi colors is another reason to purchase it again
neutral,hear clearly
neutral,i love how this mouse looked and it didn hurt my hands unfortunately was able to only charge it and now it won recharge at all 
positive,ok admit it love the colors necessary nope super fun yup just adds little playfulness to my office desk works great comes with charging cord charge lasts long time love it 
negative,for you are better off getting wired mouse this thing is so bad the sensor light bleeds through the top shell of the mouse worse is that the actual functionality is very poor if your are looking for an accurate mouse this is not it have multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use if you have plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable but if your on the go this will not do 
neutral,this is the second time purchase this mouse in matter of few months and the second one is already not working at all charged it and all and nothing have the rose gold one can you guys please send new one or refund me like the color matches my laptop well but refuse to keep re purchasing every other few months 
positive,works great with macbook pro thanks 
neutral,the keyboard just stopped working after month used different cable and used the usb of my alienware it started working again 
positive,not only is it pretty but it works great very smooth to the touch didn realize how bad my old mouse was until got this the charge lasts long time as well 
neutral,great product no issues
neutral,sleek look and battery lasts extremely long ve only had to charge it once since getting it highly recommend 
positive,it started out great for about days now it works for minutes and won move the cursor around 
positive,we should have saved our money spent on cheaper speakers and just bought this first great sound quality 
neutral,i like the charge this is my second one you can pair them together for stereo sound using the jbl app 
neutral,jbl over priced by far
positive,i purchased this mouse because needed new one for my work from home station came across this mouse and read some of the reviews and thought would take chance on it it has turned out to be one of the best things have purchased from amazon it is such smooth operating mouse and the color displays on it are really fun definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in search of wireless mouse 
positive,best keyboard for gaming works with xbox consoles and playstation consoles as well battery life is amazing only charged it twice since and only had it for months out of 
positive,the scrolling wheel is not working properly after months so have to buy new mouse the usb charging feature is nice though and it is easy to carry 
neutral,the charge does not last full day
neutral,my ue old lives it
positive,there nothing majorly egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn necessarily excel at anything the mouse is pretty light the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive the sleep mode is bit aggressive and find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again the dpi is by far the biggest problem it doesn feel like the dpi switch on the mouse actually does anything and it almost feels like the dpi changes randomly while in use ve noticed this behavior with mouse mat and on flat desk alone this may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless overall it definitely good enough for what needed cheap wireless rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work however wouldn use it for anything beyond that 
positive,i loved the changing colors and the ease of use love the slim look and feel while using it 
negative,doesn hold charge for very long has dead spots have to shake to get to move sometime
neutral,cool works 
positive,my brother has pair of jbl extremes and they sound great outdoors didn want to go that big and expensive so after some research purchased pair of charge one from amazon with points and one from meijer store at big discount knew that separately they are mono but planned on getting two paired them with my iphone downloaded the connect app and tried them out in my breezeway and wasn terribly impressed but that room has cedar walls and ceiling and all hard furniture so moved out to the patio incredible sound played some aaron diehl tom waits jade bird several genres exceeded my expectations after listening to just one speaker would say this might not be what you want if you re going to use one solo would probably consider the charge in that case but if you connect at least two speakers for stereo sound you won be disappointed 
positive,great speaker
positive,works very well but wish it had option for regular battery 
negative,the laser stop working after having the mouse for about months disappointing 
positive,happy with this speaker not too heavy and the bass is just about right for me similar in sound to sony old mega bass option 
negative,the crazy mouse will not hold charge have to plug it in after minutes of use defeats the purpose of wireless mouse my alkaline battery mouse would last for months and then just simple battery replacement do not buy 
neutral,quiet clicker
positive,best mouse have ever used very smooth and really sharp looking 
positive,this was gift for my boyfriend and might be stealing it from him xdit sounds really good indoors we haven tried outdoors yet the sound is clear and the bass sounds great was worried because of the comments saying that is mono trust me that is not even perceptible it sounds great we are not party persons so we have not thrown party using this speaker we connect it to the tv laptop or mobile and watch movies tv shows or listen music for these type of uses is perfect 
positive,it worked great while it worked but after less then three months my mouse has stopped working it turns on and lights up but will no connect to the usb wirelessly any more won buy again and wouldn recommend if you re looking for something to last 
positive,everything was fine with this set was in pinch and needed new one noise cancelation is good can ever hear what my sister or boyfriend are saying to me haha but don use the lights or anything just for mic and hearing
positive,the enter button is huge issue love the keyboard except for the place and shape of the enter key my finger hits that button and the enter button all the time the keyboard is perfect in everything else just can get passed that part returned the keyboard and ordered klim light rechargeable wireless keyboard us layout for that one has fix the enter button issue 
neutral,pretty much right after the return deadline the thing just stopped working broke not worth the money should ve sent it back to get my money back anyway 
neutral,does not work
positive,if like me your hat size is in the giant section these will work slide on and off easily without compromising sound 
positive,enjoying the sound quality
neutral,constant thumping would personally burn or smash
positive,so far pretty good my only complain would be that the microphone is too far from my mouth it makes it hard for other people to hear me 
neutral,for gaming good for the price 
positive,i have smaller jbl and loved it so much so decided to purchase this one as well love love love this jbl it has just the right bass too 
positive,i got this speaker as gift and he loves it the sound is incredible 
neutral,loved the idea of recharging had to charge midday sometimes wheel randomly died in the middle of my workday after months buying regular one next time 
positive,the mouse is big enough to use and very smooth with my computer always look for wireless mouse so this one is the best on amazon that could find highly recommended 
neutral,scrolling roller ball doesn function just freely spins without engaging 
positive,great sound definitely recommend and for the price forget about it
negative,the keyboard wouldn even charge or stay on you could charge it all day too watch it die in seconds the moment turned it on
positive,these headphones are so cool they re going to go perfect with the gaming mouse love these because they re good they work so good the best headphones ve ever had 
neutral,there are two light modes like the color changing option 
positive,great gaming gear 
positive,i bought this keyboard it worked great right out of the box for minutes then nothing thought maybe battery was dead so charged it for while it never turned on again thought maybe it the port so switched ports nothing thought maybe it the driver so fixed that still nothing thought it was the computer so funnily enough bought new one it does not work nothing you do will make this work this is paper weight at most like it feels nice to touch it does nothing it is just there to look nice it is mistake of creation and honestly using the accessibility keyboard works better than this tested it went and played wow using accessibility keyboard then used this obviously the accessibility keyboard was phenomenal in comparison mainly because this one does not work would pay to not have this in my memory 
neutral,the mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy remove it from my laptop when it not in use and put it back under the mouse its pretty difficult to remove it again without some kind of sharp edge feel like it will eventually break 
positive,soft click it light weight cute lights love it 
negative,unfortunately it been months and now it useless and unresponsive going to have to get rid of it now and get new one guess you get what you pay for 
positive,my year old son loves it lights match his led desk mouse pad lights and his lenovo legion gaming mouse along with his legion laptop it works well for virtual school this year and online gaming overall great purchase 
positive,this was for my son for school work and he loved the features and the fact that it has lights to make it fancy it seems pretty smooth without making clicking noise and compact pretty good alternative for expensive mouses from branded ones
positive,i can still hear my ps thought the noise cancelation would have been better and the mic quality is little muffled but everything else is great
positive,got them for my boyfriend and he loves them 
positive,loved this keyboard and it had been working great until last week numerous keys stopped working have done everything can think of to fix it but nothing works too bad because this was nice keyboard 
positive,excellent bluetooth speaker well built and also great sound quality links to harman kardon speakers and also other jbl speakers definitely recommend purchasing if you re looking for great sounding long lasting battery bluetooth speaker 
negative,after two days of using the mouse went dead and would not work again no matter how long charged it 
neutral,my grandson was so excited to use them with his playstation 
neutral,nice and compact
positive,excellent sound quality much louder than expected small enough to take just about anywhere ve gotten it pretty wet several times and still going strong great product 
positive,awesome
neutral,terrible not even stereo the cheaper flip had significantly better sound quality please don waste your time or money get the flip instead
neutral,after removing the new headphones from package we noticed defective area in the wire fortunately the headphones are working properly just hope it doesn continue to unwind my yr son really likes it for gaming and says its great sound quality comfortable cool and stylish however it does slide off his head and he has to keep readjusting but that doesn seem to bother him gave it stars due to defect 
neutral,doesn work
neutral,not thrilled with this returned bose bt speaker in exchange for this one bought this because am having hearing issues but sound quality seems bit muddy and fuzzy and didn realize until now that the sound is mono also the bluetooth feature seems unstable in my room where keep the wifi modem and several other bt electronics after some research discovered this speaker won function with too much wifi and bt interference bit frustrating probably going to return it works well in every room in the house except the room where need it the most tired of playing games every night to get bluetooth to work 
positive,absolutely comfortable and great sound would definately reorder in future
neutral,batteries are not staying charged longer than hours 
positive,these worked awesome for gaming supper happy noise canceling is perfect and love the color and comfortable worth the money for some cheaper headphones
neutral,my boyfriend literally had to scream for people to hear him
positive,awesome headset very sleek style and the noise canceling is amazing 
neutral,excelente 
positive,worked great in the beginning now it keeps disconnecting or won connect at all super fustrating it not even that old 
positive,perfect low profile for me not sure how long the charge will last with the led on but you can switch them off for the price nothing to complain about thanks
positive,scrolling is very easy and quick this mouse is slim and easy to manuver mostly love the ergonomic and backlighting design the sleep mode feature is nice just have to remember to turn the mouse off then on to reactivate the scrolling feature 
positive,sound is amazing and design is beautiful 
positive,they work good for the price would recommend buying for the price
positive,theee perfect headset for gaming 
positive,these work great for the online gaming do they are comfortable on my ears and the sound is great 
positive, update to prior review this mouse started out great was so excited about it at first then after couple months in all of the sudden the usb that goes into the computer just snaps breaks and ll add did nothing to it one day while working from home moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn functioning looked to see why then saw the usb had just cratered into couple pieces so now paid for nothing good lord my own money too not something my office will reimburse me for either nice work 
neutral,this mouse is junk the battery charge does not last it is rechargeable but you can use your computer while it is charging 
positive,great product
negative,this mouse is so sensitive if the surface is not absolutely debris free or flat signal signal won be sent from the wireless mouse to the computer screen ve had it for several weeks and have tried it with several mouse pads surfaces paper under the mouse it just not good fit like the changing light color it very pretty but for me not great wireless mouse 
positive,really appreciate the customer service klim provides quick responses and excellent keyboard 
negative,i got this mouse for my daughter it worked for the first few days then quit charging ve tried to charge with various cables and connectors but no success total waste of money would not recommend this product 
neutral,got them for my nephew he said he likes them just have to see how long they lay because he rough on them 
positive,this is one of the better speakers ive ever owned and love how you can charge your phone off of it
positive,great on the hand and adaptability to surface device
positive, this speaker sounds great thumpy punchy and in certain instances has deep booming bass mids highs are clear could be little more crisp and of course have more bass but it is full rich sound and using an eq brings out more of its capabilities jbl quality construction was on the fence about buying this because they went to mono driver but you can really tell difference in fidelity you can tell the bass is slightly deeper than the charge completely happy with it and love the green color one thing do not like is they took away the speaker phone put the speakerphone back that thing like and is missing on this as for connecting to older speakers with connect you can update the older speakers to connect plus to connect with the charge update liked it so much got another one camo these sound great it actually has bass no issues with connectivity or battery this is the best speaker in this class or category there are some that come close but these can be beat the price hike is downer don know what going on there that crazy got these for and that what they should be seems getting good reviews helps their sales and they take advantage by jacking up the price not cool at they aren that great would expect more at that price 
negative,ordered this and received on while the audio quality wasn high end by any stretch husband was happy with the way these felt and sounded in terms of my usage he used them for gaming and online chat but the microphone on off switch has broken after days of use rendering this headset completely useless for its intended purpose my husband has resorted to taping and gluing up the headset which was broken and unwearable because that headset still works this one not so much 
positive,awesome product buy it now 
positive,long battery life and great sound quality 
neutral,i don use this everyday maybe twice week love how quiet it is but the scroll button stopped working it now just continually spins 
positive,the mouse is very light and easy to use and the changing led colors are very nice to look at 
neutral,it matches my computer
positive,my son enjoyed it used it for gaming
neutral,stand need wider base it likes to roll around while drive car stereo took crap
neutral,this does not fit on my laptop the part that fits into the laptop to make the mouse work did not fit 
negative,one ear would go back and forth between working and not working sometimes whole set would stop working and this was straight out of the package severely disappointed
neutral,easy to use
positive,it arrived with slight crack picture of crack in front of keyboard attached this keyboard was purchased for my son to help with school from home since he was excited to use it and it would be helpful and since there pandemic didn want to have to ding around with going someplace to return it and didn want to be without it so far it works and the light up colors make him interested in using it which possibly translates to him doing better more timely job with his schoolwork hopefully the crack does not cause it to fail sooner than expected 
positive,i got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap it really feels like its made of trash it does seem to work well enough though the tracking is inconsistent at best the ergonomics are really non existent doesn seem like it made for human hands overall if you re buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it but if you actually care about having half decent mouse skip this one 
neutral,easy to use
positive,i really loved this mouse did not replace it with the same mouse however because the wheel broke only use this device for work not gamer or anything like that ve had wireless mice that do not break for years previously great color very cool looking will miss using this not sure if there is any warranty
neutral,like it
negative,i ordered my first mouse it broke in two weeks returned reordered this one broke just few days after the return window closed don waste your money 
neutral,doesn hold charge long
positive,i ve had the mouse for about month and it works great use it everyday for work hours and ve only have had to charge it once after the initial charge recommend for sure 
neutral,great for chat in gameplay but my only issue is the cord piece for lights is not nearly long enough to plug into system for power 
positive,great clarity
neutral,i liked the unit until it stopped functioning 
neutral,kept skipping wouldn track properly although right next to ipad
neutral,after month it will not hold charge junk have to keep it plugged up to use it
positive,works perfectly for my macbook sleek design with cool lights would buy again
neutral,it sounds amazing at low price
positive,for the price got this product so far is the best got in long long long time use to use microsoft always but was loosing my time love that is wireless and can take woth my everywhere go 
neutral,quality and matches the description like it 
positive,this light up mouse is great and ve had few similar ones like that this one is rounded on the edges more aesthetically pleasing imo it holds charge for long enough that it not annoying though it would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more the options are just on constant red light or cycles through colors clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get the only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only weeks of use intend to drop some wd onto it and sure that will fix the problem but don think that should be necessary to begin with overall good choice though immediate update directing wd into the wheel well of the mouse is not easy even using pin dropped the mouse and now the wheel doesn scroll at all it just spins soooooo not great removing star either accept the squeaky wheel or be very careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die ugh

positive,these are great for gaming love the way it feels on my head and great sound quality

positive,i purchased this mouse to replace the corded mouse in my office have used it for little over week now and am completely satisfied with the way it works and how my hand feels ergonomically speaking it is so much better than the standard chunkier mouses ve used most of my professional career my hand is in resting position while using it and remains free from stress and strain love it 
neutral,i had initially given this stars but it stopped charging after couple of weeks asked for replacement and received different version of the one initially had that never held charge returning both of them for refund 
neutral,the charging stopped working after months and entire mouse stopped working after months
neutral,the dongle was so hard to get out that when did pry it free from the tape it shot across the room never to be seen again now have piece of plastic can charge and need to order working keyboard 
positive,the priced paid for this product and what you receive is amazing thanks for the great product 
positive,the only complaint have about this headset is the cord it gets very twisted up guess it the material wrapped around the actual cord idk but besides that for the price it great headset

neutral,in this price range these headphones are top notch replaced my former pair same brand with these and have no complaints 
neutral,exactly what it says quite and convenient mouse 
neutral,long lasting battery

positive,it is exactly as depicted my old mouse just wasn working correctly even with new battery was banging on it to get it to respond this one is just as advertised changes colors and responds on just slight touch love it 
positive,it perfect mic it has everything necessary for ps pc or xbox gaming
neutral,sound quality not as good as what was expecting and battery life not as long as advertised
neutral,took it out of the box set it up minutes later it stopped working completely 
neutral,i found one of these on the street back in the winter that had fallen off someone bike or car after unsuccessful attempts to find the owner ended up keeping it figured after being dropped and rained on it wouldn work but it did the sound is maybe not the best you could find but it not at all terrible if you want something rugged that you can take to the water this would be good speaker 
positive,great product quality 
neutral,would totally recommend 
negative,mouse only right clicks making it useless have read others are having this problem too went into computer settings everything is set up right mouse does not work
positive,my husband uses this all the time we have used this almost daily inside and outside it quite loud no weenie tin box here actually like to get one more so we can sync them up and use them in two different areas hopefully soon hear that the new version won sync with the older model so please keep this one available 
neutral,fully charged it still started cutting out within an hour of use and now doesn connect at all 
positive,nice mouse if it worked the first one purchased worked for about month when the scrolling wheel broke the company replaced it free of charge now six months later the second one has quit working won hold charge 
neutral,thought it was gonna boom nice sound but just not very loud haven charged it in like months tho so that lit
neutral,headset wire way to longusb wire way to short
neutral,it is really quiet and colorful 
neutral,update the company contacted me and sent me new headphone with mic it arrived few days ago and it works they mentioned they are sourcing their mic parts from new supplier hopefully their quality will improve my son used this for few hours each week for months then the microphone quit working the product has pathetic useful life put your dollars towards another headset this one is worthless 
positive,best mouse ve ever bought so glad got it perfect for my job 
positive,we like it sounds great
neutral,just wondering however is there way to control the lights brightness color etc 
positive,i have really enjoyed the sound quality of this bluetooth device it is small and portable but sturdy love the box it came in to keep it protected and easy to store 
neutral,i originally had rated these lower because they did not work with our xbox one controllers after days of using however after even more fiddling around we found out we needed to update the controller firmware once we did that the headset worked again 
neutral,description of this item list that it has led lights there are no lights 
positive,love this speaker
neutral,this is the cheapest thing have ever seen the quality is horrible holding it in my hand feels like it weighs nothing it is extremely cheap the lights are neat tho they should be ashamed selling this for anymore then 
neutral,when listening while doing chores it needs to carry through every room and this speaker does the trick through dog barks and other household noises can still hear the song or speaker the only drawback is that the bluetooth does not connect to other generations of jbl speakers threes connect only with other threes fours connect only with fours it would not have changed my particular purchase and circumstance but will affect my future purchases because will match the system for linking 
neutral,the good thing is this mouse is cheap but it feels like it too the wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should
negative,don buy it for one is very inconvenient rechargeable you never know when mouse is out of juice two mouse is dead after just months
positive,sounds ok but was expecting better in sound
positive,great product
positive,it comes clean mine is dirty because eat while doing homework glows perfectly and comes with charger and plug in for your computer 
neutral,it taken me while to remember to turn it on after it sits awhile 
neutral,was little squirrely to use
neutral,i started using this product exactly month ago it will not work now unless it plugged into the charger which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse can recommend 
positive,great for gaming
positive,cord gets super hot when trying to charge using my lap top and not charging
neutral,mouse wheel randomly broke months after purchasing mouse pretty disappointed in this 
negative,when received this item it was thin which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side then simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered and to stop it off sometimes the cursor goes everywhere which can be annoying when you re working on particular items love it for the lights and how compact it is handle this item with care 
positive,this speaker has great sound quality it is easy to use and very good quality overall my son bring it everywhere 
positive,the good part about it is very convenient and it saves lot in batteries and you can still use it when charging to the laptop also the lights lets you know when is time to charge it like it lot
positive,awesome
neutral,i liked the fact that it uses no battery but the charge does not last too long 
negative,too much bother to charge when at the office cannot leave on my desk for fears of loosing it
positive,i like the feel and look of this mouse bought it as deal of the day really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels also love that you can recharge it only dislike is that review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something wasn trying to type ll have to undo whatever did other than that good price and quality 
positive,the mouse clic is silent it feels very ergonomic at hand the battery lasts pretty good my daughter loves itthe lights are so nice specially at night with the room lights offgive it try
positive,the lighting is very nice and the key are soft kind if know wut mean
negative,this keyboard does not work properly am not sure if mine is defective or not but reading other reviews can see that other people have similar issue would be in the middle of typing sentence and it misses about of the letters in the sentence it appears to be battery issue the keyboard barely charges the blue light for charging turns off within minute of plugging it in and then minutes later the keyboard starts being unresponsive again and you have to unplug it and then plug it back in for it to work again properly 
neutral,very efficient
neutral,i have been able to use this product since aug and then out of the blue the roller wheel stopped working like it disconnected from the internal workings and now wont scroll this is very disappointing

positive,i love this little mouse very well built and sturdy dropped it twice and nothing happened to it the colors do not fade fun lighting reliable and very long charging battery life use it almost every day and haven had to charge it in weeks ended up buying another one for my daughter and it just as well made 
positive,this thing sounds amazing 
positive,works like it should if your looking for good headset for the price this is it you wont get the beats by dre experience but not bad over all 
positive,i bought this for my year old for gaming was shocked at how good the sound quality is and the noise cancelling features also very comfortable to wear for long periods 
positive,for the price paid for this headset it amazing it actually the closest to the more expensive high quality headset that have found so far it pretty good at blocking out background noise the sound effects and voices are clear to hear and can go pretty loud if you choose to turn the volume up it sits quite comfortably on my head have smaller head as female and also wear glasses when gaming so was thoroughly surprised to find there wasn too much pressure on my glasses or my ears would highly recommend this headset 
positive,the klim chroma is an excellent gaming keyboard for the price 
neutral,worked fine for month now it doesn hold charge and if wanted it to work need to tape the charger into very specific spot cheaply made piece of crap
positive,easy to pair with phone computer etc great sound quality and size 
positive,i admit was going to return this item because did not understand the little usb attachment was on the bottom of the device had charged it but was using the little black usb insert in my laptop which did not work once inserted the white short usb from underneath the pointer my computer accepted it and it works great am still learning how to use these devices at age it is gorgeous and works 
positive,this was good product in all my other headset brpke so got was shoked that it had prety good of everything 
neutral,good audio and mic quality for cheap price also comes with the adapter for pc use only complaint have is the earmuffs are little small and hurts my ears after extended sessions

negative,i was very disappointed when the mouse stopped responding after few weeks of using it
neutral,very quite clicking 
neutral,i ve had this speaker for days under year and it won take charge anymore the sound was decent but don recommend that much money should buy batter that lasts longer either cheap parts or bad design 
positive,quick and easy set so easy didn realize it was set up 
positive,worth for every penny great sound decent microphone and very comfortable would buy it again 
neutral,packaging from amazon was not great box split wide open surprisingly no damage 
positive,this speaker is super durable have dropped it multiple time and it works just fine and it is super loud recommend this speaker
negative,charge didn last all day and then delay kept getting longer simply don have time to hook it to cord and there no battery charge option 
neutral,this mouse will not stay connected to my computer
negative,i ve had for lass than month and it already doesn work anymore left it on for couple hours while was away fully charged and working perfectly when left and when came home it refused to work have charged it have taken out the usb and reinserted it and have turned it off and on million times and it just doesn work anymore am so incredibly disappointed and upset that this broke after less than month and cannot return it as don have the original packaging anymore would give negative stars if could wish could get my money back to buy different mouse but unfortunately can anymore don waste your money on this 
positive,absolutely love it kinda bought this last year black friday and it was bucks when did but the bass is deep dropped it pretty hard once but no problem the battery lasts for good but if you don use it constantly 
positive,the sound quality was great my year old son uses the headphones and loves the look and the lights 
neutral,you do have to press key to activate lighting unlike some other keyboards you only have to touch not big problem just press the ctrl key to fire it up 
neutral,chord way to long spit part for lights doesn fit into series controller so its just useless kinda low volume mic is ok
neutral,purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port no batteries required it is also compact with low profile it will be great for travel because it will take up very little space fits easily in pocket without bulging out 
positive,ive been huge fan of the charge series since the charge owning every speaker in between then and now this speaker was seriously very minor upgrade if not downgrade from the charge tbh the sound quality is still there personally prefer the sound of the charge over this one think due to the having drivers and this one having single slightly bigger driver the seems to be alittle more bass heavy surprisingly since its slightly smaller over all youre still getting the jbl signature sound it still sounds great still think its worth stars waterproof abilities are amazing and the battery life is totally better the battery on the charge seemed to poop out on me but only after like years which wasnt to hard to fix maybe the number of the speaker is the life expectancy tune in next time to find out on stephens reviews 
positive,bought this for my husbands gaming and it was great sounds quality is excellent 
positive,i loved my mouse and it worked great loved the light show and the fast response time with no lagging from the mouse then at weeks into having the mouse the type reciever that made the mouse work broke off was so bummed because really liked the mouse so took leap of faith and contacted the company to ask for replacement on just the receiver so that could use my mouse and they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and sent me brand new set at no cost lovely lady named iris helped me out thank you for being an honest company that stands behind the products you sell customer for life don hesitate to buy this item you wont regret it 
neutral,i have held back writing review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after while it has not been the case for me have had it for several months now and it is very reliable and maintains all of its functions intact would recommend the mouse 
neutral, update since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering refund if took the review down when didn reply they offered me refund again in return would have to remove the review they stated they were small company and my review was hurting them but with over reviews don see how that possible the light goes off like it is charged however it won turn on more than about seconds ve tried different charging cords and same thing happens don waste your money 
positive,this headset is very good for how much it costs it is very good for children that sit down and play video games for while 
positive,works great long battery life love that it turns itself off very smooth used
neutral,this mouse came in handy when needed it most after my other one came up missing 
negative,i should ve listened others review read but thought it might be some specific situation but my the bluetooth don work at all and now have to trouble myself with all the returning work 
positive,stops working week after buying do not waste your money mine won stay connected to my computer constantly having to reconnect it
neutral,it was working fine busted it maybe times max and it stopped workingit looks to be charging but isn when placed into on mode the red light flashes and goes off right away 
neutral,the product fits well in my hand and has quiet click but it keeps on cutting out will walk away for minute and the mouse does not work anymore so have to unplug it turn it off then back on and replug it in 
neutral,there are multiple times the keyboard does not register my keystrokes causing typos in word processing and issues when gaming defeats the purpose of having keyboard imo it looks nice though 
neutral,i have owned many jbl speakers this one is the worst it cuts out all the time love my jbl charge wish would have bought another 
positive,i bought this mouse because needed wireless mouse for work it came in cheap box written in mostly chinese it is nice color and it was easy to setup used this for work for weeks and today went to use it and it stopped working it didn register on the computer am sending this back for refund and ll just get logic tech 
positive,i love this mouse for the most part the colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand the only downside is that the right click has tendency to stick even when am only using the left click ve had it for few days now and that the only negative 
positive,great item and came so quick thank you 
negative,i picked this up because was looking for quiet wireless keyboard the reviews and product information said this was the one for me but it disappointing the keys are quiet but the space bar is so loud and rickety that it more than makes up for the quiet keys and since using this to type all day and not game the space bar gets hit lot ll deal with it and the other features of the keyboard are fine but this is disappointment to me 
positive,awesome out of the box excellent sound qualitybut longevity is major issue never dropped heated or abused unit in any way used charging cable and followed chargingh directionsbut the unit now doesnt charge anymorethis is defect in build quality its not acceptable to fail this early
neutral,great sound for what it is we use it mostly by the pool and so don cart it around much but it be plenty light to take camping or to the beach charging port failed within first year even without water exposure 
positive,a little heavy at first but get used to it quickly comfortable good sound
positive,love it
positive,i like the size and how easy it is to use
neutral,excelente
positive,love the product will probably order another color 
positive,my headphones had just died so bought this to replace them and it works amazingly the sound is great quality and the noise cancelling is fantastic 
neutral,liked the colors and style east set up but after about weeks of use the scroller stopped working and fell off track only used it few times out of those weeks 
positive,i have used this for days realistically less bc it only used it won hold charge now and dies before lunch despite being plugged up over night 
negative,love how it looks and feels but out the box it was really glitchy charged it and saw that it was still sticking bit as was using it since it mouse the one thing it should do is move smoothly ya know don know if this was just this one mouse or it how it runs either way it really annoying when you re trying to get things done 
neutral,it was for my grandson and no complaints from him so guess it is fine
neutral,very good
positive,the sound quality and comfort of the headphones were fine but despite all the options available to me my friends couldn hear me when using the mic 
positive,great sound so bought thanks
positive,nice quality beautiful cards 
positive,i have purchased many gaming headphones for my sons these are the first that not only work but work extremely well they were also the easiest to set up the sound quality is great and guessing that they have fabulous noise cancellation capabilities as my sons seem to not be able to hear me when they re wearing them 
neutral,starting using on april and when came back to my desk yesterday it had completely stopped working can not charge it tried on multiple computers and the computers won acknowledge it if it not plugged in directly which defeats the purpose of the wireless chargeable mouse don buy if you are looking for long term option and can find way to contact the company the only option amazon gives me is to leave review can not contact the seller 
positive,smooth feeling keys nice design
neutral,hmmm
positive,i am pleasantly pleased with this mouse it attractive looking and works very well it comes with usb adapter along with the charging cable in case you need one plug and play actually worked no complaints about this mouse and would purchase again if need an additional one 
neutral,worked great for about weeks then died never to be used again 
neutral,i was looking at this mouse when my cat jumped on my lap and hit the buy now button turned out to be pretty good mouse true story but she can write reviews so she may be little disappointed
positive,just perfect 
positive,very bright sound quality and feedback is on point no lagging voices recommend 
neutral,do not buy the product does not work for intended purposes using as mouse for my computer it lights up and thats it can leave zero stars would if could 
positive,got this mouse for my desktop setup which mainly use for office purposes and it has been working great it replaced cheaper version than this one that got at below of which did not expect much but got me going for years don think would recommend for gaming since is little on the small side and somewhat flat but who knows is it very responsive thought and looks nice with the changing colors 
neutral,works as advertised and looks great little bulky for my tastes but it does its job note as others mentioned the wording on the headset itself is different than in the picture displayed but it is the same model would star it if it was little more comfy for long hours of use but after an hour or two because of its weight and bulk it really starts to become uncomfortable for me 
neutral,kittens destroyed my sons last headset he picked these out they are working great 
positive,purchased as gift for my nephew he really likes it 
positive,love it
neutral,for gaming
neutral,purchased and plugged in it worked for bit did computer restart then they never worked again returned them hours after they were delivered then went to brick and mortar store and purchased name brand 
neutral,i have been using this mouse for weeks now and have no complaints it goes to sleep on its own and comes back on easily with click no delays or problems connecting to bluetooth do wish had way to know what the battery life was but just hook it up every days and it hasn died on me yet 
positive,got these for trip and was surprised at the build as well as the sound quality with the price of them the build could feel little better the ear cups creating better seal and the mic location or if it could move more inward other than that they sound great and feel comfortable 
neutral,it light and works for long time on battery power but the keyboard lighting leaves much to be desired
neutral,sound lags from time to time
neutral,sleek and ergonomic to the touch 
neutral,working good made sturdyhappy with purchase
positive, love everything about this product like the setup and quick syncing to my monitor and system 
positive,updated the customer service is amazing and so thanks to them was able to get replacement that is much more comfortable and even better sound quality

neutral,stoped working since the first day doesn hold the charge and gets disconnected have to turn it on and off few times in order to connect it again to the computer don recommend to by this product 
positive,great sound for gaming
negative,upon receiving the mouse charged it with the charging cable used it for considerable amount of time and plugged it in upon plugging it in there was an odd smell the smell was the cable starting to melt unplugged it and will not be using it again lucky that didn walk away or my place could have caught on fire what disappointment 
positive,good sound qualityfits my heads well
positive,the slime design makes it easy to transport the usb piece fits nicely under neither when it goes into sleep move just click the button and its back up and running 
positive,works great with my xbox
positive,developers really did number with this device this mouse speaks for itself it is actually just what the marketing team indicated awesome am customizable type of consumer thus enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm this led mouse wowed me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage very well crafted and look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress 
positive,so far my daughter used these with her switch and with xbox one and she says they work great
negative,the ergonomics are good but it has fatal flaw that makes it unusable when you first turn it on it works fine but after minutes or so it becomes very twitchy or jerky and completely unusable tried it on both macs and pcs same problem with both systems it too cheap to bother sending back but want to warn others not to make the same mistake 
neutral,i bought this as wireless mouse have used it for less than month and it doesn hold charge unless it plugged in will be returning it and do not recommend this product 
positive,iupdated returned and bought another as really liked the way it fit my hand etc the first one didn get charged til it was out and then wouldn recharge after it died ve plugged this one to charge more frequently and am happy to keep it not going to let it die cuz don want to suffer finding out it design flaw on the other hand could have just been the one first bought am so disappointed received my pretty mouse charged it and love it fits my small hands no clicking sounds easy to use received it around july today is july and the cursor won work hadn charged it so plugged it in to charge the wheel still works but the clicker won work when press it nothing happens would exchange it for new one but then don have many days left to see if it works and really don want to take chance on losing my money these mice seem to work great for some and don work for some may figure out which credit card gives year warranty beyond the normal one which is non existent at least could try again 
negative,i liked the design of this product but after two weeks it stopped working kept having to turn it on and off to get it to track at all disappointed 
positive,the mouse is cool comfortable to use but not fan of the sleep mode it annoying but still like the mouse love the color shifting feature too
positive,the headline says it all these sound great and have pretty good noise cancellation but they are very uncomfortable could only wear them for short amount of time before reverting back to my old headphones ended up throwing them away because won use them 
positive,clarity all the way great product
neutral,worked for minutes the first time turned on the mouse and then it just completely stopped working with my macbook charged it for days and still does not work 
positive,this is an absolutely awesome keyboard it wireless and doesn run on batteries and is chargeable through usbc hubby is using it for ps gaming if that helps anyone 
neutral,worked great before it died after months of ownership 
neutral,very stiff and plasticy the lights dont work unless you have bunch of adapters and connecters mic part broke after couple months 
positive,the mouse is very pretty and lights up pretty silent when in use its small in size
positive,we love this speaker awesome sound with deep bass 
positive,stopped working after the second week charged it overnight every night before left the office and it was working fine then it started skipping so tried to put it on the charger for the day and used another mouse thinking maybe it just didn charge the night before then when took it off it wouldn work at all but it does feel great in your hands and the lighting is pretty cool just wish it would have lasted 
neutral, it rechargeable and automatically goes to sleep mode when not using easy to use works great 
neutral,works great would prefer if it would not light up like rainbow 
positive,out of the box had to call support because it sounded like it was skipping but after factory reset its working was expecting deeper bass and higher highs but all in all its good speaker
positive,great sound long battery life 
positive,i ordered this mouse really liked it it was slim fit nicely in my hand and loved how the lights changed colors after few months there was problem with it when the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked great customer service would order it again after dealing with them if hadn already bought another mouse because had work to finish give them stars
neutral,its very comfy to wear and its colors are really cool
positive,my son sats the are awesome and they have lasted longer then other headphones have purchased for him great price 
negative,it doesn work correctly connection is bad
negative,it works well but wouldn call it quiet which is shame because that the main reason bought this product 
positive,i ve tried other jbl bluetooth speakers in past years to be clear ve tried many dozens listened for hours tested usually reviewed and ve kept the ones that think have something special good sound thought after few more generations jbl may have figured out how to nail together decent thing was wrong buy bose soundlink mini listen to it figure out how to do better than that it has half the volume of this thing and sounds indisputably bigger better jbl don cry bose also completely beefed it with their own new generation revolve speakers they had spectacular speakers in the soundlink iii and especially the brilliant and nonpareil soundlink mini and decided to make the awful revolve speakers they may get notch louder and sound like muddy garbage but it round and that makes it better for parties congratulations we ve discovered idiocracy sony is even worse leading the charge into irrelevance starting with the srs and improving it by making the srs xb great bass for speaker its size if only great sound was produced by bass alone it doesn produce any midranges or treble speakers by idiots for idiots anyway jbl has never made great bluetooth speaker so suppose th generation speaker that still sucks isn really giving anything up just want the world to know that this speaker just ain great there better richer more articulate deep and mid bass in the bose soundlink mini at half the size it not waterproof and suppose people who need speakers with round cabinets probably also need to listen to music around pools most of the time and can figure out any effective way to prevent their speakers from falling in so maybe the jbl is great for certain type of person 
positive,really love the jbl speakers this is the fourth one we ve purchased you can link them together great for football tailgating too 
neutral,does the job 
positive,works as expected very comfortable sound quality is good great price
positive,here are few major issues bought this keyboard for main reasons it was supposed to be ergonomic silent lit up and good qualityergonomic this is not ergonomic it black ordinary keyboard with some lights silent keyboard this is not silent it is the loudest keyboard have had in years lights thought you could decide what lights shine through the keyboard nope you get to pick how bright it is and whether it solid breathing flickering or off the color pattern never changes the worst part is after seconds of not using the keyboard all of the lights turn off which is really problematic when it dark and you are relying on the lights to see they letters quality it feels like cheap plastic overall give this stars would not purchase it again 
positive,some of the reviews on how this mouse did not work after the first use caused me apprehension but given the price took the risk it is just what needed and it is really pretty as well great product 
neutral,camping fishing yard work 
positive,seem like really good bang for the buck 
positive,i have lot of back issues which causes me to be up all hours of the night so to keep my mind off of it will play on my gaming laptop and it would drive my wife nuts in the middle of the night hearing the clicking of the mouse got this yesterday and absolutely love it and so does she she cannot hear the mouse one bit and the led lighting is absolutely beautiful it goes so well with my backlight keyboard would recommend this mouse to anyone 
neutral,i plugged it in to charge for hours the moment unplugged it it wouldn turn on and wouldn connect to my laptop but if it was plugged in it worked and connected wanted wireless mouse not something that needed to be plugged into charger to work im working from home on laptop and wanted something that worked but now have to wait longer for mouse that actually works

neutral,nice and soft but the laser isn very accurate
positive,i ve hooked this up to my ps to use while playing ffxiv and it seamlessly works to type better than the controller does still have to use the controller to get to the chat box but that doesn bug me love the coloring great for use in the dark 
positive,works like charm
positive,i ve been using this mouse for work since received this last month it worked great the whole time and charged it once week now it won turn in thought it needed to be charged so plugged it in for few hours turned it back on and it won work at all normally the lights are all on when the switch is on it won even pick up my cursor and have to use different mouse to work very disappointed that it didn even last me more than month don waste your money edit the seller emailed me offering me money to delete my review sounds like they do that to everyone seems like there would be way more negative reviews for this trash product if they weren paid to delete them 
positive,works great 
negative,edit the seller reached out and offered refund on the item if they follow through would delete the review microphone doesn work on smartphone tried with games karaoke and phone calls dead mic 
neutral,the worst keyboard iver ever had to use came from amazon wow im shocked 
neutral,this does not work with my xbox one repeat does not work and now stuck with it forever
positive,works great and has great sound 
positive,i like how smooth it is it moves across the screen easily the buttons click nicely my hand doesn hurt after hours of gaming the sleep mode is great perk to save charging time overall one of the best purchases ve made for myself in long time 
positive,over all is very good if you ask love stereo sound 
neutral,the mouse itself was fine at first worked great and liked the shape and sound but the wheel started to squeak and it always scrolled too fast for my liking and now the mouse won work at all always jumping around the screen spinning lagging or unresponsive really annoying when trying to play games it does this when the battery is getting low too not fan it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on and now it won even read on my mousepad at all it has to be on the desktop to make it work even poorly 
positive,i needed new headset for both my work pc and for my ps this is the one my co workers can hear me loud and clear and my gf doesn throw things at me because she sleeping and the rats have eaten me again and don hear her snoring while stealthing my way through village very comfortable fit even on my giant noggin 
neutral,for year the mouse did well however it eventually needed charged in less time frames it finally shorted out this was my nd purchase after the first shorted out within few weeks permanent sleep mode 
positive,it works amazing it nice for traveling you hear clearly the battery works and last long
positive,my boys loved it for xbox and playstation
positive,a tad large and heavy but has good sound doesn carry as well as would like for on my bus
positive,impressed by some headphones my only gripe is the mic is on the left side of your face and you cant rotate the mic to switch it to the right other than that happy 
positive,wanted keyboard to work with by xbox this works really well and am glad made the purchase 
neutral,i tried charging this mouse but every time take it off the charger it goes off this was the first time even using it too

positive,love this mouse it lives up to its description 
positive,works well and really pretty
positive,i love this worth this money 
neutral,didn work 
neutral,it really good for gaming and how it cancels some of the noise outside 
neutral,there something wrong with this mouse and see not alone if leave it alone for like minutes it stops working and can be woken back up ve tried powering it on and off unplugging the usb charging the dang thing just decided not to work any more returning 
negative,piece of junk already broken irritated
neutral,the headphones echo when your gaming and noise cancellation sucks
negative,i ve had these for quite some time now and they ve stood up against use by myself in my year old and year old my only problem is that they do not work on my ps however they work fine for my xbox one with no need to buy anything extra not sure exactly what missing for them to not be working other than that which is disappointing considering wanted one pair for all my systems they work nicely for the price and look good 
neutral,a dependable mouse for regular use not gaming thank you for smooth transaction 
neutral,mouse is too small for my hands
neutral,the lights on the side of the mouse are not as bright as thought they would be but still like the mouse none the less quiet clicking charges quickly 
positive,i often as we all do use my laptop in less than bright conditions and prefer keyboard that flashes along with my typing this one was purchased for when up at our cabin had received it in march took it up then hadn used it again until recently in june when went back up was typing away and caught that the letter wasn working since have one of those in my name it sorta important pulled out the information in the little black envelope that came with the keyboard and found it to be entertaining sent message to contact us and vincent replied he the man with the hats all is well my replacement flashes the and the discovered that afterwards all are present now the new one also has fully lit characters which led me to realize that they all were only half lit with the first keyboard highly recommend this keyboard and klim technologies 
neutral,stopped working from one day to the next 
positive,i know it is better to give than to receive and am so happy my mother in law loved this gift she was used to staticky radio broadcasts of her favorite programs this speaker sounds so much better than mine now want one the battery life is impressive and the sound quality is great hard to believe this thing is splash proof 
neutral,works great has lasted longer than most but still less expensive 
positive,this mouse works great and love that it rechargeable just plug it in to my laptop for couple hours and we re good to go 
positive,i like that this mouse has sleek look to it slim ergonomic good quality not cheap looking like the color options available very easy set up ve been using it for couple of weeks now and it works great have not used it for gaming great price and will likely buy my next mouse for different computer have from the same place 
positive,this mouse is wonderful and easy to use without mouse pad which is big plus bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does stick out the side of my laptop to far it is rechargeable and lasts for while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors totally worth the buy 
neutral,wouldn recommend have been trying to charge it for days 
neutral,worth of purchase 
neutral,this is very nice product the mouse does not need pad can work on the bare desk on sheet of paper etc my device does not have multiple leds only red or the software use does not employ all its features but there is no need to complain will buy again without hesitation 
positive,they have great sound and they feel super comfortable there not that bag for price 
neutral,it functions according to my expectation 
positive,love it
neutral,overrated definitely can tell it mono sound quality would get the sony with fuller sound and ldac quality regret choosing this over sony due to deal not worth it 
positive,my son loves it it the first day having it but far so good ve bought other head sets before that won even connect 
positive,this is exactly the keyboard was looking for soft keys press easily wireless and the rainbow lights are bonus got thro keyboards about every years next time will not have search for what want because will definitely be buying this one again they do not last forever and now that know exactly what works the best for me will go to this keyboard again and again for all future purchases saw alot of other cool stuff on their site so will be picking up few more items from klim soon 
positive,this mouse was purchased for use with my laptop ve purchased two of the same brand previously but wanted something different so took chance on this unknown the mouse is light and ergonomic have fairly small hand and it fits well connection was simple the sleep mode will definitely increase battery life add to this the pretty lights and lovely rose color pleasantly surprised would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive and uncomplicated addition to their setup 
neutral,mouse does not take charge when it dies do not recommend this product to anyone 
neutral,it works really good
neutral,i literally just pulled this speaker out of the box turned it on and paired it to my iphone sounded amazing then went to charge it and it turned off and it won turn on at all tried all the troubleshooting steps and it still dead what the hell 
positive,sleep mode and charge life is great
positive,i was stunned by the quality of this great wireless mouse with charging port it never needs battery since it is built in ve used the mouse for months and without recharging it goes and goes winner 
positive,i like the sound quality use it for variety of things and it surpassed my expectations love it 
positive,this product is marketed on amazon as being compatible with ps but the usb it uses is incompatible with the console due to gimmicky aesthetic design choices that make it too large to fit past the playstations protruding faceplate 
positive,this are the best gaming headphones that ever seen in my life 
positive,i have many wireless mouses mice trying to find the right one for my home office studio bought this one for the slim design in the matte black finish it arrived and have never used mouse that this quiet before it insane it feels great when use it it smooth and very ergonomic this was definitely worth the price and may replace my other wireless devices with this model 
positive,it barely works when you just plug the aux in but when you plug the usb or the mic in it low volume if it works it won output to the right audio setting or something idk ve troubleshooted it for too long giving up 
positive,initially had an issue with the battery but the seller reached out and corrected quickly appreciate the support 
neutral,dislike
neutral,keyboard over all is ok space bar sucks as it only works dead center and is very clicky did not want wireless unit but when you change to jet black you don get any choice it just shows up that way even though in black it is wired beware
positive,so definitely stars here the sould it really good they even fit my big head issue never thought had big ears but these don fit my ears right and after bit they start to hurt slightly just take min break and potty or something and then back at it played for hrs straight the first day can fault them 
neutral,i liked the product all around overall
neutral,nice
neutral,tried this product on three different computers could not get the unit to work on any of them charged as per the instructions and using the usb the driver was found however the unit would not operate at all 
positive,great product
positive,it great mouse to have if you are trying to have mouse that can be used on type only device while keeping the option of normal usb open 
neutral,would buy again
positive,it amazing so glad treated myself to this speaker 
positive,i love this mouse cool color scheme and comfy to use
positive,works great
positive,at first it felt cheap but pretty much like all other perfect for what needed 
neutral,the mouse stopped taking charge from the charger after months
positive,the sound is so perfect not too bassy and very clear even with the spoken word needs an charger which is new to me it comes with short one but wanted longer anker one just wish the on light wasn so bright 
neutral,the speaker or mic did not work 
neutral,once fully discharged couldn get it to work again even after charging for multiple hours multiple times
positive,just what was looking for to use at work great sound for such small speaker 
positive,great sound and color options battery life last between and hours definitely brand ll stick with
neutral,good enough keyboard really regret getting it though as have to charge it every week so it would have been better for me to have just gotten wired keyboard or one that takes batteries 
negative,very long battery life bass can drown out treble at high volumes 
positive,i haven had any issues at all using this mouse it feels great the silent clicks and led lights add really cool touch to it as well 
neutral,the technology is great but ergonomic it is not
positive,the headphones were great got them for my nine year old and he loved them overall good headphone
neutral,works well with windows 
positive,the size is perfect for me it is portable so can listen wherever am 
positive,great
positive,it days past the return deadline and this item is not working any longer wow
positive,ok so gave star for gaming because do not know if this is good keyboard for gaming just use it as regular keyboard for my mac book pro my friend has one he uses for gaming and loves it the reason why bought this for regular usage was because went to my friends room to print out some documents and used this keyboard it felt great looked cool and was super comfortable to use plus liked the backlit lights of course so this is my reasoning for buying it and it did not disappoint have used it for few weeks now love it and will stick to this brand and style of keyboard from now on 
positive,updated used to be stars now find the lighted keyboard distracting but when turn the light off can see the characters on the keys had to buy stickers for the keys so could use the keyboard without the light on this hopefully will help my second issue which is having to recharge the thing when it starts misbehaving wireless ought to mean no need for wires would prefer batteries easier to replace batteries every couple of months than to recharge every week otherwise the keyboard is fine update the mouse in this combo became laggy after about month taking second or two to respond when used it that lag has increased to the point that today am still waiting for my cursor to respond an hour after booting up new battery made no difference useless ordering different brand today 
neutral,not even months and they broke can even get ahold of manufacturer 
positive,very slim easily fits in my laptop case led lights work great and add fun touch to the mouse no connection issues 
neutral,this speaker is definitely not the loudest but decent for the price built well durable bass quality and sound quality good not great very serviceable but they have higher quality and loader speakers available for more money 
positive,keys feel good under your fingers rgb is very cool
positive,the fact that it has quiet mechanism no sound whatsoever during clicking was great but even though only used it for my desktop computer at work days week it is not working right now did not carry it around or used it for more than hour during each day basically because use my laptop most of time months is pretty premature time frame to not function 
positive,works as expected wish is nice because the refurbished one did not 
negative,i have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about months of use it stopped holding charge and cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless then it completely went out on me and can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing update now being offered money to remove my comment no will not can care less about my money back want what paid for and refund shouldn be contigent upon removing my comment again don buy 
positive,i love the feel of this mouse it is comfortable easy to set up rechargeable wireless and the lights are so pretty fast shipping and quality packaging would highly recommend 
positive,great mouse setup was breeze cool rgb changing colors long lasting battery 
positive, the mouse is low profiled easy to use it connects instantly and is ready to use as soon as you plug the adapter into your computer it is very comfortable to use and the video shows it extra cool light show 
neutral,the wheel just spins and is not working anymore only days after purchased it returns are only within days can afford to buy new one every days so ll have to try different brand and seller 
positive,i really loved this mouse did not replace it with the same mouse however because the wheel broke only use this device for work not gamer or anything like that ve had wireless mice that do not break for years previously great color very cool looking will miss using this not sure if there is any warranty
positive,i love this mouse it is very lightweight with an attractive look one of my favorite features is that it is rechargeable second you have the option of selecting one color default to red or multiple colors swap automatically the switch is on the bottom portion of the mouse my favorite feature is the fact that the mouse goes into sleep mode when you turn off your computer saved me so many times from having dead mouse it can also be charged while in use overall would definitely recommend this mouse to friends and family 
positive,i really like this mouse it perfect size and love that it charges holds the charge for long time 
positive,great gaming keyboard
neutral,as soon as it ran out of charge the mouse died permanently tried charging it for hours in the hopes that full charge would cause it to work again but it didn would not recommend this mouse 
neutral,not worth the value
neutral,audio is inconsistent and cuts out mic also sounds like garbage 
negative,the mouse is light weight and like the colors it is also smooth and charge lasts for while however just bought it in may and today in august the usb broke off in the usb port of my computer the metal part detached from the plastic part disappointed 
neutral,okay understood that having mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life just didn expect this the mouse seems to have no sleep mode the lights stay on unless it completely switched off and the battery lasts less than two days brand new thought to myself that could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night because do like how the mouse feels and works except last night plugged it in and this morning hours later it wasn done charging have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it which kind of defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse in the first place and ties up two usb ports instead of just one shame back to the drawing board on my mouse search 
neutral,i got it for my husband he chose his colors lol
positive, awesome mouse is totally silent durable case feels completely comfortable in my hand love the colors 
neutral,i only use this mouse about hours week and it has already broke it won turn on or charge you get what you pay for 
positive,great sound and light carry we can move it around and perfect for the back patio we can use it and not worry about the kids splashing water from the water table small pool water hose or slip and slide
positive,came like this tried popping it back in but it keeps on popping back out wouldn recommend 
positive,okay so cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse my husband is the gamer can however let you know about my general usage opinion first off it pretty love the color and love that it lights up on the sides there is setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain ve been using it for days pretty consistently and haven needed to charge it there wasn any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used just plugged in the small usb and it immediately worked that all can say at this point since haven had it that long will update this review in few months and include any issues may experience and any new opinions develop 
positive,my sons love these gaming headphones the sound quality is great and they look really cool too 
positive,use this product for pc gaming it is great was expecting issues by now since it was so inexpensive but it holds up well do recommend this keyboard for any gamer that is looking to go wireless and on budget 
positive,ehh it ok good hold me over
positive,super cute but it is really slow 
positive,i ordered charge while back and was very happy decided to get another one for different place in my home after seeing charge was available and at the se price point as my older charge ordered it out of the box it has the same great jbl quality was very happy to hear jbl did away with the annoying start up and shut down tones bluetooth connection is faster and the sound is fuller than the charge we get more than advertised run time very well done jbl 
positive,everything went smoothly the mouse looks awesome and works perfect 
neutral,really nice for the price
positive,style good long battery lifespeed love mine 
neutral,small doesn respond well
positive,sounds lot better than wanderboom that gave away to my dad got this instead and think it way better 
positive,this mouse is of good quality am very satisfied
positive,i placed it under gentle stream of water and it continued playing 
positive,color looks exactly as advertised and the charging port and size are perfect love it so much definitely worth the money
positive,i was happy to get the gift from my sister sound quality was great when tried it out before putting it to full use on my patio wanted to fully charge the speaker guess what no usb charging cord in the packaging nor any set up documentation found some on line but it was quickly apparent that my usb cords for my iphone would not work to charge the device had to order what hopefully will fit replacement from amazon extremely disappointed with bothamazon and the seller 
positive,sound is great love the led lights matches perfect with my game room thanks 
positive,love it 
neutral,thinnest mouse have ever seen 
positive,this keyboard is great was using it so quickly just plugged in the usb dongle and it was ready to go the lights are so pretty and the board is so lightweight this is easily transportable it has switch which allows you to shut of the lights if you choose my daughter was so excited when she realized that besides the pc she could also use on her xbox it would actually be great if this could come with multiple dongles so it could be used on more than device at time however it so easy to switch that it really not such big deal to do it yourself it charges really easily too for the price this is good buy 
positive,the mouse is comfortable to move it goes to sleep while in zoom teams call however easily wakes up with one click 
positive,this is awesome didn know it lit up different colors was just in hurry online shopping glad got this works great
neutral,decent bass good battery life not quite as loud as was expecting but over all quality speaker just don make the same mistake did and get white one they get dirty easy 
positive,i very impressed with how crisp the mike us and how minimal the noise output is for people not wearing the headset 
negative,ctrl shift left doesn work have to use ctrl shift right it is not the end of the world but it is annoying depending on the game you ll play some key combinations may not work also tried to use this for flight simulations which needs lots of key combinations failed even within less than ft from directly visible usb dongle this product misses characters while typing sleep mode and battery life is good but overall regretting my decision to buy this product 
negative,i love how quiet it was without hearing clicking at every move but unfortunately it started stalling freezing and just unusable in less than month 
positive,excellent headphones for the price great noise cancellation couldn even hear my dog chewing up new pair of shoes right next to me while had them on 
positive,these are great headphones they are super comfy great for gaming and cancel noise very well
neutral,bought for laptop just poor performance of mouse 
positive,bought this for my kiddos laptop she likes the lights and the almost weightless feeling it was good buy for the price and works great so far 
positive,this is great keyboard and like it however do wish there were more light effects than featured the lights are as shown in the picture they can be set to stay solid color or to strobe on and off you can adjust the brightness of the lights as well as far as the lights what you see in the description picture is exactly what you get other than the lights you are able to hold down the function key and press other keys to control the volume of your computer and play skip forward skip backward and stop play buttons theres couple other hotkeys you can use but are useless to myself and likely everyone else under the age of 
positive,charged up quickly in little over an hour looks great feels great but the scrolling wheel does not work looking at it closely it looks like the wheel is slightly off center it spins freely like it isn connected to anything back it goes 
neutral,doesn hold charge very long hard to click use stopped working all together have gone back to wired mouse much easier to use 
positive,i purchased this for my son gaming computer he loves it thank you
positive,what great product bought these for my son year old birthday and he loved them 
positive,on the pricey side but well worth it for my needs it great for filling the backyard with tunes podcasts while gardening or playing with my two dogs pros loud clear sound simple operation excellent build quality available in variety of colors cons could use an eq in the app or even simple low mid hi curve control to optimize it for different listening environments can be powered on off remotely from app summary we were sufficiently impressed with the charge that we bought second unit for garage basement use 
neutral,my son wanted in headphones choose to order this when his playing with nintendo switch nobody can hear him 
positive,best portable speaker ever purchased from store not amazon but this speaker is perfectttt jbl is killin it because their bluetooth headphones have are amazing too 
neutral,stopped working few weeks after purchase 
positive,great product recommended 
negative,it used to be good until this morning that couldn use the roller since it broken it broke on its own because it bad quality
positive,this mouse is super clean looking and connects fast it not only recharges within hours but it lasts long time ve been using it pretty frequently for the past week and only charged it once it still going strong love how it lights up and it can be used on mac or windows computer very light and easy to transport as well 
neutral,cool
positive,i purchased this mouse because it was wireless and the white color with led colors were nice the mouse holds charge for quite while works great the colors are ok nothing to warrant complaint it was bargain and would buy again 
neutral,this is little larger than the charge has longer battery life gets little louder than the charge but sound quality is about the same 
positive,fits prefect in my hand and the lights are great to keep tack of the mouse in dark room 
positive,this is made with low quality the adapter for usb doesn work as in it doesn even fit into usb port tried multiple to make sure this was the common denominator the mouse comes apart too easily the battery life is poor do not waste your money buying 
neutral,these headphones worked for about week and then quit checked all the settings on my xbox and still could not get them to work not happy 
positive,it pink and super light love it ton
positive,speaker sounds realy good clear with good bass 
positive,this mouse is very light almost too light since you don place batteries inside ultimately that why returning bc need mouse that can pick up easily also the led lights don look like the picture 
neutral,very good quality sound 
neutral,i cannot get this mouse to work even when plug in with cord
neutral,it stopped working after falling on the floor 
positive,cute and comfy but the volume does not go up too high high enough for most gameplay but play games where need the extra volume at times
negative,i going back to basic and battery operated lost charge at inconvenient times then started being temperamental on taking charge now it won take charge at all worthless to me waste of time and money 
positive,good sound so far very happy with this purchase 
neutral,the headset was nice lookin but stopped working after days
neutral,i purchased this in february it began tracking poorly in july and stopped scrolling in august 
neutral,we bought the headphones for use with the xbox and the microphone doesn work could still hear noices outside of headphones wasn even compatible with any device all together the headphones just weren working at all 
neutral,expected better sound from the product 
neutral,this worked for few months had to charge it overnight week as work from home and used this mouse for my work laptop after several months it stopped holding charge and would have to be charged daily now it won charge or work super annoying because really need mouse and now have to order another one had hoped this would last lot longer than months but now putting plastic into the landfill and it sucks 
neutral,this is good unit nice bass good sound but had jbl charge three and do not like that cannot use the same charging wire for the amount of money that you charge for the gpo charge for it should come with its own charge wire should not have to go online and purchase charge wire separately or double usb cord let down
neutral,it is so slow and lags find better option
positive,for the price you can complain super low profile led lights works really well no lag 
neutral,this mouse did not work the wireless receiver did work so the mouse did not connect to my laptop 
neutral,don buy this bought it twice and it broke down quickly very cheap product
neutral,worked great for about month and then the button stopped clicking properly or at all 
positive,when first got the item the color looked off ordered the blue but fairly positive based on the images was sent mint green liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for bit because it was so quiet however after only week and half the mouse wheel stopped working could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so opened it to investigate and it looked like there was small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn work anymore liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the rgb lights it bothered me but that didn affect the function wish this had worked better 
positive,so far it works great hope it stays like that 
neutral,first you can either have the headset glowing or you can actually use the mic pick one you cant have both secondly maybe its just mine but my headset is completly lopsoded crocked however you want me to say it third due to it being uneven sound quality isnt great no noise cancelation and its not as loud as would like it last its uncomfortable period
neutral,very short charge life also keyboard was hard to use
neutral, outta 
positive,just what needed and like the colors real sleek in hand
neutral,very good product
neutral,no dislikes
positive,great little mouse fits nicely in my hand you can turn the led on or off click to wake from sleep quiet clicking like it

positive,works great
positive,i bought this mouse for my wife but loved it so much that had to get second for myself it has really great feel and it works really well
neutral,despite the description saying it was macbook compatible it wasn have the macbook air with the chip regardless it nice mouse and it quite as described and does work on pc was able to test it on my pc 
neutral,the seal was brocken already it was supposed to be used it looks really new
positive,cheap cheap cheap cheapquit working like day and now am outside of return window good thing it was cheap buyers beware spend little more 
neutral,this is the cheapest thing have ever seen the quality is horrible holding it in my hand feels like it weighs nothing it is extremely cheap the lights are neat tho they should be ashamed selling this for anymore then 
positive,mainly mouse youd keep at home on desk not really suited for travel battery life is great charged it once month ago and for being in highschool all of our work is on the chromebook and this mouse hasnt died yet
neutral,works well worth it
positive,fantastic
neutral,really liked the look feel quiet click but it broke on me after few days 
positive,got itand time and my grandson loves it
positive,exactly what my son was wanting and at great price and as usual very fast delivery
neutral,the scroller broke after weeks of intermittent use approximately hours per day days per week 
positive,great speaker
neutral,it joke we tried for long time to get the mouse to even work and it doesn even after trying the mouse on multiple surfaces and troubleshooting thinking it was our computer we plugged in different mouse and it worked fine requested return of the item and had to pay for the return shipping and print the label absolute joke don waste your time 
neutral,i ordered one to try out it kept disconnecting if didn press key for seconds won hold charge at all so requested replacement it came and same deal just disconnects middle of using it needless to say now have useless wireless keyboards in my house 
positive,i love these headphones noise cancelling is amazing especially for when your gaming no glitches so far with the sound quality would totally recommend these 
positive,batteries would be so much easier with the way the power runs out after charging by usb frustrating because if your in the middle of something have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use love the feel of it though and the cool lights 
neutral,it nice mouse
positive,sounds great the sound is well balanced the single speaker instead of stereo is not an issue at all great build quality also 
positive,great sound and easy to carry around 
positive,i ride my bike to work and next to busy traffic it sounds great at volume indoors its even better with crisp highs and really good lows
positive,my office desk has slide out tray for the keyboard and this keyboard is perfect for that because of its slim design there is no wasted space had to replace more expensive keyboard for that reason and actually like this one much better the only complaint have is that the caps lock key is apparently where my fingers and brain feel like the shift key should be hopefully will adjust to that 
positive,i expected more considering its the most expensive keyboard ve ever bought customer support is useless the lights were cool when it worked consistently another piece of chinese made garbage from amazon at least ve learned my lesson recently on buying stuff like this lost the value of year worth of prime from poorly made products like this oof it learning experience guess buy logitech or something reputable 
negative,my mouse has stop working already had the mouse for two months and already it has stop working this was waste of money 
neutral,its only been like month and it has short in it its been like this since got it but thought it would stop but it didnt 
negative,bought this at the end of september it about months now and for the past several weeks the keyboard hasn been working ve tried everything it lights up when click keys but it doesn type and then the rgb colors just go away it was constantly plugged in since the battery life was terrible but now it looks like wasted money and will need to go back to my old keyboard find different keyboard don buy this 
positive, this mouse is lightweight it charges fast by small cable which is included it does not take batteries it puts on light show of colors fun for adults or children this can easily be turned off by switch on the bottom of the mouse the mouse itself is easy to assemble there is small usb plug that clips to the bottom of the mouse for storage when you are not using it this plugs into your computers usb port when you do use it this is great mouse to use as backup the color is great also review title great spare mouse
positive,it slim not bulky works well with my laptop love the lights great buy
positive,straight out of the box it is sleek and feels good in my hand however it does not read on or off the mousepad very disappointed 
neutral,i like
neutral,see title junk feels poor in your hand if no star button would rate it disapointed
positive,my boys love to game on their computer xbox and nintendo switch this headset is great for all gaming experience great sound and microphone the only reason did not give it stars is the cord can get tangled easily and when that happens it doesn give the star experience have bought several of these though and will continue to get the same as they get worn out the price for the quality of the product is worth it 
positive,amazing product loved the sound and flexibility soft pads does not hurt your years very comfy and very satisfied 
positive,i liked using this mouse but it needed charged lot more than anticipated it looks good and worked good but overall was little too cheaply made and it didn last long it fell thanks to my small children and cracked right open only got to use it couple of months 
positive,at first thought it wasn going to be as good because of the price too cheap and honestly surprised the audio is pretty good better than what expected the cancelation noise is awesome can almost hear myself you can unmute and mute also lower and raise the volume which think it awesome overall better than excepted and the price is very good for what you get

neutral,barely had it months and the scroll wheel on top stopped working now it pretty much useless 
positive,the sound quality and bass is better than any bluetooth speaker have purchased before have had zero problems long battery life is key for bluetooth speaker it says hours on the box but felt like it went longer before finally had to charge glad spent little more for better quality speaker this was worth it 
negative,the charging cord is so short and flimsy it won stay connected to both pieces so it is difficult to get full charge the mouse does not hold charge after be left on the charger overnight it is dead within five minutes use 
positive, just love the colors it is comfortable on your wrist great size fits great in my slim laptop case 
negative,product does not work well don waste your money

neutral,it doesn work anymore after month when the return is no longer allowed then it stopped working 
neutral,easy to install and use 
negative,i bought these because play rpgs via discord and wanted better mic than my galaxy buds because sometimes they don pick up my voice from the very first night used this headset people said there was an echo and they could hear themselves on my mic it was quite distracting and ended up having to switch to my earbuds thought that was weird maybe just problem with discord but would try some solutions and see if could get them to work used them little since then and no one said anything but kept myself muted unless was actually speaking then my boyfriend complained about hearing youtube through the mic to the point where it was very loud for him when could barely hear the video myself wondered if it might be my macbook pro did some research to see if there was setting could change or anything else to fix the problem nothing did then thought about seeing if other people had had the same problem by checking the reviews after reading them convinced the headset has an insane amount of noise leakage and is just bad quality all around starting the process of returning them through amazon because don have any faith that the seller will respond or offer me any satisfaction bring on the cash offers but this review is going nowhere 
positive,love it such good sound and works everywhere
negative,i work from home and work hours day depending if do overtime or not so needed mouse because my wireless mouse of years was dying now got this mouse in hopes it would work great because of all the reviews the first day got this mouse it was very uncomfortable so right off the bat knew didn like flat mouses because it was cramping my hand second the cursor was glitching unfortunately cannot attach video because it would be on company property and don have personal computer ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other if you like mouses like this and can deal with the glitching then that fine but for me hated it very frustrating 
positive,good value for the looks good quiet buttons fancy light up feature no batteries to replace 
neutral,quality bass
positive,works great highly recommend this product nothing to dislike 
neutral,for the price you absolutely can beat these the brand name was very odd twist on more notable brand but very solid product 
negative,i ordered for work and for home they are great until died after months it indicated that it is charged but it does not function it might be bad switch they second died in less than months of use disposable batteries would be better for the environment than disposing of multiple rechargeable that stop working faster than battery runs out 
positive,i didn like the way the light shown thru the top like the plastic was super thin and semi transparent and it didn come thru evenly have been using it for while now and it sometimes gives me trouble have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes just unplug usb and plug back in fixes it still stars because at this price it great 
positive,it is comfortable product its price quality ratio is good think it is good product 
positive,like the feel and options in this mouse happy with purchase
positive,really love this very good product buy one or two 
neutral,this is broken within month 
positive,this was good mouse got as gift and really liked it until it didn work anymore after while it stoped working and looked at some other reviews that said they got defective one well guess did and they are kinda common to be defective so would only risk buying it if you want the mouse decent amount would say you re chance of it being broken is like also it only stops working after like days so you won know until then if you buy it also did like that they added usb adapter in the box use they adapter for something else now 
positive,great mic
neutral,i like the sound but so sick of carrying two or three speakers around for days with of music doesn matter what model ue might not sound as good but the battery life is much better jbl just give me product that delivers not holding on your support lines for let try this charge flip it megaboom box go ve spent way too much money with you done 
negative,i bought this for when started working from home after about or months the middle part no longer would scroll the page which is the reason bought it in the first place very disappointing since that the reason bought it in the first place 
positive,love the sound quality and ease of use 
positive,imho think these are the best headphones for the price they are extremely durable and can withstand many drops without problem my grandpa got them for me and love them they even come with usb cable for led lights and an adapter to be able to use the microphone and headphones at the same time the headphone mic quality is actually really good for any type of work or gaming so in my opinion this product has five star rating 
positive,great product
positive,this mouse is smooth to use and feels great in my hand recommend it 
neutral,battery dies way too fast 
positive,another solid product from jbl ve seen lot of reviews complain about the sound quality let be real for an item that can be fully submerged and still have the same great sound it did before it got wet its good bang for your buck it was more then loud enough for my back yard are you going feel like your at concert no are you going to be able to hear the song played while swimming yes 
positive,beautiful wireless mouse makes day in the office brighter
positive,solid battery life and great aesthetic worth every penny 
neutral,charged all night and only last few minutes this mouse has pretty design but it too thin to hold just asked for refund but not replaced 
positive,first the left mouse click is not sensitive enough requiring longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click annoying and betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder longer another less significant annoyance make sure you don turn on the light feature it looks cool but the thing acts like lava light night light continually changing colors of light even when not in use even with the computer off which will run down the battery like the rechargeable feature but will be looking for another mouse 
neutral,good mic qualitypretty pink colorused by year old girl
neutral,i ve had several of these headsets over the years good product used daily 
positive,just bought this mouse and was really excited to use it but even after charging for multiple hours the mouse will turn on briefly and then immediately stop functioning just goes to show that items this cheap often are too good to be true save your money and buy better mouse

neutral,quit working after weeks of use
positive,love this mouse
neutral,i seen in the description that it said it would work for xbox one went no further after receiving the head phones we noticed it did not work for xbox one so opened the instructions and there we seen that an adapter is needed for xbox one and it is dont buy these for xbox as between this and the adapter you will spend almost 
neutral,when bought this mouse loved it it took me few tries to get it paired right but it is game changer for my laptop the rechargeable battery life on it is great found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly that it was time to charge it purchased it late september and at the end of april my roller has stopped working randomly it worked and then went to use it an hour later and it no longer does the scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop disappointed 
neutral,i was enjoying the mouse but after days it malfunctioned and the rotary portion did not work 
positive,loved the color and the slimness of it charging chord came looking like dog chewed on it 
positive,when ordered my keyboard for my boyfriend the charging piece wasn in the box so messaged customer service and they sent me new one within couple days once used the keyboard it was nice quality the keys were smooth and satisfying to press it connected very easily to the pc definitely if you want keyboard buy this

neutral,very nice color and it shiny too 
neutral,i got the product and tried to use it plugged it into the usb slot of my ps the light went on and turned the mute off and volume up the headset does not work at all can hear people talking from my television but not in the headset or the headset is not being picked up by the game or working strongly do not recommend as it doesn work

neutral,didn work after days
neutral,this headset works really well
positive,the mouse worked well for day but nowhere cursor is non responsive checked to make sure it was fully charged did some troubleshooting and moved the usb to multiple ports on the laptop nothing worked guessing just received dud or maybe the mouse just isn compatible with my laptop ve used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop this is the first time ve ever had an issue make sure you try the mouse out right away after charging upon receiving it incase it doesn work and needs to be returned

neutral,ohhhhhh love this keyboard in every way don game but do work at night and can see all the keys 
positive,if you need mouse just for making your life easier while working with spread sheets or any other microsoft office tool this is perfect not quite sure how comfortable this would be for gaming though 
positive,it is amazing wanted to wait days for any weird stuff or just sign of cheap plastic but no it passes the test want to congratulate them for their amazing microphone quality too 
positive,i love the sound quality and the noise cancelation of the headset and the overall quality of the headset like for the price it is it is extremely worth it
neutral,it does not light up
neutral,just quick note linux compatible out of the box nice mouse
neutral,very glitch curser tracking is not smooth at all silent buttons are almost too sensitive and frequently click when not meaning to do so threw out this item after only days 
positive,great gaming headphones
neutral,good headset would bye again
positive,i love this mouse got the teal and used it for the first time today in love 
positive,great sound 
positive,microphone doesn work at all doesn even show up in my ability to locate and change settings on devices to use the microphone as well as the switch to mute the mic doesn work because my computer can only use the mic from the computer this headset is real let down just go back to using my bluetooth headset that more comfortable and can walk around in but without mic on it if required to be at the computer to use the mic anyway 
neutral,nice color big and comfortable but doesn feel heavy only dislike is that the led lights don work unless you use the usb
neutral,it is good mic
neutral,i just am having trouble hooking it up to my xbox controller
neutral,stopped working after months sound constantly goes in and out but was solid for the st months also very long inch wire which is very unnecessary and gets in the way bucks for reason
positive,very easy to use and efficient 
neutral,pros surprisingly the battery charge lasts me looooong time think it lasted me month on one charge one of the cheapest in the market cons the first one got didn work the replacement one worked but sometimes the scroll is backwards 
positive,like design not function frustrating
positive, great for the price very small but fits hand perfectly
positive,the sound quality is very good and the speaker is portable really like that bought this for my husband on father day 
positive,i can hear every footstep on any game play great product 
neutral,the only problem had with this item is that it doesn charge 
neutral,this item came broken we tried charging it over night but it never worked had to return it
neutral,my husband bought of these in different colors for our children for school last month yesterday was the first day for our youngest the mouse did great no problem the second was dead since our daughter likes colors so we placed it on the charger last night and it still charging unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge no charge at all so now have to explain to my yr old that the company gave her broken mouse and try to find way to to get it work with her device while always charging should of just went to target 
neutral,lasted whole weeks before it quit working started acting up and finally just quit would not recommend
neutral,it exactly as bad as should have expected for the price ve had it for days and it will randomly stop working have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again the plastic it made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture honestly should have spent few more bucks and bought something better 
neutral,wheel stopped working after return period no mistreatment 
positive,i like that it is excellent to use it 
positive,works great for in game chatting on my ps love it 
positive,it works great love it my son uses it aswell for roblox
neutral,there was very good audio quality 
positive,i was little apprehensive about buying this keyboard at first because didn want anything shaped too gamey or angular guess you could say but was too impatient to wait another hours for different style to ship out so jumped on this one and don even notice the shape anymore at all love this keyboard the keys are not completely silent but almost the perfect amount of soft clickiness just enough to let you know you ve hit key the colors are vibrant and so fun even in broad daylight so far battery life is great love that you can charge and still use it at the same time some won allow this the only thing ll have to get used to is the enter return key is about an inch farther to the right than used to but that matters less to me every day very happy 
neutral,really cute mouse but only used it once and now it wont even turn on 
neutral,i got defective speaker that would not charge and the replacement dynamics will take more than month it feels like bought procedure to ship back speaker wait for an evaluation from the factory and then in about month maybe get replacement it might not happen often but it has happened to me and am very frustrated with the way things are handled got the new speaker from jbl month later same problem the thing just won charge never even put it to use under humid conditions this product is really bad while the other models of jbl speakers work great 
positive,great speaker at reasonable price this is the second one bought 
neutral,don know about battery have not had it long 
positive,love love love 
positive,works great
neutral,all was lookin 
positive,love it and the colors 
positive,i got this mouse on thursday night only charged it for less than minutes not full charge and have been using it for days in row on the red light mode only thought it would run out of power in day or two but is still working nicely the mouse feels comfortable under my palm not too big or too small was ready to be disappointed for the price vs quality but so far so good 
positive,of left unattended for while sleep mode works fantastic also great for gaming 
neutral,loved this mouse until it stopped working several months after purchase it will no longer charge and cannot use it very disappointed 
neutral,easy to use
neutral,it rechargeable and the battery lasts quite some time of course always turn it off once done using it but no more batteries comes with the charger as well what more could you ask for 
neutral,the item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did had to turn it off and then on again and then after days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely 
positive,great compact keyboard with key easy to type on not noisy plug play setup love the colors and breathing effect is very calming no issues for me 
positive,works as described nice design and functionality highly recommend 
neutral,white button spin wheel broke months later too late to return 
positive,great all around speaker ve use it for quite some time now and still love it great sound durable and connects easily
positive,i liked the fact it was slim and liked the lights on it 
neutral,ok
neutral,works just fine 
positive,very happy with this bluetooth speaker sounds great and easy to carry around seems to have bit more bass sound than some other brands 
negative,ok so am not super tech person and am not sure if this is fixable problem or not but only one side of the headphones work that was the whole reason on buying another pair of headphones because my first pair of different brand started to break and lose hearing in one side just opened mine and yet it has the same problem other than that they seem great just wished mine worked know 
positive,perfect
positive,works as claimed lights are pretty battery keeps it charged for several days do not use it for gaming so don know how it would perform for me and my web searches it works great and performs as expected would buy it again 
negative,they are good but hate that have to have both usb and aux connected 
positive,i play pc and xbox so got this mic for gaming on both or one of them didnt really care but tried it on the pc first and it wasn the best sound quality and was trying to chat with people but that didn go well so tried on the xbox hoping it would work better on there but nope it didn so now not getting this mic again cuz it was trash maybe got bad one idk so got one from walmart that work really good for everything need it for amd it was like 
positive,this is nice sleek little mouse very pleased with the size and the connection range was looking for one that wasn too clunky but still looked decent this definitely fits the bill all the awesome colors is just plus for my own personal amusement also if you don want the lights all the time there is setting for that too good little mouse for the price 
positive,awesome little speaker with loud sound perfect for travel it charge last very long time 
neutral,the reliable range is less than inches at feet you usually have to click repeatedly control of the moving arrow was sporadic thought something was wrong with my computer until bought new mouse which works fine 
negative,mouse is very pretty aesthetics of it is nice it handles well but it broke within couple days of getting it the button stuck wouldn click anymore unfortunately liked it so well this was the second one that ordered and the first one that ordered the rollerball stopped working but it too late to return that one so now have two broken ones the lights on at really cool the battery lasts really long time in between charging but now have two of them that have broken and six week think
neutral,it does it job for the price if you can spend little extra for something better go for it but if need strapped for cash it ll do 
positive,i bought refurbished one but it looked brand new and untouched so saved few bucks and that was good the green color is cool much cooler than black which was my second more expensive choice it connected immediately almost to my ipad iphone macbook the sound is great it very loud but don play it that loud yet bought it to use outdoors for music so expect it will work well paired with an iphone it simple compact device but it delivers great sound could not be happier and it waterproof which hope never to test but it nice to know because it will be outside and might get left outdoors overnight on occasion battery life seems fine so far but have only used it for few hours time will tell on that one 
positive,great sound great price 
positive,the only thing dont particularly like is that it feels cheaply made and isnt the snuggest fit but it works wonderfully in all other regards 
positive,love it it fits my hand just right only issue is that it came in another language 
positive,the wireless connection works great and mouse looks sleek and cool especially for the price 
neutral,made very cheap broke the second it was too late to return it guess got what paid for save your money and buy better quality mouse 
positive,good booming sound love it and the fact can charge my phone too 
neutral,computer
positive,just wish it came with all the fixing but still works well 
positive,great sound system that easily connects to bluetooth use this for outdoor workouts and it total hit 
positive,great sound easy to connect and long lasting battery 
positive,works great sounds great 
positive,i love the sound quality of this speaker was worried it wouldn sound good after reading several reviews about sound quality being just okay disagree the sound and bass this thing has is incredible my only suggestion would be to have more colors more feminine colors specifically one in darker shade of teal otherwise no complaints recommend this speaker to anyone 
positive,just received it yesterday but have already been using it to listen to music out in the patio the music is so crisp still need to adjust the settings on my phone to make sure get my moneys worth with quality have yet to test the range but was about away with wall in between and music was still going 
neutral,the product malfunctioned after the first couple of weeks one of the connections stopped working 
positive,i loving this wireless keyboard awesome battery life and the keyboard rat are rechargeable excellent quality and price definitely recommend this product 
positive,the click isn loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder the battery doesn last near long enough not even whole day even when you don have the lights on it does feel nice in the hand it does track well but would say mouse pad isn optional with this one 
positive,awesome sound and bass 
positive,for the price it very good quality its not too heavy but not so light that it feels cheap like the cord length and the cushions feel good on my ears 
positive,we went on long vacation so worked part of the time having meetings in the car the people on the other end were able to hear me and not background noise from the road even in torrential rain was also able to hear them clearly it was exactly what hoped for 
neutral,i bought this for working at home general use was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when didn have any works great for general use and battery lasts while but haven done any button mashing games with it my only complaint is the usb remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage you have to dig with your nail to remove it small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse 
positive,bought this because it was suggested for its comfort it said people with larger heads could wear it without the infamous head pinch was snug fit for me felt the pinch and the ear cups were too small was going to disregard it since it was fairly cheap but then tested it out one of the headphones didn work and yeah made sure it wasn on mono the the and were on and balanced returned 
positive,great product
neutral,lightweight wireless keyboard that lives up to its description 
neutral,does it job looks pretty and is rechargeable
neutral,works well
neutral,this mouse is terrible bought it for work its not like needed anything super advanced just something that would give me little more space than the touchpad this mouse skips when you move it and if you want to click something you have to hit the button or times it also very uncomfortable in the hand 
positive,i hated using this mouse it was beautiful and matched the color of my laptop perfectly but couldn get the cursor to move smoothly adjusted the setting on my laptop but ultimately ended up getting different mouse which worked perfectly 
negative,this gaming headset does not light up when you play this only lights up when plugged in to the usb for charging only initially bought it because thought the led would show when gaming which is the main purpose but was wrong plus the cables are way to short to have it plugged in and the surround system is bad wouldn recommend buying this cheap mic 
positive,the sound is fantastic control buttons are convenient and work easily with little effort love that there were so many colors to choose from 
neutral,the mouse only worked if it was plugged in not at all wireless like it says
positive,the sound quality is amazing not to mention the great design all around good headset 
neutral,my sister and both have these speakers and we think they are great we live in the country so radio is difficult we bluetooth online music 
positive,i use this mouse for basic tasks no gaming but like the fact that is rechargeable and seems to hold the charge long enough also like the silent mode so can work at night on bed without disturbing my wife 
positive,amazing speaker own jbl and got my dad jbl no issues pairing them together bluetooth works like charm and multi phone support jbl have always produced quality speakers 
positive,the mouse hooks up easily and does what it advertised to do hassle free 
positive,amazing speaker with even better connectivity only complaint is sound is not too crisp or loud overall amazing speaker and would recommend to buy 
negative,so sad been using for months only and the scroll wheel broke already bye bye scrolling feature kind of turn off to use it now that its broken
negative,i ve been pc gaming since the not sure what makes this gaming keyboard there aren any special keys for hot binding the back lit keys look cool but are completely useless if you know how to type ll keep my opinion on pc gamers who don know the keyboard layout to myself so far haven had an issue with key lag or battery life but just got it this week did make sure it was fully charged before used it otherwise it just basic wireless keyboard it not fancy or special so far it done what ve needed it to do
positive,great sound quality
positive,got this mouse for my desktop setup which mainly use for office purposes and it has been working great it replaced cheaper version than this one that got at below of which did not expect much but got me going for years don think would recommend for gaming since is little on the small side and somewhat flat but who knows is it very responsive thought and looks nice with the changing colors 
neutral,stopped working nd north of work
neutral,loved at first but ve only used handful of times and the middle rolling part broke so can scroll 
neutral,i like the overall design the slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive where struggling with this mouse is that as trying to work there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen also trying to hold and highlight group of text for some reason it loses connection what ve ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my shift arrow keys to highlight the text that need for general web browsing this mouse isn bad for productivity it not really working for me and going to go back to my wired mouse 
positive,ive been looking for nice keyboard for my custom built gaming school home use pc and am more than pleased with this keyboard input lag is comparable to my logitech wired keyboard and ive played titanfall with it and love it battery life seems great as ive used this product all night and its still going strong the keys are great not quite as ratifying as clicky mechanical keyboard but very close the backlighting is beautiful the colors are clear and sharp but not overwhelmingly bright the shape key travel and spacing make this keyboard an absolute pleasure to work play with its lightweight but sturdy as you would actually have to put alot of force into bending or twisting the board to hurt it personally im certain that it would take alot of high drops onto concrete to actually hurt this thing all in all great product for great price and stoked to have it ive actually typed this review with the keyboard 
positive,i am not very hard on this mouse use it to work from home but this morning after only using for months the wheel of the mouse broke not sure what happened as am very gentle on the mouse it nice design and love the lights and the fact that it rechargeable but it is pretty cheap and can break easily so keep that in mind when purchasing 
neutral,quit working within months of use
positive,works great
positive,best speaker ever
negative,of course weeks after return window closes the mouse stops working slow movement and doesn respond to commands waste of plastic update seller offered to make this right awaiting final resolution
negative,i returned the jbl charge for two reason first to my ears the sound has too much bottom music sounds muddy and the higher end is lost due to too much bass unfortunately there no way to adjust the bass and treble what you hear is what you re stuck with the second reason for my return is the awful electronic sound effects that play automatically when you turn the device on or off regardless of your streaming volume these sound effects are loud and completely unnecessary 
neutral,mouse stop working after couple of days feel cheap got what paid for always felt like was holding the wrong end of the mouse 
positive,just like the title says died out of nowhere days after the return window and warranty were up tired it on two pcs and one laptop it still lights up but won connect junk 
neutral,very slick 
positive,my son loved this headset 
negative,the thing is just laggy and terrible and you stop using it because it so frustrating junk 
positive,so bought two different mouse to use one for my laptop and one for my pc the originally bought this one for my desktop to match my rgb but enjoy using it with my laptop much better it is the perfect size for my hand you cannot go wrong at this price for what you get enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel 
positive,i bought this for gift when looked at it decided to buy one for myself love that it is rechargable and usb cable is included great tech style 
positive,my son loves these he said they are very nice and comfortable the sound is great he would give them stars 
positive,great product 
positive,the mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand the clicking is quiet the only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so have to keep it plugged in which defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse 
positive,decent speaker nothing revelatory but the form factor is great it gets the noise out there effectively pros battery life feels like it infinite bluetooth connectivity is the best ve ever experienced handsome unit cons thuddy sound but some of that is bluetooth some of that is streaming some of that is the fact that it not very big overall effectively fills the sonic gap between my home speakers and my laptop which is what it was meant for 
positive,i bought this for my year old for gaming he says it is comfortable and has good sound quality no complaints serves its purpose good purchase for the price 
positive,i have bought several of these since this first one they work amazing have had no issues and recommend this seller and mouse brand alot the price is so good 
positive,it pretty mouse just some notes plastic bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic it fine just an aesthetic thing mouse wheel bit noisy now after some use squeeks and screetches some when scrolling battery life is fine glad can use it when charging sensitivity is off cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out thought this was battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes overall it fine but shouldve just bought something bit sturdier even if it was pricier gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth 
positive,these headphones are very high quality for low price very sturdy and don feel cheap they hold onto your head very snug and don slip like alot of other headsets the sound quality is better than some high end headsets ve used and they cancel noise outside of the headset very well the cord is also very long so you re not restricted on how much you can move with them on as it is wired headset 
positive,my teenage son loved this 
neutral,edit if you amplify the sound using rd party software this addresses the issue the headset is good for its price the headset mic is barely audible when connected to pc have tried updating the driver disabling other devices following the cookie cutter instructions in the manual and nothing has improved the mic situation if you read the other responses to the first question for this product you will see others have also had mic problems this headset is false marketing and criminal the mic basically does not work additionally the usb light up is ridiculous and an absolute waste of space initially thought it served as an audio usb connection but this is not the case the sound quality is not bad and they are comfortable but the whole point for me was to buy headset with mic am highly disappointed
