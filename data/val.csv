neutral,the product is as shown in the picture
negative,i have had this mouse for while and have barely used it because the lag is so bad so so so so so bad it doesn follow it so slow it infuriating do graphic work and cannot have mouse that doesn act in real time do not recommend 
positive,my gbaby love them
positive,pros everything about this keyboard is really good the keys are super quiet like advertised my pc gaming setup is right next to our bed so if play at night when my wife is sleeping it does not wake her up because how silent the keys are the rgb light brightness controls are awesome too again allows me to keep the keyboard bright enough to see in dark without blinding me or my wife while she sleeps if game at night the color tones of the rgb lights are very nice pleasing to look at cons the keys feel sticky with every press feels as if there was sticky substance holding down the keys for fraction of second when depressed but only little not too big of deal but some gamers might find this very annoying there are only two rgb light options to choose from breathing effect and constant back lite would be nice if there were more lighting effect options 
neutral,mouse does not hold charge 
positive, this headset is perfect for gaming love how cheap it is and it still really nice quality ve had the bengoo mic for about years and it been working like charm highly recommended you get this out of

neutral,very nice keyboard bright but not too bright kind wish the sleep mode did turn on so quickly
positive,it is sleek and like the fact that can charge it on my computer it does light up and it works great after sitting for while the mouse needs to wake up by pressing the right click 
positive,i love it
positive,i wanted silent or soft clicks and that what got the led light were bonus for me 
positive,bought this for my husband he was very pleased with it works just fine and comes as described 
positive,i do like the pretty lights and how you can easily use this keyboard in dark room otoh those pretty lights burn the batteries quite quickly so it isn really wireless keyboard it best to keep it plugged in and charging most of the time but that true of basically all wireless lighted keyboards the big problem had was that it just never got along with my computer mac running big sur several times day would have to unplug the wireless dongle shut off the keyboard and then plug in and power up again even then sometimes had to restart the computer after week or so of that gave up and returned the keyboard 
positive,it so quiet and easy on my hands when making art on my laptop this mouse has smooth cursor movement and is super easy to charge no more batteries 
positive,great value comfortable and stylish little mouse 
positive,worked great for months then deader than hammer will not charge tried everything resets cables everything buyer beware 
neutral,just go to your local department store when opened the package and inspected the mouse it had obvious scratches and looked like there was some wear on the bottom it works and gets the job done bought this mouse because was tired of buying batteries for another wireless mouse the mouse will not work when you have it plugged into the computer to charge 
positive,it does everything ordered it to do for good price rechargeability is huge plus to me for wireless mouse the clicks are satisfying and it feels nice to hold my only gripe is that the lights on it are bit weak but honestly don care about that in the slightest and that not why bought it so it not big deal 
neutral,this mouse is rechargeable which is great except that it doesn hold charge charged it all night and the next day it died after using it for minutes would not recommend this item and will go back to wireless mouse that uses batteries 
negative,i ve only had this for few months now and it is completely broken the scroll feature lost its traction and no longer works the battery life wasn great and it never worked flawlessly need new mouse now 
neutral,bbbsbdv
positive,works well very responsive
neutral,no computer mouse was amazing
positive,i like this mouse the light colors constantly scroll through rainbow and aren static on just one color my office is in my bedroom and if leave the mouse on it makes great nightlight not too bright but just light enough to find my way around if wake up during the night especially love the fact that it rechargeable and that haven had to put any batteries in it since bought it several months ago the thing don like is that it has tendency to do its own thing sometimes if working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me flat and completely still not rolling backwards or moving at all the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at diagonal stuttering its way up and across the screen at other times will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw line and the cursor will suddenly jump to completely different part of the screen or it will hiccup and lose the hold on what was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble sometimes quite sharply kind of like trying to draw straight line in the car when the tire hits pothole it good little mouse and aside from the spastic glitches pleased with it but am getting tired of not having full control right when need it most may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer

positive,my son loves this headset he can hear me talking to him so no disruptions to his game sound quality is great but don have to hear the gameplay

positive,i love the feel and look of it
negative,i didn even notice until started typing on it but the forward slash key is to the left of the enter key instead of above so always accidentally hit it instead of the enter key nothing bad to say about the keyboard otherwise just strange design ll probably hang onto it as backup but the weird key placement is dealbreaker for me 
positive,great sound quality
positive,i got them for my son as birthday present so far he been really enjoying them he loves that they light up he thought it so cool 
positive,love everything about it 
positive,just adquiere this speaker and really amazed by the sound quality and volume of this small device an enthusiast of sound and music and have years of experience listening and installing different sound sources either car audio and home can say that for sure that bigger equipment sound better but for the size of this can be more happy good bass reproduction 
positive,outstanding customer service had question and received an immediate response and resolution love this mouse and would recommend it to others 
positive,this headset is beautiful slick and comfortable it does its job with beautiful sound and quality gaming 
negative,i had no issues with the mouse but dropped it from not even ft from the ground on accident of course and the spin wheel and the left clicker broke ve ordered another one and hope it lasts longer than this one did 
neutral,i had the mouse working for one day then could not use it any further the mouse pointer had mind of it own and would take over it own movement what disappointment was hoping not to go back to battery operated mouse say do not buy this product 
neutral,like being able to keep phone charge while using speaker
positive,i purchased this for my desk at work it fantastic it was easy to get up and running and it was just wonderful eliminating the cords that were all over my desk great product

positive,received headset plugged it in light came on but no sound would come through the ear pieces and mic didn work either basically just bought light to wear on my head for completely useless gave stars because atleast the light worked and the headset looks nice other then that it junk update was contacted by company and sent new headset which works perfect so gave star review now because headset has good sound quality it light weight and comfortable to wear for hours at time also added bonus is that the cord is decent length so it doesn limit you on movement 
positive,works well keys light up very nicely
positive,quite cute and very portable
positive,so really like these head phones travel alot and they are useful on my switch and my phone my tv still has headphone jack so can use it there too and then gaming on the computer too it wonderful headphones need to be made like this ve fallen asleep with them on and they have not been damaged o
positive,works well he loves the lights 
negative,it was good mouse while it lasted but died on me suddenly months after purchasing purchased and died 
positive,i purchased the jbl charge because of reviews had also purchased ue megaboom not the newer megaboom the two were equally priced so it came down to sound and features the jbl allows for charging device and for using plug in direct jack instead of bluetooth thought those were more important when ordered it until listened to them side by side had listeners and switched back and forth between them using same songs the other listeners liked the megaboom better but couldn identify why found the megaboom to have tighter bass and much better transparent mids and highs the charge sounded muddy in lows mids highs in comparison alone it can sound okay as long as you don have competitive reference sound quality beat out battery charging and the aux input 
positive,i really like this mouse it works great and is really cool looking love the alternating color lights around it and since it rechargeable you don have to worry about short battery life work on my computer hours week and find only need to charge it every weeks so periodically just plug it into my laptop when go to sleep so it is always good to go 
positive,from the several bluetooth speakers ve owned for nearly years this significantly has the clearest and best quality sound of them all notice that percussion is distinctively clearer from any bluetooth speaker ve heard as well jbl always delivers top notch durable product 
neutral,does not actually work with anything remotely resembling modern pc it still has auto jacks
neutral,i bought this on october and it stopped working on april it started acting up on the th where the responsiveness was sketchy charged it that night and the next day it didn power up 
neutral,this broke after weeks poorly put together 
positive,the color wasn like the photo it bit darker than what was expecting see photo for reference did love that the mouse came with usb to usb adapter the part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was stuck so had to use excessive force to remove it only other thing could change is the led colors it goes through series of colors but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be 
negative,i love this mouse it very smooth if had one complaint it would be that it will be dead in the morning if you don plug it up before you leave work but sometimes just forget to plug it up when leave so that my fault 
neutral,my mic stopped
neutral,it just wasn worth the money
neutral,this does not go loud at all was lil bummed 
positive,it does what it supposed to do works as wireless mouse beautiful color and works like charm 
positive,it was nice quiet mouse but about months in ve had issues charging with different and the original charging cord the charge does not last very long either really wanted to like this but will be getting new mouse only use this for work as work remote 
neutral,stopped working after months
negative,ordered this mouse in mid may in june it started acting bit off and could only use it turned on to one certain position yesterday august th the roller ball on top stopped working and now can scroll screens without using the sidebar very disappointed in how quickly this mouse stopped working my grandmother always said you get what you pay for and in this instance she was correct 
neutral,haven really used it much yet 
positive,no problems and work great
neutral,i don use this every day it less than two years old and already time for replacement the wire casing at the connection point is cracked and internal wires are exposed works great but should have lasted longer 
positive,overall great keyboard and rechargeable too the computer doesnt give you any warning whatsoever when the battery is low or dead so it might cut out mid use similarly the battery life isn stellar but that to be expected of light up keyboard overall good value at its price point 
negative,the scroller broke within week and the material looked greasy and worn after about week of very limited use 
neutral,good

neutral,i ve had this mouse for months and the wheel broke it the second mouse ve gotten like it and that other mouse wheel broke it much be cheap plastic it looks nice felt nice but not worth it when you have to buy one every months
neutral,we got this mouse for my teenage daughter and at first it worked great she only had it for weeks and it stopped working 
positive,has nice feel to it very smooth and responsive like the changing lights around the edge very colorful 
positive,i liked everything about this mouse was working great the couple of times week that used it then one day the scroll wheel stopped working completely no it not dirty there is no resistance it feels like it is free wheeling in there no explanation past return period

neutral,i brought it as gift it light up bluelight weight on the earsgreat sound
positive,love this mouse it has sleek design and works wonderful love the quietness and the perfect fit for my small hands 
positive,i was surprised at the quality of the headset the sound coming from the as well as the microphone are good quality wouldn say they are noise cancelling as could still hear people talking that are sitting next to me but these were not purchased for noise cancelling the sound is very good and they are comfortable didn think they were that heavy for their size 
positive,sounds are good from the head phones in line mic controls work well for mute unmute clear mic transmission too it new so can comment on longevity not overly expensive so it will be easy to replace if needed 
neutral,like
neutral,good product
neutral,mouse doesn slide easily sticks and on both my desk surface and my mouse pad you have to click very hard to make selection and the scroll bar is not consistent in speed wouldn purchase this product

neutral,product sound quality diminished months after purchase purchased march sound is now inaudible 
negative,i bought the wrong mouse to my computer it isn smooth and hard to control mouse on screen computer 
neutral,was little disappointed that there was no way to keep the lights on longer seconds just isn long enough for me give us the option to be able to keep the lights on all the time it just looks better also the lights aren very bright other than that its nice keyboard but not sure if ill be keeping it 
positive,i use it for every day work it great
neutral,this mouse only worked for one charging when charged it the second time everything works backwards want to go left it goes right your want it to go up it goes down don recommend this item they say you can return it 
neutral,worked great for month then the center button stopped working 
neutral,it quit working after weeks
neutral,this mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box it will move the cursor around and scroll but it will not click on anything right or left click ridiculous want to return it but the hassle of dealing with it isn worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with should have known to go for more expensive and reputable brand like logitech 
neutral,worked fine for what was needed fell off of the table one time and broke in half wouldn purchase again for my disabled mother 
neutral,these work soo well they are noise canceling too
neutral,could use an instruction sheet also what is the expected battery life on single charge

neutral, the item buy is broken look at this
positive, it an excellent product if you re looking for wireless mouse good price and with high load durability that correct use it for work in arcgis excellent service
positive,i like the color and the changing light the sleep mode is nice and saves battery life when you are not moving the mouse 
positive,this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used the flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use the colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive if you plan to use it with desktop computer be aware that the charging cord is very short so using the mouse while charging may be problem use it with laptop where this is not an obstacle the mouse appears very well made and sturdy 
positive,it was cheap and the lights are fun but it was cheap and doesn work great squeaky wheel as you re scrolling sometimes it doesn track well so that annoying but it gets the job done if your patient select different one 
positive,this speaker sounds better than my surround sound it has very long battery life use mine few times week and it sounds great no matter how loud have it my iphone connects faster to the bluetooth in this speaker than in my car and have car so it pretty up to date say would buy another one but one is plenty for my needs also it such good quality that don think ll need to buy another one anytime soon however will recommend this speaker to everyone 
neutral,bought this for my daughter for christmas for wireless and rechargeable mouse it sure didn get the memo it refuses to work without being plugged in we ve let it charge over night and everything would not recommend 
neutral,i like everything about them
positive,so far so good and looks cool with the led lights 
neutral,right out of the box the mouse never worked the buttons activate but the mouse never moved the cursor junk 
positive,when bought it expecting it to last more than month then last week noticed something wasn right sure enough the end oof the wire that plugs into the pc was breaking and really was happy with it at first not having to buy batteries for it 
neutral,the controller needs to be close to the ps because of the short length of the cable can even adjust the length of it sos have to play extremely close to the tv and ps and it uncomfortable to hold 
neutral,i bought by keyboard in had no issues until of the keys started getting stuck after heavy use about hours per day for year contacted customer service since it was under warranty and was sent brand new keyboard instantly without an exchange would strongly recommend this company and their products
neutral,i had to get another mouse this wouldn respond to clicks or scrolling about of the time even when got the mousepad that improves mouse functioning 
positive,very happy wireless receiver plugged straight into the usb port on the ps and works wonderfully very happy
neutral,real good and the charge last lot 
neutral,bought one and liked it bought another for stereo sound the second came factory refurbished no notice or mentioning on the amazon page about refurb believed was buying new not cool at least let the consumer choose weather or not to pay full price for refurb
positive,my granddaughter and picked this out for her th birthday she wanted simple great sound to use at college and didn want to be afraid to take it to beach this speaker provides all of that bluetooth pairing of her iphone with the speaker was simple and quick the speaker sound is incredible and doesn disappoint even when the volume is at the highest level already took the speaker to the beach without worry about water or sand there is charging port on the speaker to charge cell phone one comment on color the color pink comes in many shades and we weren too sure where this pink would land on the spectrum however the color is beautiful it soft shade kind of powder pink and even nicer than its picture 
neutral,worked for months then quit working
positive,perfect for starting out in gaming
positive,great headphones to play and talk to other players while playing video games 
positive,comfortable and sleek great for traveling love the colors running around it 
neutral,works sometimes very unreliable waited too long to return due to trying different things so that on me had to purchase different keyboard 
neutral,it is not response at all it is very jerky and doesn react for several seconds have used several cordless mice before but this gets the thumbs down 
positive,perfect for kids 
neutral,microphone required db to be increased and barely picked up voicing the constant static made my friends go nuts
positive,love it love the sound quality bass is amazing lasts all day bring it all around the house with me and the bluetooth connection reaches very far further than any other speaker ve had tbh absolutely worth the 
neutral,this is the second time have ordered this mouse actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and have to order new one so for that reason am only going to give you two stars ordered this particular mouse only two months ago and it already broken should get my money back 
neutral,the mic doesn work 
positive,sound quality is perfect noise cancellation is ok but didn buy them for that so don mind very clear microphone when gaming 
negative,no speaker better
neutral,i really liked the lights on the headset
positive,the only thing don like about this keyboard is that there faint humming sound when the backlights come on other than that it great sturdy wireless keyboard 
positive,super smooth operation and super quiet excellent battery life was very pleasantly surprised would not hesitate to purchase second one or even recommend to someone great price 
negative,this is good looking keyboard the rainbow colors you see are all you can get so no selection of one color is available although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice not critical issue as said it nice looking keyboard but functionally there are couple of issues that are immediately apparent first the enter key as in the picture attached has notch in it that is shared with the key am constantly hitting the and enter resulting in failed passwords and clutters chat messages so at minimum it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone another issue seems to be battery life instructions indicate hours to charge can accept that what can accept is the life of the battery after in the short time have had this keyboard it has died on my twice within day of getting full charge so sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life so now am keeping it wired with the provided cable because cannot be without keyboard when it dies and plugging it into power source is not enough once the battery is dead it will not power up until it has gotten enough of charge to respond but connected to the pc via usb cable makes it online instantly overall poor technical design my only other complaint and it could just be me adapting from laptop keyboards to mechanical desktop keyboard again but typing on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy but while writing this review took moment to look closer the keys on this keyboard are probably good smaller surface area than either laptop typically use this adds to the closeness of the keys and why am constantly off key here and there typing as normally do by feel alone square key up from the base versus the pyramidal shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable this is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back 
neutral,i know it lame but don like that it looks like it lights up in multi color but it doesn it red when it on and blue when it charging kind of bummer
positive,the cool features for gaming notwithstanding multi colored back light keys that can breathe or rotate this is an excellent all around multi function keyboard for general pc workload including function buttons that allow dimming brightness volume control etc keys are responsive and charge lasts about hours of gaming depending on usage and how bright the settings of the back lighting for the keys are set plus the customer service at klim is top notch highly recommended you will not be disappointed 
neutral,the scroll wheel doesn work
neutral,mine stopped working it doesn work on mouse pad and freezes when use it on top of flat surface 
positive,i really liked it can hear people clearly and hear the game great and know whats going on around me in the game ourside noise does not distract me at all
positive,i like the headphones unfortunately the wire was too short for the lights to be plugged in to the usb port and the controller on my ps the usb plugin for the lights was about long and the rest of the cord was longer but the sound was great do have to keep one side off my ear because need to be able to hear other things in the house definitely comfortable 
positive,the sound quality is fine the mic quality is okay but the mic only works with my airmac and not on my windows pc its great set for the price would recommend for first time headset users 
positive,ordered this for my th grader she has laptop provided by her school and she received laptop from her grandparents as gift easy to switch between laptops with this mouse so she can watch youtube and play games on her personal laptop and scroll and jump between apps easily on the school laptop of course its not as solid as the apple version so thats why not stars
neutral,the scroll wheel broke after using this for like days very light use too 
neutral,this was my first headset ve bought and was pleased 
neutral,very nice keyboard fast shipping
negative,the mouse does well use it daily for work it lasts long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when am not using it so battery is not wasted sometimes can go weeks without charging my only complaint is the wheel have had it about months and the wheel started squeaking recently people can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts this is my rd wireless mouse the other were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all was common complaint on those 
positive,use this for my laptop and easy to use and works great very smooth would definitely recommend 
positive,really nice mouse smooth responsive the clicks are pretty noiseless this is my first wireless rgb mouse get so far not disappointed you can also use it while connected to the charging cable 
positive,mic is really trash but its cute and has good sound quality
positive,i purchased this mouse to use with chrome book it pairs well and have no complaints night owl who prefers the darkness so the color changing led lights was nice option that goes well with night of cram studying would totally try more of their products 
positive,this is great speaker and the phone charging feature is awesome sound quality is great for the size 
neutral,it works nicely 
positive,good quality and very nice color
positive,i love it it works perfect and love that it changescolors if you want 
neutral,very good sound easy blue tooth connection registering this product on the harmon jbl website is nightmare dont know but ll bet their customer service is the same just sayin 
negative,stiff and uncomfortable and the sound quality is worse than pair of earphones from wal mart 
positive,easy to use great on the hand good product 
positive,that it doesn light up on both sides of the headphones like thought it would of then that it was great 
neutral,worked great before it died after months of ownership 
negative,this worked great for while but after some months of regular use it has gotten glitchy sometimes it stops communicating with my computer the battery doesn last very long anymore it has become horrible for gaming currently shopping for new keyboard 
positive,it was loud enough thought it would do better on sound overall everything else is good
positive,this mouse is quiet as advertised so it nice as someone sleeps in my office while do schoolwork most of the time the sleep mode on it is nice but feel it triggers too soon that being said it bothersome but not deal breaker was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made sure it is but it traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident knock on wood sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it it could very well break or crack but if you treat it well don see why this mouse shouldn last you ve had it for about month now and the only thing can complain about is the sleep timer so take that as you will 
neutral,really like it
negative,started out and loved this mouse butwithin months it would not hold charge for more tha few hours annoying having to use it plugged in bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable if it was even once day could handle it since like the mouse but can stand charging every few hours so sad 
positive,i got this one to upgrade from my flip really really like it the battery lasts longer has great quality sound do notice that the speaker is clearly heard from whichever direction the front of the speaker is facing it also has fair distance in which the music can be heard even at lower volume 
neutral,yeah no the roller fell inside had barely used it
neutral,good for the price
positive,works well with something underneath otherwise it seems to wander besides that it feels great 
positive,loved the change of lights and the fell under my hand great mouse 
neutral,i have macbook and it would not connect have charged the mouse for hours and still will not connect 
neutral,no issues has good battery life looks slick and is really light weight 
positive,battery runs out in hrs after using it for less than months the shift key doesn work anymore some number keys are not responding intermittently unstable wireless connection caught with the good reviews 
positive,this mouse is sleek and has great feel it doesn require batteries so it is great mouse to have the led light is an added bonus 
positive,great quality value look sound 
neutral,good for gaming
positive,these headphones come in very nice durable box you really feel like they made it you safely the headphones themselves feel very nice and strong but still comfortable they fit on my adult head and my ear sit comfortably even with my piercings in the lights aren too bright and overwhelming but just right was surprised by the sound quality can hang these on my neck and still hear my game or music they hook up very easy and so far they seem like they will last definitely recommend them so far
positive,i actually loved the mouse my only issue was that the charger came and the usb part was little off and would not fit but other than that love the mouse it works great and easy to use 
neutral,hello
negative,when buy the jbl and open de box no coming the charger at for me it bad tem
neutral,really like the mouse until months in it started having issues just trying to move the cursor across the screen became struggle 
positive,i in small space so this thing is really loud which is great lots of bass also great not so much if you re looking for quality highs and such really happy about this purchase unless you re music sound quality critic you ll be happy too 
neutral,for this headset you have to constantly push the mouth piece as close to your mouth as possible which doesn really work well because the mic piece itself is plastic and when you are gaming you can constantly have hand holding the mic when need that hand for the game extreme caution when buying this it sound is good by itself but the mic part is awful will not be purchasing again 
neutral,this is good rechargeable keyboard that holds charge for long time you can still use the keyboard when it is plugged into usb port for charging placement of keys is taking some getting used to in particular the enter key as touch typist find myself hitting wrong keys when should be connecting with the enter key frustrating
positive,love it use it in my side by side out on the patio or back yard
positive,outstanding speaker with amazing base for the size linking to second or more speakers is fun party favor 
positive,the mouse lasts good while on charge as it shuts itself off good product 
positive,i really impressed with the klim chroma wireless keyboard it very easy to type on feels comfortable the colors are gorgeous and it was effortless to start using it klim definitely has my attention and very happy with their products the second product have along with the ultimate laptop cooling fan and just waiting for the rhapsody microphone to arrive quality and worth every penny and their customer service is which is the cherry on the top vivien and adrien are excellent at their customer service jobs thanks klim and please keep up the excellent integrity sincerely ca mackinnonmontreal quebec canada
positive,these headphones are great the sound quality is excellent can put the volume all the way up it just gets too loud the length of the cord is plenty long enough to be able to move around at the desk
positive,i don use this for gaming and haven used the sleep mode so can really rate it like the way it lights up and it good keyboard only issue is lost the charging cable and can seem to find replacement not even on their website do recommend this though 
neutral,i would give it no stars if could 
neutral,bengoo in blue got refund today thank you very much 
positive,i use this to game with am by no means an extreme or hard core gamer it works just fine for me to sit on my couch and play the witcher the light feature is nice if you want one you can customize look elseware this is budget keyboard and works well for what it is 
neutral,colors are fun but it doesn react great charge doesn last long if you forget to turn it off over night when it low on battery it doesn work well overall it an inconvenience amending my review to include the following if you post bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down first by offering refund when you tell them not interested they then offered bucks you can pay me to take review down that the point of review just make better product you should just refund me 
positive,where has this been all my life talk about making my typing on the tv from my ps way more accurate and fast what great keyboard easy to charge charges quickly and the colors are lovely and bright 
neutral,mouse doesn connect to computer even when fully charged and has usb plugged in am unable to even get refund 
positive,good value for the money sound quality is ok cord seems ridiculously long but perhaps it because it works on the pc too using for xbox comfortable to wear kind of big in size so if it for kid just know it may be enormous on them 
positive,great sound
neutral,we tried and have hard time trying to connect then it disconnects no light power for the macbook so don use this for any apple devices it does it should work but gives hard time get frustrated better for those other computers laptop
positive,the sound quality and sound direction is really great so far the headset is also very comfortable and almost cancels the noise completely when my mom is yelling at me 
positive,i travel lot wanted slim light mouse for work and school this mouse is perfect it fully charged in hours slim comfortable to use for hours when fully charged it can last for days also the changing light affect is pretty cool definitely recommend this mouse for someone who either works from home or is college student 
positive,feels great nice color looks like it will last very long time charge last along time as well 
positive,i wish the wireless keyboards lights could stay on at all times and that the lights could be customized but other than that very pleased 
positive,my son in law says it awesome
positive,great fit compact but very responsive 
positive,good mouse holds good charge perfect for gaming 
neutral,excelente
positive,great headset simple for what you need it for
positive,works great it little too small and would stress my hand if used it all day everyday but don so keeping it and am content to be more specific the buttons are not directly below my fingertips which would be solved by longer mouse or an ergonomic one that has little more height to it an averaged sized male and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha hope this helps 
neutral,decent material for cushioning not too heavy even for younger users all in all good headset for the price 
neutral,scroll function randomly stopped working months after buying can no longer return replace
positive,i bought this because wanted to get good bluetooth speaker and debated between this and the ue boom because they are about the same price after doing little research figured that the jbl would sound better and surprised the jbl sounds really good good bass at low volumes great mids and highs for portable speaker it does distort slightly when you get bass heavy song using spotify built in eq with bass boost but nothing little eq can solve it turns the bass down when you are close to max volume to protect itself which is nice and it still sounds decent at max volume range is awesome can walk about feet away before it starts cutting out hopefully it lasts will update review if it breaks from normal use or anything like that but so far so good 
positive,love these headphones perfect for pc gaming and even console gaming great sound long cord and light weight highly recommend 
positive,superb sound quality great dynamic range crisp highs and deep deep bass battery lasts for at least hours pairing is quick and stable app is simple and works fine can check charge level and play stereo or party mode with additional speakers seems durable and only hope it lasts buy and get ridiculously great mobile stereo for about

positive,i love it and the multicolored
neutral,no one can hear my partner through the microphone we ve tried on his ps phone and laptop 
positive, very light trendy easy to connect and use really love it
positive,honestly very surprised by the sound quality the noise cancelling would say is sometimes afraid can hear if someone calls me at home and the foam on the ear cups and the head part is really soft have longer head so these burly fit me but over all am really enjoying them now to see if they last long 
neutral,i like the headphones but they just don have the volume expected 
positive,great
neutral,this mouse stopped working after less than months would not recommend
positive,i got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it well day it wouldn charge so gave it break and decided to try charging it on my mac she had originally tried her school chrome book few seconds of it being plugged in it started smoking it smelled like burning plastic so quickly just unplugged and didn bother doing anything else with the mouse

positive,works perfect connects easy long rechargeable battery
positive,the wired mouse ve been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises love the convenience of this one being wireless so it easy to use with my desktop or laptop it super easy to install and while the buttons aren completely silent they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse the colorful leds are fun but it not feature ll be using lot so far ve had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all certainly recommend this mouse at this price point 
neutral,i did know fast delivery
neutral,this is really nice mouse like it and it works well the only thing is you charge it with mini usb charger and it takes long time not sure if not charging it all the way but it has short battery life 
positive,i love this mouse it fits my hands perfect use it lot and haven had any problems 
positive,i really like this bluetooth speaker jbl nailed it with this series can connect my speaker with friends speakers for the ultimate stereo experience highly recommend ive tried other brands but this is by far the best sounding and can listen all day

neutral,function well at work still 
neutral,stopped working after week 
positive,adorable mouse it works very well and love that you are able to recharge it the mouse speed is very good and overall very enjoyable to use while working from home 
positive,i wasn sure what to expect with this mouse but it works perfectly never thought be so excited to use wireless mouse 
neutral,poor sound quality

positive,works like charm you can change the mouse speed right from the actual device love it 
positive,fast shipping and works great
neutral,i bought this month ago was working perfectly fine until last week then for no reason it stop working properly it not responsive the cursor move does not match the movements of my hand and can no longer use it just ordered another mouse from other brands
neutral,misleading information purchased this as gift you can only use the lights or the microphone and speakers on the ps you can use them at the same time unless you want the console on your lap very disappointed 
neutral, it is nice mouse but it is not changing colors it only shows red
positive,it soft click which like love the colors and truly get about weeks of using it as my work mouse 
neutral,i have two problems no matter how long you charge it for it dead in an hour that if it been works the usb plug in takes two people to get out and afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer the appearance is great but it doesn work and could break the usb port because of this do not recommend since this posted the company offered to change review instead of just sending another mouse clearly they know there product does not work 
positive,i loved the look and feel of this mouse however it stopped working after only week of using it won charge at all and coworker said she had the same issue with the same mouse don waste your money 
positive,this mouse is quite comfortable and silent recommended 
neutral,it quit working after days and they wouldn take it back or refund 
positive,does exactly what it supposed to great product 
neutral,gaming
neutral,i bought this product and after months of use it already won charge light up work biggest waste of money do not buy
neutral,close by lacking quick response while using it it works but something gf elt off 
positive,just hit but it is cheaply made should hv purchased from best buy vs this one 
positive,i will be returning this overall it fine but isn what need if you aren fast typer and don use the ctrl and other functions like it it will be good for you there is lag in the keys and frequently have to retype words because it misses letters as type it also has to be in direct sight of the usb otherwise it doesn work the ctrl and other functions like it do not work and use these frequently they also for some reason redesigned the keyboard so the backslash is where the enter key usually is and the enter key is farther away have small hands as it is so cannot reach the enter key without picking up my hand which in inconvenient when doing things like typing an essay finally more of an aesthetic thing than anything do not like that the backlighting turns off without use the colors are pretty but want them to stay on so can still see the keyboard could understand it turning off after something like five or ten minutes of inactivity but it turns off after few seconds liked the idea of this keyboard but it just won work for me it lightweight the colors are nice the clack of the keys is the perfect volume and like that it has battery light but there are too many cons for me to keep it 
positive,the mouse was surprisingly lightweight am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes huge difference it is super sensitive too was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue my old mouse required mouse pad the lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off the usb receiver was easily found underneath it was bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick it also comes with the usb adapter which you don see often but believe it would work with chromebook or maybe with usb charger it has everything need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is 
positive,for gaming great quality 
neutral,rich sound adequate bass and midrange its heavier the smaller portable sound devices have owned but don have to worry about battery life we take this to the beach and will take it kayaking too 
positive,at first loved this mouse it worked great and the battery lasted long time but have bought of these now and the first one was faulty and this second one has only worked for about months and now will not connect this product would be fantastic if it worked longer that months but for the price it not terrible 
positive,i glad got this for my dad he loves it 
neutral,had it two months and it already dead what piece of junk so glad it quit working right after the return window closed quit scrolling and moving the cursor on the screen cheap piece of garbage 
neutral,this product is awful
neutral,although there is large american flag pictured on the product description this keyboard is made in china nowhere in the description does it say that paid premium for this keyboard for it to be made in the us and this is just false advertising 
neutral,i honestly got this product not so long ago and can really speak about the durability but wasn disappointed with my purchase the battery last for very long time and the light it just beautiful 
positive, oh my god this was everything was looking for bought mouse and keyboard for my phone because wanted to type my essays on my phone when don have computer and this mouse works on my phone yay and it my favorite color
neutral,mono speaker
positive,it works and it cheap so there that not great mouse by any means but then again it was also like so not mad
positive,works great
positive,i gave this to my dad for father day and he loved it 
positive,i love the product
neutral,remedied
positive,very nice mouse well designed and nice colors functioning well am satisfied with it 
neutral,reasonable price however item stopped working 
positive,light weight very easy to use charging lasts for long like that it has the usb attachment in mouse making it perfect for travel
positive,a little quiet for my intended use high noise environment but great sound for the price portable and durable battery doesn last super long when at full volume but can run off the cord 
neutral,i like that can use the charger it came with to charge it no batteries required 
positive,very comfortable and nice would definitely buy another
neutral,i bought this mouse in november and it just died april used this for working hours week and even took weeks of for maternity and wasn using this mouse so really this mouse only lasted months the usb bluetooth that plugs into the computer died the mouse will still light up when turn it off and on but then doesn do anything after that it was great mouse while it worked though guess shouldn be upset with this mouse compared to the price you get what you pay for 
negative,i am big on reviews peoples honest opinions when it counts as for style it nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good even if it completely charged it will only work for about minutes before it starts to freeze then eventually go dead it very frustrating annoying especially if you work from home would of posted pic but am in the process of returning it don feel like getting it 
positive,i love this keyboard use it for work connect it to tablet to type my reports it works great and love the different colors of the back lit keyboard 
positive,this small speaker is very impressive sound quality is amazing for small speaker very much recommend it 
positive,jbl as you know prides itself on high quality sound this company far exceeds anyone expectations when it comes to great sounding audio and solid build quality the jbl charge is very rugged and tough water proof speaker that really delivers on high quality sound this portable speaker is great for any party no matter the type and it works great with any genre of music when purchased this speaker already knew what was getting because had heard this speaker inside church where they had of them going all connected together and quite frankly they sounded like very expensive sound system and due to the wide expanse of the church sancturary the bass resonated very well from the music and all the mids and highs were also there there isn bit of speaker hiss or distortion from these speakers no matter how many are connected oh let me tell you about stereo mode now that is really sweet jbl really knew what they were doing when they implemented stereo mode for these speakers because let me tell you the stereo mode makes the music quite emerssive and realistic jbl sound signature is great and it definitely deserves star reward for excellence and quality the fact that you can connect of these together means that you can have sound all around you if you like believe me you ll be amazed at the bass that these little guys put out and the great stereo mode when connecting two of them together listen to all genres of music but my favorites are edm house and trance as well as country and soft rock edm music really bangs on these you will have your own version of the clubs when you use these speakers other genres of music sound great on them as well thanks to jbl signature sound which is extremely clear and detailed without any distortion whatsoever and since today music is all digital you need that kind of sound because nothing else will do the jbl charge speakers are definitely star in my book and urge everybody to get pair or of them if you can afford it haha as far as comparison between other similar speakers these put bose to shame matter of fact they blow bose clear out of the water bose ain got nothing on these speakers guaranteed now sony is good runner up but sony has small problem with sounding little muffled in my opinion actually own the jbl boombox and that monster really cranks out the bass and it is very loud the charge speakers are also very loud too for their size which is why am so impressed with them also love the fact that they have an ipx rating which means that you can put them in the water yes you can use these speakers in your shower you could take shower in stereo yep totally water proof stereo now isn that something hey if you had smart phone that was also water proof the entire stereo system could go in the shower with you haha hmmm new adult pool toy your water proof stereo so if were you would get these bad boys today and let the party begin 
neutral,i haven used this product for at least day and it is already not working it doesn track properly to my computer this is the worst mouse save your money and don buy this
positive,daughter loves it 
neutral,this product stopped working after month and of course am outside of my return window
negative,unfortunately missed the return window by less than month do lot of panning around for my work with the middle scroll wheel button and the button has issues about half the time where it doesn register that clicked or gets stuck it cute but wouldn buy it again update just wrote this review couple days ago the scroll wheel just broke fully no more intermittent use use it lot but bought it literally two months ago 
neutral,this keyboard randomly starts having wrong keystroke inputs for example pressing types pressing tab types started happening months after purchasing never buying this brand again 
neutral,it changes color and that feature can be switched on and off but that it it doesn work at all as mouse with my macbook even with using the included receivers 
neutral,only downfall is it not wireless but otherwise it does the job my son uses it for gaming on his xbox his pc and online school 
neutral,the microphone doesnt work with ps went through all of the troubleshooting steps twice and the mic is digital garbage at best and completely unresponsive at worst wish had looked deeper into the reviews before adding to my wish list and having people waste their money on this product
negative,this is horrible product my son has gone through two of these keyboards and they do not hold up keep their charge they both were used for about weeks before they would not keep their charge and would stop working within few minutes after charging all night this product is absolute garbage 
neutral,the adapter for the laptop doesn work have one from dell which worked fine 
neutral,it what expected accept they forgot to put the adapter in the box bout of them the other one had its adapter sooo stars for being mostly right 
neutral,it works well it does what purchased it for 
neutral,got this for my son he likes it
negative,cheap plastic breaks very poor design penny wise hundred stupid return games with ups gas burned life wasted heartbroken birthday gift paper wasted stress the arm holing microphone moveable to adjust snapped off was taped on better and stronger then the whole thing combined looks great blue lights not 
negative,and it only wireless half the time the other half you ll have it plugged in and charging because charge doesn last very long that why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse that makes it hard to use when charging everyone knows it easier to drag chain up hill than to push it up well everyone but these people update the battery has completely gone dead it won even take charge anymore after only three months you have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast you have to wait to seconds for it to charge just so you can use it for another seconds it even worse than the star rating gave it originally 
positive,for cheaoer headset works great 
positive,amazing
positive,bought these for my daughter for her gaming computer and she is absolutely in love with them they don hurt her ears and they work great
positive,awesome to use not too expensive husband loved them
negative,this is my fourth jbl speaker my very first one was the little to go that lasted forever ve had it for years now and my daughter still uses it my second one was charge three it lasted year and half before the battery stopped working my second charge three year and half as well battery stopped working now just ordered charge four ve had it for little over week now and it glitches it staticky and it horrible don will ever buy another jbl am very disappointed with the charge edit ve had it couple weeks and the battery only stays charged for day do not waste your money 
positive,i love it the battery last decente amount of time
neutral,once received this product am very satisifed with how it looks and how light it felt it is also very convenient considering it is rechargeable with no batteries needed highly recommend this product 
neutral,the scroll wheel stopped working right after the return window closed so can even return it 
negative, not so great with the rendering dragging objects with the mouse is not so great especially acrosss screens work on visio lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around so basically has bad sensor but its smooth and very quiet 
positive,great speaker take it anywhere as long as you have the space for it it big speaker but it honking battery life let me use it and charge my phone with it at the same time literally great speaker 
neutral,i unboxed it plugged it into my laptop after charging it and it would not even connect to my computer at all completely dissatisfied with my time and money with this product if you re looking for mouse this isn it 
neutral,i have already ordered the black one and liked it so much orderer another one for my laptop 
positive, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work 
negative,i bought these to replace my old cheap headphones tried these on and they sounded worse than my old ones also no returns allowed disappointing 
negative,the color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty the scroll wheel on the mouse is made from cheap rubbery silicone material and is completely crooked it also did not have good feel when testing it out not smooth and feels like it take lot of extra pressure to operate than others not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned 
neutral,broke already won charge can return stay away from this mouse 
positive,great amazing sound
positive,my new go to for great sound quality at all volumes portability and nice design bought with the silicon holster and the travel case using it indoors with my tv and to stream music at outdoor events and camping 
positive,i ll be honest at such low price didn have big expectations was ready to try them and send them back if didn like them positives the sound quality is actually really good and it does block out ambient noise they are comfortable don think they are too heavy some of the wireless headphones hurt after awhile one reason choose wired negatives it had volume control and although nice to have it adds weight to the cord so have to make sure put the volume control in my lap or else it pulls on the headphones and it heavy the mic only moves up and down which wish it could move away or towards your mouth too overall for the price these are nice 
negative,had it for only one day until accidentally dropped it from less than meter and the stroller wheel broke could fix it with superglue but come on shouldn have to do that it was cheaply made and it literately broke day if you re thinking of buying this don let me stop you from trying it just don drop it 
neutral,no need for further comments here this product will speak for itself
positive,i love it would recommend 
positive,works great
positive,this mouse was amazing when first got it and it worked amazing for the first few months then started having connecting issues so direct hooked it up to my pc and it worked like that for day now it doesnt work at all dont waste your money on this 
positive,very easy to set up works perfectly fine with my macbook air 
positive,got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn work light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn work figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work mouse was doing great until found issue with its sleep mode when the mouse falls asleep to save battery it wakes up very quickly however from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed it ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem so the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible have to turn it on and off as needed 
positive,honestly this product is super good especially for the price my brother has his own pair of gaming headphones they are different brand that cost about would say that this for lot cheaper sounds better and fits better than his if you needed one real fast would say buying this would be good option that what did was having problems in class with my mic so had to buy new headphones and this did the job

neutral,good head set
negative, cannot type in frequently for no reason when it not working it connected with pc for sure because tab alt was working but others like space enter delete and all have no reactions using my phone to write this review because can type in amazon com in my browser if it only happened time that fine the problem is it happened several times so frustrated

neutral,batteries don last long mouse is uncomfortable to use goes into sleep mode waaay too fast and has to be turned off and back on to reconnect it
negative,the stupid lights cannot be turned off it runs the battery flat every night if you forget to recharge the mose you are sunk in single day it is uncomfortable and decides you have released mouse key by itself very annoying it is in my rubbish bin 
positive,awesome speaker
neutral,usb adaptor is not working but that why bought this mouse

neutral,we ride side by sides and sometimes it hard to hear the tunes not problem with the charge 
positive,very portable good battery life great sound quality
neutral, light pink quiet when click smooth across my mouse pad and does not get stuck led lights change often all as advertised from my concern 
positive,great gaming headset for my son 
positive,i was tired of using wireless mouse that needed change of batteries to quickly lucky found these wireless rechargeable mouse the first thing did when the package arrived was to charge the mouse fully so far is working without problems the mouse is slim and very comfort the multicolored led is delightful touch that will be an excellent companion to the multicolored led mouse pad my review is based on regular use can have opinion regarding how the mouse works for gaming because just controller for that update after just few months the surface of the mouse looks like is peeling and is very noticeable even with proper cleaning the mouse keeps working and the leds 
neutral,works well wish that the ear pieces were bit more comfortable sound quality very good mic seems to be good but windows settings keep changing don think it is in the headset fault 
positive,this is by far the best sound out of many bluetooth speakers that have owned highly recommend 
positive,it worked for month and half now it glitchy and won work pass this up and buy quality mouse looks pretty with the colors other than that it was waste of money 
negative,the set broke after two months usage only the sound quality became terrible suddenly and wouldn work for gaming
negative,first the keyboard is too dim and you cannot change the led colors also could someone on earth explain why you chose red led as color and that makes night visibility bad
neutral,home computer use not gaming 
positive,for this is the best wireless mouse ve ever used set it up in two minutes feels good in my hand the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent cannot stand loud clicking mice got this for my work computer and think also going to get one for my laptop 
positive,soft click it light weight cute lights love it 
positive,the headphones seem to be well made and the sound quality is great these were bought with the thought that they would be good for working at home but my customers keep saying they can hear me would imagine it would be just fine for gaming 
negative,these ended up being bit of disappointment we got them for our son for christmas and we didn realize that in order for the lights to work the cord also needs to be plugged into usb port he was using them mostly with tablet so this was bummer now only three months later the cord has completely severed and they don work at all these have had extremely light wear and tear never leaving the house and only used for couple hours day 
positive,loved the headset incredible sound
positive,i ve had this baby for about year probably more sounds as good as day one perfectly water proof in the shower battery life feels infinite bluetooth connectivity is smooth and fast adore this thing only thing to note is that when you charge your phone with it the battery is drained pretty quick but it charges surprisingly fast it not gonna be enough volume for large party but for get together with friends its more than plenty you can hook up additional speakers if you need extra juice anyway so it not even problem the mono speaker doesn feel mono at all everything sounds on point
positive,you can turn off the colors it lights up the entire time you re using it bought the white mouse of this brand and love that one
positive,this mouse is great it sleek responsive and has awesome led colors that rotate best bang for my buck 
positive,i love it 
neutral,excelente
neutral,mouse works lgb died almost immediately the only color actively working on this mouse is the red led and the blue when charging when the mouse is left idle for minute or two it seems to desync and takes minute to wake up it gets in the way more often than not otherwise okay product 
negative,we received the headset today my year old son put them on to play but the ear muffs are way to small they hurt his ears my husband and also tried them on to see what he was talking about when he said they hurt and they actually do hurt your ears

positive,outstanding honestly the best portable speaker out there connect with friends must for college 
positive,so far they work perfect im hapoy for the price

positive,good sound and fit the extra hook ups for other counsel 
neutral,not working after months of use
neutral,the product is not worth the price because the keys are too big the lights are dimmed and it felt poorly made in general although it worked correctly would spend money elsewhere
neutral,the slim design fits well in my small hands
neutral,no need for further comments here this product will speak for itself
positive,great keyboard very responsive keys
neutral,doesn work with my pc yet other headphones or mics do 
positive,great sound great battery strong construction fits well in packs if you ve done the research you know the differences between what you are looking for if you haven and skipped to reviews sound is better than the charge not as big or loud as the extreme but still impressive fatter and more rugged than the flip jbl is good brand

positive,best bt speaker ve bought by far easily connect sound is very clear and the bass is jumping great buy
positive,works great only use the usb to connect it to my ps and no problems so far using the wireless 
positive,don get me wrong do like this mouse it smooth pretty easy to use and overall pretty great but and this is strong but if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it or my dog or even me it could be super light and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over it really annoying 
neutral,at first this mouse was the best ever however whenever it touches table the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up it was still very comfortable though however months later whenever turned it on it would start autoclicking and the only way to stop it is to remove the usb charger it great for the first months but then started failing me 
positive,i love the sleep mode so easy to use

neutral,it very cheap headset if you re just looking for something that ll just get the job done this works it not bad or terrible just cheap although after wearing the headset for while my ears started to hurt but that might ve been personal issue
positive,really great to connect well sounds great
neutral, was in the market for new mouse as my logitech wireless was going bad on me was red to stay wireless and had budget the logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when wanted one that looked cool and the cheaper ones were too normal looking got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were cool feature got it and it feels great it feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn have the typical mouse click sound edit had to get other mouse as my first broke it was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident since it was so cheap just bought another and it works as well as the first 
positive,literally from the box it won light up or download the software to be able to use my mouse won move and it says compatible with mac that is absolutely untrue can you explain to me why that stated in the description it the only reason purchased this and it doesn work disappointed 
neutral,the lettering on the kb is so faint you can see them unless the backlit is on problem is you can turn auto dim off which means you have to hit key to wake it up if you can have it backlit when you reach for it when gaming it utterly useless in dark room does it work for the price yes does it work for gaming nope not at all 
positive,good value for the looks good quiet buttons fancy light up feature no batteries to replace 
neutral,keys are smooth and with quick response when typing 
positive,cool looking and feels great 
positive,these compact portable speakers kick your ear buds love them great sounds
neutral,i love this speaker it very loud speaker if you have small place your living in the sound can be heard through out the whole house the battery sometimes die fast but just keep it on the charger 
positive,the keyboard is good but wish the battery last longer than couple of days in stead of having to charge it every two days 
positive,the sound quality is amazing for gaming cancels out noise very well
positive,great 
positive,great speaker love that can use it outside easy setup 
negative,bought of these in april both dead purchased two of these for two computers one died about weeks ago to me it seemed the battery wasn holding charge contacted klm for product support sent three emails and heard nothing in return klim product support no matter how fancy their webpage is then grabbed the other one and started using it on my fulltime pc and it died today the fact that one used daily and the other used half as much both died within weeks of each other is very telling two keyboards lasted months if this isn the definition of junk don know what it

neutral,left it on overnight and then tried to charge it up for work now it doesn work
positive,best headset ive ever bought
positive,it does what it supposed to do works as wireless mouse beautiful color and works like charm 
positive,sound quality might need little bit of bass but come on we are playing games not listening to music great in my opinion

positive,very good quality and great sound 
neutral,this mouse worked ok for couple of months then it just won work anymore tried charging it and it just doesn do it waste of money 
positive,this company is the best their products are all amazing especially this keyboard if anything goes wrong they will quickly send you replacement they fully stand by their products best company ever

positive,excellent mouse very smooth 
positive,i just love this wireless mouse it not big and bulky the clicking is quite and it really cute looking 
positive,i was looking for pair of head phones for my gaming system and these are great
neutral,he likes it
positive,it fine keyboard for the amount paid but it doesn work as well as some other wireless keyboards the charge didn seem to hold too long for mine feel like have to charge it often also needed it to be on my craft table which is not too far from my computer but the distance can use it wirelessly is poor needed it to allow me to work farther from my computer but couldn go as far as wanted 
neutral,this is just the second day since got this mouse for my laptop and it doesn work anymore lost my money
neutral,it does not recharge
neutral,they look like the photo the set comes with appropriate cords they work so far noise cancellation got only stars because can still hear people talking at normal volume around me 
positive,this mouse is awesome the lights are fun and have owned it weeks and only charged it once and use it daily
positive,the headset is comfortable the sound is great quality 
neutral,this item shuts off and on while you re using it have to smack it onto my desk to get it to wake up piece of junk
neutral,worked great for month then the center button stopped working 
neutral,works fine nothing special and not quite as smooth as standard mouses you can get at big box stores for 
positive,at first bought these wired headphones so could use them for my nintendo switch but use them now for anything that isn my phone they are very comfortable and give high quality sound that makes games feel that bit more immersive it is also very convenient to switch them between devices unlike bluetooth earpieces there also isn audio latency with compared to bluetooth either definitely recommend these headphones 
neutral,this is really great mouse it works as designed unfortunately don have the patience for the very slow response time it was aggravating waiting for it to respond to my finger commands needless to say got rid of it and bought something different 
negative,everything bad sound is wack
positive,great quality for low price better than some of my friends expensive sets
neutral, doesn light up since got it and only one headphone work
positive,has this headset for over years and have no complaints super comfortable so you can wear them for long time with no irritation nice click for the mute feature if you re like me and need to check if you re muted or not this is the headset for you 
positive,works well my year old loves it for fortnite so he can chat with friends while playing 
positive,i like that this mouse os sleek in design has long battery life and is easy to set up often forget to turn it off but that doesn matter because it goes into sleep mode to preserve battery the only concern my tablet has type so the converter is helpful the only thing that would change is that the converter doesn fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet 
negative,i can hear but the mic does not work may have gotten defective set 
neutral,mouse worked fine for two weeks shape took some getting used to since it low profile charge held up pretty well but the scroll wheel broke after few weeks of use so in the trash it goes 
positive,amazing sound
positive,great speaker great sound long lasting battery life 
neutral,fits my head without giving me headache cancels noise good range of volume long cord 
positive,fantastic
positive,so happy bought two of this headphones 
positive,got these as an intended upgrade for previous headset got from walmart wasn expecting much but wish had kept the walmart headset now that ve tested these they work just fine for video playback no real complaints there my main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how crummy the microphone is the store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my laptop and this microphone my laptop consistently provides louder clearer results compared to this headset there was still quite noticeable background noise in the headset recording as well there also some design flaws with how the microphone is implemented it is completely rigid peice of plastic that only rotates vertically so it just ends up hanging good to inches from your mouth when deployed yes got out ruler and measured it that off this is compared to other headset mics which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer and in front of your mouth instead of beside it the cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw simply put the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of cheap toy the case on the connecting band is bit better being made from matte plastic but not by much the only things on this device that don feel like they were slapped together for as low material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the mm audio jack and the usb that powers the contractually obligated gamer lights have honestly forgone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing and microphone that actually somewhat flexible so can actually hear myself speak overall average playback quality nothing that would impress an audiophile but nowhere near terrible it painfully average and unfortunately that more than can be said for the rest of the device bad microphone design and quality just don bother got better results from the built in microphone array in my thinkpad from than did with this thing el cheapo feel like toy from dollar store verdict if you care about quality in your headset don buy this they sell this thing for at regular price got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount even still somewhat regret spending money on this thing and be leagues more disappointed had paid the full asking price for it it barely worth it weight at ish dollars and there no way it worth the normal if you just want something for discreet audio playback go find better headset or just settle for some earbuds there plenty of decent options for the latter under both in retail stores and online this one isn worth your time or your money the only reason even keeping this is because returning products has always been pain in my experience and because the headset itself technically works but that it it not even worth the hassle of chasing down refund 
neutral,i love connecting two of these bad boys or more you can connect upto of these guys 
positive,they worked great for two months then the mic went out boo 
negative,quality of sound is good however volume level compared to previous model sucks and the bluetooth changed so now the old models can connect to the new models that really dumb to not have back compatible technology my sister has previous model and it fills back yard of several acres can barely hear this across my warehouse would say it to as loud as previous bought it to hear above the refrigerator units and its disappointing for the price oh well guess that the price you pay for buying something online that you can hear the exact unit first 
negative,mouse is comfortable to use silent clicks however failed after only months of use use every day for maybe couple of hours at time turned off when not in use and plugged in when necessary died about week ago after having for only months would not recharge will not use rechargeable mouse again would rather use rechargeable batteries 
positive,definitely worth the money
neutral,i used it for my school chrome book and all of sudden it fell of my desk and it broke 
positive,my son loves it that all that matters
negative,it was good product until my dog decided to make it it chew toy my son used it for gaming only had to listen to him yell out things instead of all the players yelling ish out and whining about who was killing who blah blah blah
negative,i liked the size and ease of charging but very dissatisfied with the lack of reliability and of course both stopped working just past the point could return waste of money useless without the scrolling wheel 
neutral,the headphones were not clear enough for me to hear words 
neutral,product worked as mentioned little uncomfortable over the ears after couple of hours for those who wear glasses good bang for your buck 
negative,have had this less than two months and it doesn work at all after hours of charging computer only recognizes clicks but no movement at all waste 
positive,this is our nd one the size sound ease of use durability and quality are outstanding 
neutral,i have dark living room can see the keyboard this one glows in neon colors makes it easy to see what you are typing being cordless allows me to sit on the couch play games type mails etc without restrictions best one have had yet 
neutral,granddaughter likes the lights
positive,the sound quality on this is wonderful it is directional so it won do sound but music sounds beautiful with rich and full bass the battery life is fantastic perfect for an all night party or all day event it comes with the capability to charge any usb devices you may have it is little on the heavier side but still is portable enough to put in your backpack or basket on your bike very satisfied 
neutral,not the best quality ve seen but for the price it ranks pretty high 
neutral,felt awful on my head and just cheap plastic
positive,love my mouse love that it comes with the usb adapter it was very easy to instal works perfectly 
neutral,worked for few months then stopped intermittently 
neutral,would recommend and would buy again 
positive,my son loves these headphones 
neutral,the speaker performs exactly as expected it has big sound for such small device 
neutral,this is the second time have ordered this mouse actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and have to order new one so for that reason am only going to give you two stars ordered this particular mouse only two months ago and it already broken should get my money back 
neutral,this speaker has exceeded my expectations way louder than expected often being asked to turn it down 
neutral,it works lasting charge but it is flimsy used for like weeks no problem cool lighting but im not sure how will it will hold up
positive,sounds great excellent quality 
neutral,i like it but bit uncomfortable need bigger ear cups 
negative,the fact that you can keep the lights always on totally defeats the purpose of buying this product for gaming and night time using the lights turn off too fast if you are not constantly typing something even at their longest settings and you can select just one of the five colors of the leds so you are stuck with the rainbow lights also it not that very quiet compared to an old mechanical keyboard have it only about quieter hate the fact that thought was buying an american product because of the american flag on their main advertising image on it front page but it made in china 
neutral,product is extremly cheap looks like something from five below or wish you can see right through it and it dies really fast im sad missed the return window but will be buying new product
positive,i got sick of using my touchpad and needed an actual mouse for printing software trying to rotate and re size print patterns with touchpad was nightmare but this is great mouse for the price and has already made my life lot easier 
neutral,the device looks and feels good the left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click the coloring is good looking but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge the short charging cord connects to the computer so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse which is inconvenient but the control of the curser is good although occasionally it seems to jump to different place on the screen still not sure why that happens but it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it quirks 
positive,its good mouse and its different from your standard mouse like the fact it lights up 
negative, bought this mouse read direction simple and easy plug in to phone charger for hrs then unplug mouse will turn blue say it need to be charged hrs then it will turn red then go to mouse plug in the usb port in to windows computer then turn button on mouse underneath to on then try mouse out to see if it moves on computer give this out of stars dont give in to bad reviws people post bad reviews and never reads instruction first
positive,in short you get what you pay fori am currently traveling and needed cheap mouse could use this one definitely does the trick and looks nice with the colors on the side but also has couple downsides the dpi change button doesn work on mac the colors at the border aren really bright and even the red light of the sensor always shines through it also is bit small if you have big hands which is upset if you re traveling since it will fit in small spaces in general it is good mouse if you do not want to spend lot of money but there are things that could be better if you want to spend bit more 
positive,it works well lights up very pretty rechargeable very quiet
neutral,has way to much static and chooses when it wants to work 
positive,bought as gift and seemed to be received well love the color
neutral,i love this keyboard have poor eyesight and if for get where key is while touch typing the letters on the keys are big enough so don have trouble seeing them also the keypresses are very quiet 
positive,i use this for when am showering and got it to replace bose bt speaker that is about years old it was no longer holding charge and kept disconnecting from the bt the sound is so good ve taken it around the house with me it came partially charged so fully charged it before used it ve had it for weeks now and haven had to charge it yet the sound quality is incredible the bass is window shaking if you are on the fence get it it supposed to be waterproof too but haven tested it love it 
positive,worked great for month mouse connects via usb receiver ve only disconnected the receiver few times when not using the mouse however after disconnecting few times can reconnect the receiver without it being loose the instant my mouse connects it will disconnect because the usb is too loose now after month edit customer service reps have reached out to me offering me money to delete my review 
neutral,stagnant mouse movement dont buy this if you use your mouse often 
positive,i got the jbl charge and it worth every penny highly recommend this speaker the sound quality is insane was blown away even tested it under water for minutes and it true waterproof can say enough great things jbl won me over 
neutral,cursor would only work couple minutes then freeze up love the look shape but it completely useless

neutral,took on camping trip boat trip and had no issues 
neutral,good product but after wearing for period of time it begins to stretch out and loosen on the ears wrap them tight when storing to reset them 
negative,i was searching for bluetooth mouse found one but didn like the color when changed to the silver one some how it switched off of bluetooth it is wireless and did work with the usb dongle the buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth unfortunately have mac and the usb ports are only usb the mouse does come with an adapter but this makes it stick out far and will get damaged had to return it 
positive,this mouse is quiet as advertised so it nice as someone sleeps in my office while do schoolwork most of the time the sleep mode on it is nice but feel it triggers too soon that being said it bothersome but not deal breaker was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made sure it is but it traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident knock on wood sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it it could very well break or crack but if you treat it well don see why this mouse shouldn last you ve had it for about month now and the only thing can complain about is the sleep timer so take that as you will 
positive,i just purchased this headset because my old one crapped out on me can hear sounds fine but even at max volume it really quiet when tested the mic by doing short recording in audacity it was super quiet and sounded like was inside well covered by blanket when speaking at normal inside volume used different program to rectify this kind of the mic is now better volume but still sounds like crap guess it technically does what it supposed to but even for only thirty ish bucks this headset is not great probably just going to buy different one and keep this one as backup in case need it the only real pro of the headset is that it decently comfortable bottom line don recommend this thing ve spent less on better quality headsets before 
positive,this is perfect for gaming 
neutral,works well but there is no way to adjust treble or base sound quality isn what we expected it to be used it days with variety of music and returned it 
negative,i used this mouse once and it died after an hour was on the charger literally over night now can even get it to charge at all waste of my money 
neutral,the sound only comes through on one side and it not very loud
positive,i was wary of buying no name brand mouse but it turned out to be even better than expected it super sleek and looks great with the leds it also functions very well the clicks are almost silent if you ve used cheap mouse that has loud clicks you ll know what talking about haha and it very reactive use it for light gaming and it perfect haven even had to charge it yet which is amazing absolutely worth it for the price 
positive,not sure why people are not giving this all stars this sound on this thing is wild and that fact that it waterproof is amazing love it 
positive,it was wonderful mouse when it arrived however it quit working 
negative,i ve had this about month and it struggling to hold charge and the mouse is jumping there is also no option to return ll be going back to regular battery operated one as rechargeable is just not reliable dissapointed 
positive,some reviews says these headphones are better than ones no they are not have sony studio monitor mdr to compare with specs shows hz to khz not even close to khz sound like from metal barrel without high frequencies and with over boosted bass can not turn off led light there is thing like button on sound control box thought it should be led switch button it is not button at all

neutral,i bought these about month ago they are already cutting out and fuzzy and in fact were doing so merely few days into my purchase do not recommend how this headset has such high ratings is beyond me 
positive,got these for both the hubby and kiddo they are pretty great 
neutral,while the shape of this rechargable mouse is nice the crappy battery refused to be recharged after less than three months don buy this 
positive,it was gift for my daughter and she is delighted
positive,i bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag this fits the bill this mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites using office applications like word excel and powerpoint etci would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes and that is not what it is meant for anyway if you want mouse that works for web browsing office work on the go looks nice and is slim and compact get this device 
neutral,jbl makes the best bt speakers hands down there no competition ll be buying another to pair them both

neutral,doesn stay charged long and some functions don work 
positive,it sounds pretty good and can take it anywhere love it
positive,amazing tool for my job that required lot of documentation 
neutral,only took month or so for the mike to go out 
positive,used for months and now it won charge 
positive,only months old and already won charge pretty but not very long lasting
neutral,so it has problems the biggest one was the move the cursor on it own like it just spazzes out could work with it didn mind it all that much besides it being real annoyance when gaming then it got more frequent and then the roller that scrolls broke and only had it for week or two so now got to replace it not great product looks nice but made cheap which suppose is why it is 
positive,love everything about them
positive,my son is happy and uses for distance schooling and gaming he breaks headphones all the time so hope they hold up
neutral,piece of junk doesn work probably why it on sale 
positive,it lives up to my expectation have used it almost everyday it has made my life better love it

neutral,the adapter for the laptop doesn work have one from dell which worked fine 
positive,so loved this speaker until it just gave up on me after nothing even close to twenty hours of playtime advertised on amazon pretty bad think going to return it 
neutral,great keyboard not loud just wish more rgb settings
positive,it is nice mouse and liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook however the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable the adapter seems flimsy and cheap luckily had an adapter and the mouse now works fine if you are buying this for mac would recommend investing in good adapter 
neutral,exactly what was looking for but get longer micro usb to usb charging cable the one it comes with is only about inches long just long enough to charge off your laptop 
positive,is amazing keyboard for the game is little slower 
positive,this is great mouse quiet responsive fun color 
positive,i made sure that this product was gonna be good one and was not disapointed it silent click which is nice the lights look awesome on it it was just worth it 
positive,perfect budget mouse if your working with macbook like am very smooth and responsive but wouldn recommend for gaming because any crazy fast movement can kind of lag but for my online studies it been perfect very very long battery life don think ve charged it since bought it 
neutral,i wanted to love it the sound quality was great but sadly the microphone would not work no matter what did so have to return them 
neutral,so bought jbl it came with case charging cable and socket adapter jbl cost more and only came with speaker nothing else sound quality was the same get jbl cost less and comes with more 
neutral,my son likes it 
positive,i have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand this mouse is lower so don need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click it not cure but it great that it fits my hand much better and doesn put as much strain on my hand 
negative,the battery life on it is crap you have to recharge it every few hours it not worth the hassle when it charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn move the cursor the way you move the mouse 
positive,these headphones are pretty good for gaming especially at the price recommend getting these if your not trying to break the bank in downside in my opinion is how big the volume control is 
positive,the product worked great for day and then suddenly stopped took me minutes of fiddling to get the headphones to work again and couldn get the mic working wouldn recommend going to try returning the product and hopefully will have better experience 
positive,these work great good shutting out noises they sound great you can tell the suround sound good bass only down side to me is they seem to be made for laptop cause the the usb cord for the lights is super short for controller use you could put one of those power bars on it button it just hangs there other then that great buy
positive,i bought for my daughter works great for everything she wants school and gaming 
neutral,this mouse doesn work on of surfaces including my mouse pad it also slow and laggy 
positive,it good for it price and actually came with audio splitter which was nice 
positive,the headphones are amazing bass boosting is insanely good however the microphone in little over week of having this headset began to crackle and cut out my friends kept telling me they couldn hear me or outright telling me that all they got was static and crackling tried everything from updating my drivers to tampering with sound settings to reseating the audio cables into different ports the only conclusion was left with was the cable was somehow so poorly made that it failed in just over week am extremely disappointed could ve spent somewhere else four and half stars how 
positive,they are awesome and great sound 
positive,this keyboard shipped quickly and is very easy to use love the colors in the backlighting the customer service was also great highly recommend 
neutral,it good for lighting up mouse but isn for gaming really

neutral,nice
positive,this is good product it fits well in my hand and love that it is rechargeable would buy this mouse again don use it for gaming since that is something don do it serves my purpose well 
neutral,i only used this mouse few times and the wheel scroll broke after months would other wise be stars
neutral,wish the battery lasted longer seem to have to recharge it every month vs rechargeable batteries last me months before need to recharge otherwise nice ergonomic shape and low enough to not affect the wrist the optical sensor is not so great especially when battery is low 
negative,stopped charging after months poor quality 
positive,great buy more than hoped for at this price
positive,used for months and now it won charge 
positive,so cute and charge lasts forever

neutral,the mouse lasted one day changed the battery it still wont turn on urrgggg 
positive,this mouse is great 
positive,bought as gift for my son he loves it 
positive,for gaming its good and the audio is amazing would recommend to friends 
neutral,the sound is really good but the reason why gave it four star for gaming is because wear glasses and most headphones make usually make my ears hurt but this one is really great at lessening that but of course it not perfect
positive,they are so comfortable and work as described the sound is as if your in movie theater clear and perfect 
neutral,you get what you pay for guess they were great at first but then one of them the usb port bent and broke and took the jaws of life to pull out of our usb port the second one the top of the mouse fell off 
neutral, 
positive,we really enjoy this speaker for outdoor dining on the patio
neutral,was good while it lasted not even year and the thing doesn charge anymore 
neutral,never worked
positive,comfortable keyboard very good must have 
positive,got it for my bf he loves it just wishes the light would stay on without it being connected to the outlet 
neutral,within minutes of putting them on had to take them off because they were crushing my ears on the temples of my glasses returned them immediately 
positive,the speaker is easy to set up and use it produces good sound at an attractive price 
positive,this works well for my son xbox series he likes it would have given stars if the usb cord that is to inserted into the port on the xbox was longer because that cord is so short he not able to experience the blue led while playing 
positive,won recharge after owning it for about months only used it hand full of times 
positive,overall the headset is honestly not bad for the pricing that it was it has good audio and all components are together 
negative,i like that is quiet mouse however one side of the mouse stopped working was going to see if can get an exchange and missed it by days broken in less than month 
negative,disappointed no usb or booklet supplied 
positive,great headphones nice selection of colors and can be used on multiple devices
positive,as previous jambox owner purchased this because was told there would be good bass sound clarity and volume love playing loud music when showering unfortunately this wasn it wish could return because it not given what was sold 
positive,i had high expectations for the jbl charge because it has lot of competition and gets good reviews it not exactly cheap either this implies that the charge should be optimistically almost as good as bose for example unfortunately not call me sonically spoiled use yamaha hs and hs monitors on isolation stands at home my truck has bose system that delivers bass mids and highs like reference system ve heard plenty of bose bluetooth speakers and they ve sounded good used to hearing everything crisp and clear having said all of that many people will hear this speaker and be blown away by the quality it not terrible and it actually sounds good in stereo with two connected together unfortunately it not that simple stereo mode is very unreliable and wonky with single charge the highs and mids sound pretty unappealing the best word can think of to describe its overall sound is flat and sloppy with punchy bass the sound stage is disappointingly one dimensional unless you buy second one and use jbl jbl connect app to run them in stereo stereo mode gives these charge an instant drastic improvement in sound but my speakers switch out of stereo mode and into party mode dual mono every time switch between apps and sometimes just from hitting pause for second this should have never made it past qa at jbl didn know that was happening at first but did notice that things went from sounding great to sounding terrible even with two connected that party mode it two copies of the same sounds right on top of each other don want that want left and right speakers that work reliably stereo mode gives wide stereo image and somehow balances out the lone charge inadequacies bit but can even count on it to work properly to summarize think the charge has potential to make good quality bluetooth audio solution but only if you plan on buying two and only if jbl improves stereo mode functionality right away the app should remember which mode the speakers were on and keep it that way or let us choose default mode either would help tremendously 
neutral,works just as described 
positive,the charge is awesome great sound awesome bass and jbl connect can link up to speakers and that any model jbl speaker that has the jbl connect waterproof is really nice bump tunes in the shower and not worry bout messing up my speaker also purchased silicone case that has strap and now can carry it over my shoulder really convienent for when ur out and about like the beach outdoor event etc the only problem have is that it doesn have microphone microphone have the charge it has microphone use the charge on calls all the time can be doing other work in room and still have fluent conversation with no hearing issues that big deal for me the sounds hair better now if it only had mic 
negative,the rechargeable battery died in weeks had to keep the power plugged in and then last night it started malfunction and typing erroneous things absolute junk don buy it 
neutral,i never dropped the speaker or put it in water dont know why the speaker does not charge anymore only had this speaker for about weeks 
neutral,stopped working after weeks would not buy again 
positive,i needed wireless mouse and specifically wanted one that matched my new laptop this mouse exceeded my expectations love the that it lights up and comes in variety of colors it kinda hard to find silver mouse especially one that is compatible with type usb so am happy 
neutral,i have been able to use this product since aug and then out of the blue the roller wheel stopped working like it disconnected from the internal workings and now wont scroll this is very disappointing 
positive,i love the headphones they allow you to change the volume and mute the mic without touching the screen would like if the mic was adjustable 
positive,i use this speaker on my pool deck great sound 
positive,awesome will definitely purchase again 
positive,won last not even year this is garbage
positive,amazing headphone large sturdy headphone with comfortable ear padding for those all day weekend gaming session cool neon lights power indicator surprisingly crisp killer sound clarity and volume comparable to those found on premium gaming headset all for fraction of the cost will purchase many more as xmas presents for the nephews thank you bengoo for the affordable rop notched products 
positive,decent if you like simple mouse cool lights as well 
neutral,this is by far my favorite mouse can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse goes to sleep saving me bit in new batteries if didn notice the mouse sliding off the laptop and onto the chair laser up would be changing the batteries frequently this one recharges no batteries to buy 
negative,well thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them however not only do they not maintain charge while turned off literally have to charge both after one dies and it not like these things last that long so that pathetic but also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting the mouse still will just flash red and not work got rd to replace the nd but that one was just as bad they are all bad this is waste of money you re better off dealing with batteries than these cheap wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway please don buy because you will be happy with it right until the return window closes 
neutral,hard to install gave up on its use 
positive,it is great product much larger then the flip from jbl about times the size
positive,great product and powerful sound easy to use and very portable recommend getting hard case for it 
positive,great keyboard for everyday use led nice brite only wish it would stay on longer or on all the time otherwise great keyboard
positive,first one received only lasted one week but the return process was quick do really like the second one mainly because of the lights know shallow right 
neutral,i got the mouse but the charging cable sent was type charging cable so it wont fit into the mouse to charge 
positive,inexpensive love the changing of colored lights
positive,i love my new keyboard like how it turns off when not in use and is wireless and does not need battery 
neutral,dam this is loudspeaker
positive,easy to pair and stays charged for hours bought it for gardening the back deck and beach trips some other reviewers are disappointed in sound quality but for the price it really great deal have no complaints about the sound wasn expecting sound for listen to wide variety of genres and can fault this speaker 
positive,for the price this mouse is quite good top of the mouse is soft touch material it is comfortable to use not too big or small also like color of the light that always changes while am using the mouse am using this mouse for months my daughter have not broken it yet lol 
positive,just waited long enough so that the return policy wore out fantastic regardless of that the mouse is smooth to hold and enjoyed using it for the little time got to use it make sure to test the charging port if you buy it
positive,this keyboard fit what needed for my gaming chats its so awesome bought one for birthday gift for friend he loves it too 
neutral,originally not happy couldn get the speaker to work my grandson was so disappointed after trying several different things we finally got the speaker to work and my grandson is gaming with his friends definitely worth the money 
positive,loved this mouse and the battery last pretty long
positive,both worked for month both are having issues now one won charge the other is having connection issues
positive,the mouse is slim which is nice it seems to be made of thinner plastic which feels flimsy but over all it pretty good for the price
neutral,sound quality is surprisingly good just make sure you have the front facing you the battery lasts long time and the quality doesn turn to gsrbage when you turn the volume up this product is expensive but you get what you pay for 
positive,great
positive,i ve used this for few months it worked great at first it would die on me after few hours of using so was pretty good about plugging it in when wasn using it now it just sometimes straight up doesn work which gets pretty frustrating ll even try to keep the power chord plugged in and turn it off and on again and it still doesn work that is very inconvenient at that point ll just have to turn it off keep it plugged in and take break from whatever doing 
positive,comfortable good sound overall and excellent product for the price 
positive,of left unattended for while sleep mode works fantastic also great for gaming 
neutral,same as described
positive,i have had this mouse for almost months and use it at least hours day haven been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging but in the time have had it have only had to charge it times and was able to continue to use it while charging do use it for gaming but my games don require fast and accurate like rpg etc so can say yes it does gaming for me but unsure about speed games pros it slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it not ergonomically built and it fits nicely in my carry case the colors are soothing you have options for either standard usb or usb for chargingthe cons the on off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole you need nails or stylus to turn it on the sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it skates over the pad good shake usually gets it right all in all it priced reasonably for what you get update like everyone else just few days past the day return cutoff my mouse also died no power wouldn charge dead contacted the manufacturer mototo inc and they said they have year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out new one 
positive,doesn stay connected hard to tell when charged has to be charged constantly which negates the convenience of cordless it looks cute and feels good but obviously cheap plastic am returning it to buy different mouse with better performance that uses battery so does not need to be hooked up to usb port and charged constantly fyi on seller emailed me and wanted me to remove the review they say they are switching manufacturers let the buyer beware 
positive,just literally snap in usb and go easy to hold light weight lights up perfect all around design quality is excellent just what needed in mouse 
positive,but wish the mic was on swivel like turtle beach but can beat it for price 
positive,i bought it couple of weeks ago and couldn be happier so far just have to charge it one time per week because the battery life is excellent it loud and powerful obsessed with my white choice aesthetically it very cool 
positive,got these for my son for christmas and they worked great now it march and they aren working at all 
positive,i was scared to purchase this speaker so glad did the this speaker works great sounds great 
positive,i love the speaker but it didn come with usb cable like the description says nor did it have the manual the only thing got in the box was the speaker and that it 
positive,perfect for child for gaming and sound quality great price
neutral,no sound and hard to talk
positive,got it for xbox they re pretty decent for the price sound quality it great along with noise cancelling only thing didn like is that in order for the lights to work it has to be plugged in usb 
neutral,would not recommend at all it has not been holding charge for us at all the only way we get it to play is if we charge it fully and then leave it plugged in while it on it also cuts out very frequently and we have my phone sometimes sitting right next to the speaker the sounds quality when it works is good but that only maybe of the time 
neutral,dont work with ps to good and not for kkds the mic will break off if you drop it or hit it when its out no flexibility
positive,my grandson wears those headphones while on his ps and xbox he pro at it now and loves them they were birthday gift and he tore them right out the box it made his day 
neutral,nothing
negative,stop working after month or so idk why people can hear me but cant hear them bought july stop working september if looking at this buy astro instead
positive,i love the sound quality the portability and the color
neutral,i ve had this for month and half it stopped working ve tried charging repeatedly and it does nothing 
positive,shipping was fast and loved the leds but today after week it stopped working figured it needed charge it now been connected to my laptop for over three hours and the blue light has gone off which is supposed to mean is all charged and ready to go but when disconnect it nothing dead guess the low price was giveaway should have paid more attention to 
positive,they keyboard works fine able to maintain connection and battery life is fine the spring or what ever is supporting the space bar can be improved feels very weak and need to make sure space bar is pressed in certain area for it to register command this is fine for web browsing or working on word documents however this can be burdensome when playing games
negative,i bought this mouse for college and received it promptly opened the package and plugged it into my computer and it worked kinda the next morning tried to use it in class and it would not work thought maybe that this mouse was dead so charged it and it will not charge and will not work this mouse is terrible product do not buy 
positive,great will buy second one
positive,simply put it is great mouse for what it worth however had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the usb adapter that comes with the product have ports the manual grammar is terrible btw tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them none of them worked which was bummer then tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away the adapter they provide you is just useless so if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook you should get separate adapter once connected it though it seemed to work perfectly smooth tracking silent clicks and the rgb lighting is beautiful just got it today so hopefully it will keep working the way they claim it should work 
positive,i love how cute this mouse is use it for work it goes into sleep mode pretty quickly but one click and you re back up and running charge it once week 
positive,love this mouse it has sleek design and works wonderful love the quietness and the perfect fit for my small hands 
positive,likes no noise click lights look cool chargeabledislikes chargeable battery life is very short had to turn off every time don use it or else battery runs out super fast within days after months the charging outlet is broken there no way to fix it now can use it anymore safer to go back to traditional battery mouse which lasts for long time 
positive,i bought this for my daughter who is science teacher and is on her feet teaching lot the portability of this keyboard and the fun colors has helped her keep pace with her middle school age students keep them engaged and keep some of the fun in learning

neutral,it states that it has usbc converter but it does not work
positive,works and the battery lasts week or two with frequent use and charges easily one less cord to get snarled in my laptop case too the lights around the edge seem silly but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark goes to sleep after few minutes of nonuse requires mouse click to wake it up nuisance but that means you need not bother to turn it off overall very pleased 
positive,love it
positive,for me you had to have the headphone jack in certain spot and stay still for the sound to stay on it works only sometimes but the more you move the more it cuts out but the sound was very clear and my party could hear me clear when it did work 
neutral,lightweight and for this price is good for gaming

positive,i bought this mouse for work it was great at first it supposedly rechargeable was able to charge it once fine it died again days later and now won charge or turn on ve tried different cords blocks and outlets so confident the problem is the mouse this is useless 
positive, haven had this mouse for more than week and the left click is already broken it won snap back into place loved the mouse in the beginning which made me order replacement hopefully this one doesn let me down 
positive,previously drop mouse by accident and found right button is disable comment to seller and they were so generous to offer refund although merchandise has been used for sometimes compliments and respect to their excellent customer service and business attitude support their product again in future 
positive,i bought these for my year old daughter she has place to put them away safely and is great with taking care of her stuff today she went to plug these into her tablet th use and the headphone plug pulled out of the cord very disappointed in the quality
neutral,i could only hear on one side of the headset but everything else works 
negative,i love this keyboard and it works looks great but warning to anyone else with small hands it little hard to use find myself having to stretch quite bit and hit the wrong keys much more frequently than with other keyboards 
positive,super comfy and cool but get disconnected easily 
positive,works very well with my desk top computer don play games 
negative,upon unpackaging the item everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow however after coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding charge the light would turn on indicating that it was charging and couple of minutes later the light was off told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so left it on to charge for couple of hours unfortunately the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this ergonomic design and lighting is great but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose star 
negative,this mouse only stayed charged for hours if that long not very helpful when working hours day 
positive,works wonderful son jumps up and down lot while playing so the extra length cord is great 
positive,i wish could hear myself in my headphones but beyond that great for the price sound quality is good not great and mic is clear
neutral,everything is precisely as advertised which is what needed for working from home this keyboard was purchased to help keep me from slouching over my laptop key which is smaller and doesn tilt up
positive,sound qualty is excellent pairing very easy 
positive,i bought for my daughter and she loves it 
neutral,lasted one day 
positive,i really enjoyed this headset when need another one this one will buy
positive,for the price realized could have gotten something lot better it cheaply made glitches even with full charge got the white one and wish would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it it does the job still all considering just think it value is overestimated 
positive,these units do not last and customer service is non existent unit was working fine then charged it and nothing zero sound and factory reset does nothing wrote email no response called factory support and no working telephone kind of hard to get warranty when no one is home this is the nd one to do this won be third 
positive,i love how the headset has great sound quality my only gripe is that the leds only work if you plug it into usb port but still very good product for little bit of money
positive,best speaker ve ever put money into that worth it 
positive,quality was great haven had any issues and it durable
neutral,i bought this for my son birthday feb th less then month of using it they are broke can return waste of money save your money and put it towards better quality 
positive,depending on what you want like in gaming keyboard this keyboard fits in well my husband loves it and have seen an improvement in his gaming it also has nice authestic with the lights the lights do not get crazy bright but are bright enough to notice and creates an atmosphere 
positive,i love this thing the sound quality is good for the size and it very portable obviously you can just max the volume on it and your phone it gets distorted like anything else for the price pay this is absolutely worth it use this mainly in the bathroom while showering since it beats phone music out of the water even carry it to the garage and place it and jam out while working on my car considering getting another one of these for family member 
positive,then it continued to be cheap piece of junk mean should have known from the price it was to good to be true never got it to charge or do anything returned 
positive,this is great mouse to have if you are trying to have mouse that can be used on type only device while keeping the option of normal usb open love having it light up and it cool thing to have in my office if you want to use the type port it will need to be attached via adapter the adapter will stick out unfortunately so be careful as you can damage the adapter it does have slot so you can install the dongle not the adapter to the mouse itself the default plug is just normal usb port the mouse feels pretty nice it does feels pretty smooth there is no real lag or drifting with this mouse it does have built in battery which is super nice you are able to just recharge the mouse by plugging it directly into your laptop via micro usb was able to use it for quite some time before the battery died and initial charging only took about hours it does have sleep mode from what can tell to save battery life when you are not using it but it does have an on and off button if you need it the mouse moves pretty well across most surfaces and clicking is pretty responsive im not gamer so can give any recommendations on that the led light works pretty well with the color you can adjust the color via the center button the bottom has pads but they are not the soft silicone like pads it feels like hard material this is plug in play and works great with mac and pc it does not look like it has way of adjusting the dpi but it has pretty good default dpi already so do not see the need to adjust it overall think this is great mouse 
positive,very satisfying to use and look at but after couple months the scroll wheel started being super rough and squeaky good value though 
neutral,mic has some echo jack seems loose in controller my experience they sounds ok if you don need microphone
positive,ergonomically it nice little clickier than expected the lights aren as bright as expected and the charge seems to be not very long had it unplugged for about an hour and not constantly typing and just had to plug it in as it seemed to be not registering keystrokes feel paid way too much
positive,well am not gamer but am coder and was looking for good keyboard tried variety of them but this one is the best its ideal for typing and the light does not pinch you eyes in the dark it has the option to adjust the brightness level and you change the colors according to your need all in all love it and would recommend it 
neutral,already stopped working exactly after the return window closed 
neutral,the cord is well made and looks sturdy
positive,i have played valorant for about year now and couldn hear important stuff like foot steps now can also now have good mic for coms so my teammates can hear me much better 
positive,very confortable headset with great sound quality 
negative,i bought this as gift so unfortunately it wasn opened until after the return window but it only worked for day led background lights work of the time and it will not charge save your time and money and do not buy this product 
positive,perfect and great product 
neutral,mouse was working fine for about week now the middle button to scroll stop working
neutral,this item did not work from the very beginning sent it back will not purchase from this company again 
positive,very comfortable and feels great
neutral,i have this mouse for days and now it just doesn charge no idea why and ve tried everything do not buy it cheap 
neutral,it very lightweight but feels relatively solid no issues after weeks 
neutral,don buy this you have to charge it every day you might as well have mouse with cord because that what it ends up being it does not take battery and hass to be charged all the time 
neutral,i absolutely loved this key board but after months it doesn work thought the battery died but plugged it in and it still won turn back on 
neutral,this is cheap product don buy it
positive,my son loves them so much the color is so bright when they light up and he says it like having surround set up all to himself plus they appear to be made well and fairly durable which is great for my ten year old boy 
negative,sorry usually dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake it started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked now am using brand new macbook so maybe it the usb converter that might be problem but currently not fan 
positive,great comfort and fit 
positive,we have two other smaller jbl speakers flip which we really liked but wanted bit larger one to connect to those to have full stereo effect and we re not disappointed in fact this one took over the top fav spot above the flip good sound good battery stamina good size 
positive,as far as portable bt speakers go it does the job music comes out sounds pretty clear and is loud enough for small outdoor area keep of these by the pool on each side and link them together with stereo sound good way to have music in the pool area without having to wire speakers and such thinking about getting more in order to cover more area but these will do for now 
positive,this is very nice keyboard and of good quality there was no issue getting my pc to recognize it once plugged in the usb adapter one annoying thing about the keyboard is that the background light turns off after about seconds get that this is probably to preserve battery life but in dark environment such at nighttime or for gaming it hard to find the characters on the keyboard when the background light is turned off it would have been nice if there was an option to leave the background lights on while the computer is on or have them turn off after seconds of inactivity would have given this keyboard much higher rating if it weren for this 
neutral,very laggy ended up buying different one no matter what did had to reset it every minutes because it was so laggy 
positive,sounds great good value
positive,it sounds great good quality loooove it
positive,looks good works well
positive,this is the best mouse and love that it is rechargeable haven had lag problem unlike mouse that requires batteries loved it so much bought another

neutral,great mouse for price thought it was bluetooth but its not still good though
positive,we are really enjoying this speaker the connectivity and sound are great 
positive,love this new mouse work from home for my job still and use my mouse all day everyday was originally using big bulky gaming mouse it lights up and looked cool for the last years but now my hand is starting to hurt and was ready to downgrade to something smaller and lighter saw this and had to see what it was about let me tell you love this new mouse its so small and light and easy to use the clicks are super quiet and feels so great in the hand yes it is plastic but it actually doesn feel cheap and feels like good build it very responsive and glides very smooth the only gripe is to wake of up from sleep you have to click the mouse button instead of just moving it like most items but that very minor issue oh and the different colors it comes in is nice also the rgb color changing lighting is very nice effect definitely recommend this mouse for home or office use 
positive,it lights up very pretty but is very laggy doesn track very good with cursor can deal with that since use mine for work so switched back to the mouse my company sent me 
positive,bought it for my son to use on his xbox one he loves it works perfectly
positive,my son loves the headset 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse it so quiet and love the different color lights as use it sal like how comfortable it is to use would definitely recommend this to everyone 
positive,i wasn expecting much heading into my time with bengoo gaming headset after all it costs around and is made by relatively unproven brand surely it can beat the likes of astro steelseries turtle beach and the like right nope it can but what you do get is surprisingly solid pair of cans for your gaming needs the bengoo is an over ear headset featuring inline volume control flip boom microphone and non customizable blue led lights it looks the part it plays for those who like something bit flashy looking though personally was never fan of the sharp pointy edges that mainstream gaming accessories tend to sport 
positive,this product feels nice and looks nice sound quality isn top top tier but it got lot of bang for its buck it great purchase 
positive,very happy with this purchase and delivery
neutral,second one same issue the mouse wheel just stops working do not order this product learn from my mistakes 
positive,great sound
neutral,tru
negative,after one month and days it stopped turning on work fine until it just stop left it charging for hours still no luck 
neutral,the mouse worked fine for the few minutes got to use it the usb charging cord was missing per the instructions you cannot use any other charging cord with it 
positive,i upgraded to the charge and must say the charge sounds way better thinking about returning my charge in favor of the charge due to it not being stereo speaker but mono like everyone is saying also the charge has crisper sound 
positive,this is nice size mouse and love the color and lights you have to charge it overnight if you use it all day like do for work 
neutral,a dependable mouse for regular use not gaming thank you for smooth transaction 
positive,great product purchased for my child to use for gaming
positive,it works great with lighting up clicking speed the scroll doesn work to move the screen up and down 
negative,the mouse is already broken after little over month waste of money the wheel no longer works smh
positive,i have of the jbl go bluetooth speakers that produce tremendous sound quality for such small unit and the portability is the reason bought them recently decided to upgrade to the charge and must say am truly amazed by the incredibly powerful sound quality of this unit don wait buy it today 
positive,sounds great and plays for long time easy setup too 
neutral,ears are too small mute doesn work mic too far from face to pick up clearly
negative,broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the amazon return policy on electronics have tendency to buy it and leave it sitting in the box for way too long bad me because this is the second or third time ve gotten burned on crap like this 
neutral,i bought this keyboard for my everyday use and like it the back lighting is cool but suddenly the print on the keys is smearing and rubbing off to be clear my nails are very long and my fingerpads have never actually touched the keys it is so odd that the print is smearing 
positive,l ds are sick am having trouble figuring out the hearing but figure it out easily enoughsuper easy to figure out though
positive,love this remote the slim design fits perfectly in my hand love the changing rainbow colors and the ease of using is absolutely awesome would highly recommend this remote to anyone with pc mac laptop
neutral,the sound is not that great it sounds like my jbl flip 
neutral,the only thing that annoyed me is that it all plastic which means you need to be careful more the rest is perfection 
positive,easy to use and function sleek easy to handle design don know about family but good for office work 
positive,the color is spot on it is ergonomic and more flat than arched sometimes think it is too wide but yet it not the price was right the color choices were great overall happy that found this mouse it was for my apple laptop as it didn have one and hated not having mouse to navigate
neutral,it only played for hours today at the beach was so disappointedespecially after it says it runs hoursthat lie
positive,great product excellent sound 
positive,this little guy is amazing take it everywhere very durable worth the extra money awesome sound quality 
positive,matte finish is nice keyboard feels of good quality leds are only on when in use goes to sleep after seconds or so very quiet great packaging and it comes with cool stickers 
positive,my boyfriend got me this as gift to help with my crafting love this color because it goes with my cricut also loved that it came with an adapter for my macbook air these newer macbooks require adapters for anything that is not charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is amazing don have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use love it thank you so much for thinking of us apple users 
positive,fantastic sounds great and perfect size 
positive,initially my preference was the bose soundlink mini ii with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in small transportable package that is until heard comparison against jbl charge on youtube based on that review and others purchased this speaker for its waterproof multi connect and sound great price you can buy charge direct from jbl for with color options with price point being on par with amazon sounds great excellent better describes it if you have charge there isn enough improvement to justify buying charge the charge went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from hz to deeper hz when the jbl arrived we conducted our own comparison against bose soundlink mini ii and wow the charge is much clearer has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room it bit larger and heavier than the soundlink mini ii which might turn some off but to me if going to carry any speaker like this then taking the same care and am sure can find just little more room good packaging but no instructions not that charging and setup are all that difficult but this is my first device that requires usb first anything that arrived with zero printed information and rechargeable device that arrived with zero anything to charge it with setup was easy bought usb cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for hours since it came somewhat charged already once charged press the bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device for settings always recommend phone volume to be no more than to volume then using the charge volume from there this affords you plenty of up down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn task the internal sound processor this since it cheaper to replace repair charge than an expensive smartphone you and someone else can be bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time battery life the built in rechargeable li ion mah battery is strong not only does it support up to hours of playtime at lowest setting and figure hours at half volume but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the usb port strongly suggest buying protective case for it which will hold your charger usb charging cable and any spare usb cable needed for cell phones it has the same ipx waterproof as iphone samsung or other higher end smartphone we place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills big splashes being left in the rain or even an accidental swim in the pool having that peace of mind alone is priceless jbl connect with connect you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience put in opposing corners of large room in different rooms indoor and outdoors heck even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap bottom line this being my first bluetooth speaker ever and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs bang for buck is spot on have excellent sound in transportable package in wireless speaker that is rugged waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect now proudly own the party favorite speaker for socials events and private enjoyment win 
positive,the style is nice and the sound quality is great 
neutral,that really good quality and battery life

positive,sleek and very kewl low profile and easy on the hands very satisfied with my product 
positive,this mouse has become my new best friend have arthritis which has severely affected my hands its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage the mouse is absolutely quiet as promised plus is easily used without huge amount of pressure from my fingers hand or wrist the mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations my hands are grateful and so am another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsonce charged the battery is good for quite few days do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily and sometimes more have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for eight days actually it was still working but had become bit slow to react rather than wait for it to quit completely charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week am very glad chose to try this mouse my next purchase of mouse if or when needed will be repeat of this one in different color this is an unpaid and unsolicited review from grateful owner

positive,headphones were excellent for my gaming needs sound and mic quality were very impressive 
neutral,i liked the look feel and price of this mouse however after less than months of moderate use while playing game clicked the wheel and it broke this item was not made to last cheap and not worth the money in my opinion 
positive,i very comfortable ergonomically feel internal rechargeable batteries and instant connection while setting up for the first time took less than seconds from taking it out of the box to working the button press is also really smooth and doesn feel like hard click the roller knob at the top is fairly smooth and the transitional led lighting looks really good very happy with this purchase
positive,pretty good mouse for when do school work
neutral,the mouse works great except the right button doesn always copy paste on various web pages after receiving the new mouse the problem is the web page design because the same problem occurs tried different brand mouse with the same result 
positive,arrived just like the picture lights aren as bright but they re pretty either way good sound haven tested mic yet
neutral,i needed small mouse for travel it working well it has dpi settings which haven explored yet not crazy about it being rechargeable prefer batteries but the rechargeable battery likely makes it lighter and smaller 
neutral,appearance size with built in charging 
neutral,when first got this item it worked fine but after couple of weeks it was not moving the arrow very well dropped it once and it stopped working altogether 
positive, update still liking the keyboard after months of daily use my only two issues are the button location is terrible am mostly used to it at this point but still accidentally press instead of enter all the time although the battery life is good there is no indicator for low battery this means the keyboard will just unexpectedly stop in the middle of typing when it dead have been using this keyboard daily for the past three weeks use it about hrs day during the work week and have had to charge it twice since getting it pretty good it is by no means silent keyboard but it is much quieter than my previous keyboard and is not disruptive to my office mate husband am reasonably fast typer wpm and the keyboard is responsive don expect it to blow your mind but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality you are getting for less than 
positive,it is pretty good gaming headphone no problem at all
positive,wish the keyboard and letters were better lit only has lighted background
neutral,did not receive the correct cable to charge 
positive,really looks and works great will see how it holds up 
neutral,the product sold to me was used and listed as new 
neutral,stopped working after uses the scrolling wheel isn working update told the company about the issue with my mouse they immediately sent replacement works good lets see if this one lasts
positive,i would have loved this product if my hands weren so picky and plus it was bit too flat for gaming on pc works fine very silent clicks still if you aren used to flat mouse don buy it
neutral,it quit working after days and they wouldn take it back or refund 
neutral,really bummed these seem like really nice headphones but the mic doesn work you can hear fine in them but no one can hear you 
positive,my granddaughter loved them 
positive,works pretty good
positive,speaker was perfect addition to our home whether you re listening to music by the pool out by the garage or in the shower 
positive,stopped working very disappointed was enjoying using the mouse working from home and only used for that purpose charged every days very disappointed the lifespan was short review update on product very happy with the customer service they reached out and provided refund customer service goes long way when you receive services or products having great customer service make you more confident in the company due to nothing is perfect

positive,gaming headset low cost nice colors and perfect fit and the customer service team is great
positive,good wireless mouse portable ergonomic and the size is just right love how it has lights and changing colors 
neutral,first of all the keyboard is very loud not silent at all not even close second the discription claims this keyboard is compatible with xbox one it is not false advertising and loud very other than that it looks nice
neutral,i ordered the head blue cheaper set of head phones with mic the mic does not work for my ps even ordered second one because thought my first set was broken just junk guess
positive,i absolutely loved this mouse it worked great the battery lasted for days and it fit my hand so well only giving it low rating because after month and three days it quit working it will not turn on anymore 
positive,exactly what wanted and expected love the colors 
neutral,i liked the sound overall and that it came with usb port if wanted the leds and two additional headphone ports if one breaks also listen to music with it 
positive,when you speak the mic sounded like was under water wasn clear if your not getting this item for mic recommend it because the hearing aspect of it is great can hear everything it just the mic is poor
positive,i mean this is wireless mouse that has pretty lights and stuff but swear it doesn catch well and have to slide it like pro curler either it dies really fast or it just decides to stop properly working not sure what the true issue is like the texture and how sleek it is but when it doesn properly work it drives me absolutely nuts even got mouse pad and it still gives me issues 
neutral,my husband takes this everywhere he goes even the golf course lol
neutral,i ordered this mouse because was tired of using my laptops track pad at school it arrived on time charges quickly has very satisfying and quiet mouse click sound and overall is great mouse for the price the only issue face is that the rgb on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well it doesn prevent the mouse from doing its job though and often find myself using the mouse with the rgb off anyway overall good mouse just don expect the rgb to work amazingly it is only after all 
neutral,the usb broke off in my computer and had trouble removing it finally got it out with finger nail clippers was happy with it until this happened 
positive,we brought this to the beach with us and we use it outside while we are swimming perfect for us sound is great we love it 
neutral,my laptop has keys that don work so tried to reset it and sign back in the keys still didn work so ordered this key board and got it day later charged it by port cord which didn know was supplied plugged the usb in and didn need to install anything it just worked 
positive,it charged within an hour or two out of the box like the lightweight slim feel of the mouse the storage of the usb clip is secure and pretty easy to get in out while it not important like the changing colors of the lights inside the mouse just fun feature so far it works great for the inexpensive price 
negative,after charging it stopped working so put it back on the charger thinking it wasn fully charged and nope still didn work this was waste of money 
positive,slim and fits comfortably in palm of hand wish that would have purchased sooner 
positive,has great design and excellent features 
positive,i don game so did not find it fair to give it reviews on that factor but this keyboard is great now that am working from home and my days never seem to end this keyboard was just what needed especially for working at night 
positive,my six year old grandaughter is gamer ve been told all know is that these headphones is on her head most of the time see her she prefers this set over two previous pair her parents bought her so grandparents still getting kisses for buying my grandbaby pair she really liked 
positive,the controller on the wire is nice sometimes the wire gets in the way when gaming it takes second to get used to the headphones after you put them on they are nice can comfortable not good at noise cancelling but otherwise they are great 
negative,horrible quality the wheel stopped working only after few hours it is very light and feels very cheap 
neutral,i bought months ago and it stopped working it cheap suggest not buying this 
neutral,when leave the mouse alone for couple of minutes and then start using it the mouse is really slow have trying everything to fix it need new mouse now
neutral,purchased to of these for myself and wife for the price can complain had them for few months as of now still operating fine
positive,sleep mode is non adjustable you cannot use ctrl shift or ctrl alt functions because the keyboard won register simultaneous keystrokes involving ctrl this is the first ever product ve returned the day received it 
positive,awesome for gaming and work
positive,love this speaker can use it anywhere and in multiple ways great buy 
positive,i recently tried to go back to an old pair of headphones and found them to be lacking so opted to buy second pair of these since had used them before and enjoyed them after side by side comparison these headphones are more comfortable have much higher audio quality and overall feel like they have better build quality than other headphones ve used if you re looking for great product that looks good and for lower price than high end ones buy these you certainly won regret it 
positive,perfect quality for all my needs
positive,only bad thing is that you don get to have the lights on your head set but other than that it the best money can buy affordable and quality thanks 
positive,i purchased this mouse for my thinkpad running linux and it worked like charm set up was breeze simply plugged it in and it worked it even works when in the settings this mouse is hard to beat for the price 
positive,its been less than months but the mouse has already popped open and doesn work just wish it would last longer 
positive,my daughter loved the color
neutral,wire is broken within month contacted seller and got refund immediately now they are changing vendor to get good quality wire 
positive,excellent
negative,keep reading reviews that boast about the bass not true at all only provides mid bass and not low pass so it sounds muffled and offbeat when listening to music with very low bass that was important to me and the reviews were misleading 
positive,this mouse works well and is easily rechargeable and portable wouldn recommend using it for gaming but it perfect if you need wireless mouse to take with your laptop 
positive,it great for gaming
positive,this little wireless mouse is awesome the color at night looks amazing love the handle my wife liked it as well that had to buy her one as well thanks for the amazing product
positive,given to wife as gift she loves it 
positive,nice keyboard at this price just make sure your computer is bluetooth compatible for wireless operation 
positive,i love it bought this for my mom because already have one of this brand so know it has really good sound quality the battery lasts for long and you can be using it while charging and the quality still the same really easy to connect to your phone by the way it only takes few seconds hope you enjoy this product as much as we do 
positive,it great product and easy to use and also very portable and reliable
neutral,the cushion material is very uncomfortable after few minutes of wear it feels like your ears get hot quickly it seems it would have been easy to cover foam ear piece with more breathable material sound quality is great and the microphone seems to be perfect but sound quality means absolutely nothing if it is too uncomfortable to wear 
positive,my daughter loved the headphones its comfy and lights turn on when connected to pc works well with her xbox remote also so its win all around
positive,best speaker ve ever bought
positive,great product we use it mostly on our fire tablet and it works great only complaint is that there is not built in storage for the usb adapter 
neutral,how do return it for repair stopped working after only several hours of use see it has year parts and labor but how can get in contact with someone to return it 
neutral,the brand is much cleaner than most products of similar quality 
neutral,good sound quality and lights used for gaming
positive,ive bought headphones from walmart with better sound quality its also apparently designed for babies because cant see anyone else managing to fit their ears in the earcuffs overpriced trash not even worth do not buy now they keep trying to bribe me to delete this review lol what joke
positive,this is great headset my son loves it and uses it on his nintendo switch 
positive,love the colors so far ok
positive,great keyboard for the price love the feel though somehow do feel it isn as hefty when typing than used to some people might like this light feel prefer heavier response when click work from home coder so use it on average minimum hours daily it lasted approx days on single charge not bad at all if you charge it overnight once week you shouldn have any problems with it dying randomly the auto sleep feature is nice to prolong the battery but when working it can be like off putting that the lights go out vs them constantly being on 
neutral,nice feel and looks nice but the scroll wheel works on and off making more advanced tasks difficult 
positive,great speaker it really cranks and totally an impressive item for the price 
positive,works on my macbook air battery life is really good and the mouse feels good and clicks are very satisfying only downside is the adaptor is big and ugly 
neutral,just spend the extra money on mouse that will actually last you more than two uses highly annoyed
positive,amazing for the price and great for casual playing and listening 
neutral,it good
neutral,was good headset while it lasted these lasted for maybe three months before they stopped working 
positive,been looking for good first wireless keyboard that won break the bank and have been pretty satisfied ve used this keyboard for weeks and haven had any issues the keyboard itself is very lightweight as for gaming ve had no issues across multiple games great starter wireless keyboard for the price 
positive,this is very user friendly modle very light weight silent rechargable and easy to move around just one suggestion it will be better if the instruction has english version 
neutral, and on time
positive,great sound very clear love to take it outside while gardening it lightweight and charged quickly 
positive,love these products super good brand
neutral,space bar is loud in feels like it going to fall of and it to small
positive,i got this in the mint green color and like that color the only issue is that it broke in about month so if you really need mouse for your laptop but if you want cheap one then don really recommend this product 
neutral,i like the fact can see the keys at night hate the fact that two out of four receiver stopped working still love the two that working 
neutral,using the type port as its plug in method does not work while plugged in my computer does not detect or accept the plug in if this is your main use in mind do not use it 
positive,i relly like this speaker good sound and pretty clear 
neutral,would ve been really dope if the lights would have worked when plugged it up instead of needing another power source but overall they re decent
neutral,bought this around months ago the advertised range of feet is just not true have the dongle around feet away and the keyboard randomly stops registering keystrokes have to bring the keyboard close to the dongle for it to re register and then sit back down on the couch this might be battery related but then there is no visual indicator of battery levels today though it just completely stopped working doesnt register any keystrokes the keyboard is very light which is nice 
neutral,the mic doesn work after week
neutral,works absinthe in lap top and just to play at work
positive,love
neutral,i ordered this headset back in november and the microphone stopped working in february it was christmas gift for my son and he was only able to use it from january february the headset stopped after only days couldn return it because it was past the return window so ordered another one last week it arrived on and again it defective and the microphone doesn work this is incredibly frustrating that ve had the same problem twice with product that is considered best seller with positive reviews 
positive,my husband and purchased two of these speakers and are thrilled with them the sound quality is fantastic and when they say they are waterproof you can believe it we took one of our speakers out on the boat with us and wouldn you know it passing wake toppled it right into the water we had to turn the boat around to go grab out of the water and the speaker never lost sound nor suffered any damage whatsoever the entire time it was in the water about minutes it never stopped playing the song as it was floating although an unfortunate incident the speakers held up continue to operate and needless to say we highly recommend them 
neutral,only complaint is that when at high volume buzzing can be heard
neutral,it is exactly as pictured works well 
positive,fantastic sound quality and simple to operate it fantastic audio experience in package not much bigger than bottle of water 
positive,great christmas gift
neutral,i only had it for week and it quit charging even tried other charging ports it would not take charge waste of my money
positive, great mouse fits my hand easy to use
positive,works great looks even better 
positive,this speaker has amazing sound quality and is such an upgrade from my phone speaker use it in my home but it is also compact enough to be great for travel taking to the pool the beach and more my only complaint is that the battery life seems little short so often bring little portable charger for it on the go 
positive,great mouse like the colors and how easy it was to connect to my laptop and tablet so can play baldurs gate on my tablet way easier now charging doesn take long at all either some with large hands may not like it to much it is bit smaller
neutral,it lit
negative,this headset stopped working days after return window received them on july stopped working august th do not recommend this product the mic cuts in and out and the sound is full of static 
neutral,good headset
neutral,good sound
positive,stopped working after few days of use on brand new laptop will turn on but does not function properly lags however great the first few days 
positive,the headset works great as far as sound quality and noise control the only down sides are that the cord is too long and the remote control is big big could get in the way 
neutral,randomly stopped working during my work day the keyboard still lights up when you type but it like my computer stopped recognizing it even after plugged it in tried different things found on the web to troubleshoot but still can type when went online saw many many posts of users experiencing the same issue so based on that would not recommend buying this 
neutral,not the greatest but works
positive,i really enjoyed this mouse that arrived so promptly after my first few clicks realized it is the best mouse had ever used for regular writing needs the design color is very stylish too 
neutral,could not get it to work for my son pc missed the return window 
neutral,as described
positive,bought this to replace my old apple mouse it works well holds charge easy to recharge no problems it did take little relearning to use the wheel vs the apple mouse smooth glide system great price too 
neutral,after less than months not only will it not hold charge doesn even work plugged into the laptop don buy 
positive,its sound quality is best 
positive,it is great my brother loved it he used every day and it was great investment great product for christmas gift for the gamers 
neutral,stopped working cant return either 
positive, update this mouse is garbage wrote my review after one day of good functionality but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently buttons don always work when click something if take out the usb and turn on off the mouse it fixes it for few minutes until it goes into sleep mode the first one they sent me didn work at all and this new one just doesn work it works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff ordering something else the mouse works great for my dell laptop fits comfortably sleek profile no problems the button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse had an issue with my first shipment but customer service was very responsive problem solved with me and then shipped me new mouse very quickly 
neutral,wouldnt work with ps
neutral,so far so good although my first impression is that putting the on off switch underneath is stupid lights going off after minute is problematic in the dark unless you really know your touch typing fn pause lights high low or offif reviews are accurate now ll wait to see if got one that lasts 
positive,works great and is easy to connect to 
negative,absolutely nothing is working on this acts like it charged but it not won bluetooth to my computer nothing is working don waste your money 
positive,the speaker battery lasts literally forever and the sound quality is mind blowing honestly any speaker from jbl deserves the praise it gets 
positive,great mouse love the lights when using it 
positive,they feel like cheap plastic and the sound isn that great not fan of the cord either but that personal preference they work if you re looking for cheap headphones and don care edit bought these when they were at least half the price these are not worth dollars
negative,it may be pretty to look at but it requires constant charging no warning when low on charge so if you are in the middle of using your usb port to hear music or watch dvd you have to stop unplug it just to charge the mouse very frustrating going back to batteries 
neutral,stopped working less than hours after received the package it would cost me more to return it than what paid for it so it just sitting in my office making clutter honestly would not recommend it at all 
positive,it got delivered month ago and it has stopped working after using for like the th time it turns on them off immediately it got charge and just won work glad got my invoice since can still write it off as business expense not good product and will not buy again not very pleased with this device 
neutral,stopped working after couple months 
positive,love it
positive, am in love with this mouse its just perfect for the price been using it lot and only need to charge it once really recommend it 
positive,i bought this mouse because needed wireless mouse for work it came in cheap box written in mostly chinese it is nice color and it was easy to setup used this for work for weeks and today went to use it and it stopped working it didn register on the computer am sending this back for refund and ll just get logic tech 
neutral,this is the nd keyboard that won hold charge the st one never did and the replacement unit lasted five weeks until it became an amazon regret purchase just beyond the return time avoid 
positive,small good shape easy to install 
positive,the mouse is nicely shaped and feels nice in your hand the clicking is quiet the only problem is that it does not stay charged more than one day so have to keep it plugged in which defeats the purpose of having wireless mouse 
positive,nice mouse if it worked the first one purchased worked for about month when the scrolling wheel broke the company replaced it free of charge now six months later the second one has quit working won hold charge 
positive,i loved this mouse received it and was able to unbox and set it up within seconds it charges so quickly and its perfect size love it 
positive,great head set
neutral,does not disappoint
neutral,for some reason thought this took batteries but it doesnt it has an on board battery that takes usb to charge no big deal have note and keep charger at my desk got it because its waterproof and work in bar accidents happen haven used that feature yet but ll update if do battery life is good lights look cool but you can turn them off if you want buy again 
positive,it is compact yet gives very powerful sound quality the battery life is also decent like my new charger speaker 
positive,i really loved the size and feel as well as how quiet it was but it only lasted about months before it completely crapped out and never worked again suppose it good short term solution 
positive,quite and really easy to use 
positive,haven had much time to use it yet but like it so far 
positive,it my first gaming headset and it pretty good tbh
neutral,i used it in warehouse while we were assembling christmas food boxes for families in need and it made that christmas music fill the whole warehouse 
positive,good mouse can use for working at home ordered the rose gold which is pretty cute for desk decor and the lights are fun it functions well and it quiet when you click which is great
neutral,just quick note linux compatible out of the box nice mouse
positive,i was looking for mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one am pleasantly surprised by this mouse the click is very quiet yet there is satisfying tactile feel to it though the right click can be bit sensitive but nothing too major think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable very convenient the mouse can be used while charging and only took about hours to fully charge there is led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging the mouse will also go into sleep mode after minutes of inactivity to save power overall great mouse 
positive,really nice rat would definitely recommend it feels great rechargeable cool led colors and wireless 
neutral,not worth the money at all it just standard keyboard that slides all over the place and occasionally lights up missing grips and the lights won stay on longer than seconds which is why wanted it in the first place for when working at night pointless
positive,i liked the sleep mode price is reasonable also liked the shape 
neutral,smooth clicking ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use 
neutral,looked cool but it broke within the first couple hours of use too late to return it so guess have to just eat my investment 
neutral,i don like it
neutral,the headset actually works 
neutral,the wheel from the mouse not working anymore it only lasted for about months really nice mouse but doesn last 
neutral,not practical for me fir everyday use
positive,complete junk never worked don waste your money because it pretty
positive, it good mouse led good im still trying learn how it works but so far so good for now
positive,greatest decision made selecting portable speaker you will not be disappointed please purchase 
positive,they fit very well and have amazing sound quality very long cord as well recommend ton 
neutral,this headset is ok for little kid for gaming or for someone starting out the sound quality is not the best this headset is meant for pc system and for console system 
positive,this mouse saves ton in cost of batteries because it is rechargeable it fits the palm of my hand very comfortably well worth the cost 
positive,best little speaker definitely recommend 
neutral,i got this less and two months ago and loved it until today when it broke when touched the wheel 
neutral,good for the price tracks kind of poorly and the led colors are not great
positive,works like charm
negative,im so mad my keyboard is broken in some letters and numbers and don know if you sent me the quality keyboard am very disappointed with your keyboard used days it is very good and after that it was damaged hope you read this comment then refund me
neutral,this mouse was driving me crazy at first in that thought it wasn working but it had gone into its sleep mode just give it click to wake it up now that know that it works great go figure user error 
neutral,super unresponsive fun idea but would not recommend to anyone 
positive,these are super lightweight headphones with good audio and microphone input the wire is very long and durable as well controls on the wire work plugs are covered with plastic cover for protection and it comes with the adapter for pc use love the pink color very nice and pastel the lights add nice flare to it as well although they only stay one color and don change padding is comfortable and does not make the headphones feel so heavy and tight on my head the material is like hard plastic for the overall headphone and controls like it lot recommend getting these headphones 
neutral,didn realize until the unboxing that in order for the lights to work need usb not super big issue it was gift for my son birthday he likes them very much
neutral,after using this as an everyday keyboard for six months now there are few problems with even with full charge the keyboard will randomly power off have missed keystrokes and there no way to tell how much charge is left in the battery it is quiet however but wouldn use it as an everyday keyboard 
positive,perfect little speaker jam around the house with it or take it with you wherever battery will last me days and this thing even has bass perfect for my fishing trips or camping trips 
neutral,i would give it no stars if could 
positive,with teenagers its hard to buy expensive equipment knowing how it will be treated but the price of these headphones was good for the value my son is very happy with them and they didn put huge hole in budget 
positive,i happy with this purchase love the look of the headphones and enjoy the lights even though can really see them myself enjoy the fact that they are there and that people that walk into the room can see them the headphones work great nice sound quality good purchase 
neutral,this mouse did not work the wireless receiver did work so the mouse did not connect to my laptop 
neutral,a little after month the connection where the wire meets the plug for the controller went bad now the headset is useless do yourself favor and get either wireless or better made headset 
neutral,the type receiver doesn work do noy buy 
negative,i ordered for work and for home they are great until died after months it indicated that it is charged but it does not function it might be bad switch they second died in less than months of use disposable batteries would be better for the environment than disposing of multiple rechargeable that stop working faster than battery runs out 
positive,i bought this product to use in my art studio but bring it outside all the time the sound quality is great would buy another one if they can be linked 
neutral,it works and it nice but the led are quite dim 
neutral,this stopped functioning after one week of use 
neutral,good mouse
neutral,i returned it sounded like bad day on am radio did not keep it long enough to test battery life returned it the next day 
negative,didn realize that there wasn place to put battery in so it always had to be charged after two or three weeks could no longer charge it and could not have it work cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long term or if you spend lot of time on the computer
neutral,the metal casing for the usb remote came off and is now stuck in the usb port of my computer
neutral,it doesn charge anymore 
neutral,this mouse does what it needs for the most part however the cursor itself will jump all over the page from time to time which is annoying 
neutral,just as advertised 
positive,this product is really good for gaming and the sound quality is so good really like the volume button too 
neutral,nice enough keyboard for the price but not really quiet which is one of the main reasons purchased 
neutral,order met his expectations
negative,the usb receiver got stuck in my laptop usb port ended up having to get it out with pliers fortunately this didnt cause any damage to the usb port very disappointed in this product as the keyboard no longer works at all and it almost damaged my laptop the usb receiver came out in pieces at time and not sure if it even functioned properly to begin with it most definitely doesn function now 
positive,note ve owned these for over six months shopped for bluetooth speakers bose pricing is insane jbl had the charge the charge on amazon the charge models seemed to be very similar based on the item description so went with this charge it was less expensive glad did don use this often but every time do surprised by the sound quality sounds great the batteries last for long time sometimes have bit of difficulty switching from macbook streaming to iphone streaming or vice versa but sure it operator error regardless it can be done and quite satisfied with the purchase these are great by the pool in the summertime 
neutral,unfortunately was in hurry when bought this and didn take the time to read the other reviews hopefully you re taking the time to read them got it and it never even turned on made sure was doing everything right and even got my dad to look too but it wouldn charge the light would turn on when plugged it in for few minutes and then turn off it looks like other people had this issue but few weeks into using it so at least it broke in time for me to return still hassle
positive,it sooo pretty and very easy to use just as described online highly recommend love rose gold 
neutral,i work from home and have to run more than one screen and this mouse was amazing when bought it now it has decided that it doesn want to charge and is currently useless after only week was about to buy another one for my mom but have canceled it now since this one has stopped working it sucks because it such fun mouse it also never leaves my home office so know it not from packing or moving it around lot
positive,really like this speaker use it in my house and outside and the sound is great love that it waterproof resistant or whatever because use it on shelf above my shower and don have to worry about the steam ruining it 
neutral,this thing literally started skipping after minutes of use
positive,don get me wrong do like this mouse it smooth pretty easy to use and overall pretty great but and this is strong but if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it or my dog or even me it could be super light and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over it really annoying 
positive,it was working fine until one day it would not connect to my computer reached out to support and they were able to send me new one without question they provided the perfect support in the time frame needed 
neutral,i have used these now ever since received them and they are very comfortable wear glasses so usually the earmuffs can be uncomfortable after about minutes of use not with these have had no issues wearing them for hours on end 
neutral,very slim stays charged for long time
neutral,the poor reviews are sometimes exaggerated but the one read is correct my hearing isn what it used to be when waa younger listened to some very wonderful equipment owned by me and some friends my experience includes used to playing the saxophone and other musical instruments can recognize when music and or voices are not in tune have even been accused of perfect pitch with that said can say that the charge is horrible reproducer of sound own four jbl flip speakers and they do great job for their size however the charge has sound profile of loud but muddied bass hollow sounding mids and really poor attempt at the highs tinny sounding like listening to an old am only transistor radio the flip is so much better especially in pairs owning allows me to have two fully charged until the other pair is discharged bought single charge for an anticipated abusive future will be moving soon and as put things in storage and load trucks and trailers wanted something that if damaged it wouldn break up my set of four thought the other reviewer may have received lemon ithought there is no possible way jbl would send out mono speaker especially if the sound is not centered the sound is centered about two inches from center it is very annoying to me outside moving my belongings would be make this design flaw less noticible to imperceptible will return this and get something else 
positive,excellent quality for the price
positive,these are really good headphones for the price they work for my kids great got them each pair and they really like them used them for an evening of fortnite and the sound was clear and it seemed to me everyone could understand me fine 
neutral,i bought one and the piece going into my laptop didn work the second broke easily 
positive,just like the title says died out of nowhere days after the return window and warranty were up tired it on two pcs and one laptop it still lights up but won connect junk 
neutral,these worked great for month we received them on june nd and they stopped working by august th was attempting to contact the seller and can not for any reason get in touch with them do not buy 
neutral,charge only lasts short time then stops typing plug it in and stops typing when charged tested on other systems and nothing changed
positive,update had it charging for less than minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic in that time the cord got super hot and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well probably would have caught fire if left unattended update using different cords was just fine do not use the cord that comes with it update battery won hold charge was really wanting this mouse to work but looks like returning it after all 
positive,wished the keyboard was brigther but all is good 
positive,i got this mouse for friend and he loved it very sleek and the colors just overall look amazing awesome purchase 
positive,i love this mouse it works well with my laptop it changes colors with music wasn expecting that but it is bonus it also changes color with the speakers purchased defiantly would recommend this product 
positive,works great
positive,my son loves his new headset shipping was almost overnight thanks 
positive,it is great
positive, just live my cordless keyboard and mouse they match my hp desktop computer perfectly 
positive,fast shipped love it the keyboard works great 
neutral,only the microphone jack worked for me it comes with splitter but that did not fix the issue again do not buy this product for pc 
positive,love it for my work from home job very ergonomic and smooth 
positive,i type fast don know how many words minute but it fast this silly thing won keep up with me have to constantly stop and backspace to retype it pretty good battery life but if you type fast you might want to look elsewhere
positive,i did lot of research on amazon looking for new cheaper gaming headset for my son he seems to have the worst luck when it comes to cheaper gaming headsets but guess you get what you pay for however with these they work great sound quality is good voice and mute work good the lights do not light up unless you have the usb cord connected to another source my son uses his for the ps so no lights for us doesn really matter though since he cannot see the lights anyway they work and that what matters most the extra connector does come in the box 
positive,awesome and cool the color turns red when it time to plug in and recharge 
negative,i was very excited about this keyboard but unfortunately it has been very bad experience in general it is as presented in the advertisement but after using it for minutes it stops working completely even when it is turned on tried reinstalling the drivers changing the usb port and trying it with another computer but did not get good results it does not work after few minutes am very disappointed that wasted my money on this product 
positive,perfect
positive,i bought this product in november by december the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped ll admit liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again here we are in february and the same exact thing has happened again used this mouse for my work computer in the office and certainly don aggressively use the scroll wheel yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units both within the first weeks of use ve never had mouse break apart like this before so have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together suppose you get what you pay for shame because aesthetically it is very nice will never buy this product again would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away pay few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than few weeks side note look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review rolls eyes perhaps ll just copy and paste their request here for the rest of you to read ha
positive,first let me say that this jbl portable speaker isn toy this has weight to back up the power sound it brings so if your looking to bring your party anywhere this speaker will bring it it also waterproof but don recommend anyone taking there party to the shower sound check 
positive,so for anyone wondering charging it is easy if you plug it and the light in the middle is blue that means that it is not fully charged the blue light will turn off after being fully charged mine arrived on monday and on wednesday it turned off plugged it in and took around hours to charge it the light turned off the clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use one thing do not like is the scroller which can be little too hard tend to open many tabs at once at work and while am on pinterest lol but that just me overall is nice mouse and hope it can stay with me forever this is my th mouse in less than year 
positive,the click wheel stopped working two days after the return window the colors are pretty it fun mouse but pretty basic would not buy this again
positive,love my jbl they make awesome speakers for any occasions take it everywhere and battery life last hours some 
positive,it works great love it my son uses it aswell for roblox
neutral,some keys stopped working months of use contacted the klim for assistance and was not able to get the keyboard exchanged for new one will no longer purchase any electronics from klim 
positive,i have been using the keyboard for several months now for occasional gaming absolutley love how quiet it is the connection is very easy battery life long have only charged it once and very comfortable to use wish the backlight stayed on longer though just bought another klim keyboard for work 
positive,the headset itself is great but the chord is extremely long and to get the lights to work it has seperate usb so wouldn recommend for console 
positive,loved them
positive,i love this speaker use it in my home gym sound quality is great 
neutral,the keys start to fade and you can see the letters numbers after repeated use 
neutral,i gave it two stars because like glowing lights can you tell child of the if could give it zero stars for function would this mouse has lot of good reviews maybe mine is fluke it is however fairly horrible the charge on the battery is extraordinarily short lived and when charged it sort of sucks then too 
negative,sux stopped working after month of use will not charge 
positive,these are great economical headphones for kids bought sets one for each of my kids they use them for remote school as well as gaming have heard no complaints about them 
neutral,the year warranty reeled me in unfortunately needed the key feature to work and neither the light indicator nor the key functions worked it also had initial charging issues it took days to charge then it was charging but not for very long hrs cs said the only option was to exchange so did the exchange charged right away but the key caps indicator didn work the key functions didn work either the cs on the exchange told me that could have just returned it the first time and not go through the exchange process that process turnaround time was couple of weeks lost spend more money and get better keyboard one with established reviews track record in this case year warranty was marketing only because the keyboard never performed at 
neutral,it is handy keyboard
positive,mouse works well and is good value for the inexpensive price 
positive,this headset it looks so pretty love the color along the pink light when plugged in however bought this headset for my work from home job meaning need the mic performed mic test and discovered that the mic doesn work disabled the built in mic on my hp pc to ensure sound was coming solely from the headset mic heard low scratchy version of my voice gave stars bc music sounds great in the headphones and it feels high quality returning them bc the mic is about inches of trash 
positive,headset does excellent job of noise canceling and the sound quality is great 
positive,very nice bluetooth speaker with powerful bass and clean sound 
neutral,the mouse didn work after the first few hours of use troubleshooting didn work 
neutral,amazon had it in the wireless section and it not wireless in fact there are plenty of long wires to annoy you it sound quality is sound quality as well as not being confortable fit and pain to wear if on for more than minutes easy choice to return and get new one do not buy this 
neutral,good product
neutral,don bother doesn work
positive,the keyboard works wonders love how accurate and speedy it is and how it shuts off when not in use to save power in addition to that klim is such wonderful company with excellent customer service had misplaced my wireless dongle the little black usb piece that is for the keyboard and they were more than happy to send me new one at no extra charge they even included little french candy with my dongle love klim 
positive,i am very disappointed with this item had replaced it once and the same thing happened where it doesn hold charge after few months of ownership really like this product but the cool rainbow changing lights can only be enjoyed when its charged and working properly 
positive,works really great
positive,i love the mute affect
positive,excellent product works right out the box
neutral,i won waste money on these with no batteries ever again junk
neutral,the sound is good but it turns itself on and off all the time had to start keeping in the shed when not using it weird 
positive,works great
positive,great speaker all around this is the second one we have purchased 
positive,great video game headset love how it has the adjustable speak in microphone now players can actually hear me 
neutral,when got this mouse noticed rattling sound when it was plugged up saw that there was piece broken and rattling around on the inside the lights don look good at all returned it 
neutral,didn seem to be that much louder than my flip 
positive,great sound battery lasts all day 
positive,these have been pretty good so far really good deal for the price 
positive,this mouse is very stylish and ergonomic it is very responsive love it 
neutral,not very good quality
neutral,it works fine just seems little cheap and not real comfortable 
neutral,the mouse scrolled only worked for one day then stopped everything else works and lights are very pretty
positive,great product 
negative,a rechargeable cordless mouse is such good idea and invention you don have to deal with batteries and this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over day great this one bought worked well even though it did something odd and am not sure if it was the mouse or the inexpensive tablet computers that use or maybe the usb splitters that use however it was probably the mouse but after using the mouse normally for few hours the mouse would then not show the arrow on the screen and found that would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again it was as if had to re boot the mouse periodically it seemed to have nothing to do with recharging this would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged it would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was minor flaw but then one day actually the date of this writing march put the mouse receiver into different receptacle to use different tablet computer and it would not work no matter what tried to do then decided to take out the receiver from the usb receptacle and found that the metal square part on the receiver stuck into the usb receptacle so this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver became faulty with regular use over few weeks since bought it otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way not rugged enough maybe however though don know at this point if this is the way that all these rechargeable mouses are this brand or if this particular one that bought just did not actually pass quality control at the factory it seems the company should give me replacement am going to see about it but guess will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached will update if am able to 
positive,awesome mouse for the price
positive,crisp clear sound with great bass love being able to bluetooth connect all of the jbl speakers to have them playing in all the rooms in the house 
positive,bought this for my son and he loves it 
neutral,broke after nd use buyer beware 
neutral,i use it for my xbox
neutral,i bought jbl speakers which had high reviews did not know needed to install an app to get them in stereo installed the app confirmed by google play store and cant find it on my computer went to jbl video on youtube for help and they want me to watch two video ads first no thank you this is way too complicated update dont know how this product averages stars have two units that no longer use as went back to wired speakers aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh hear that that is the sound of me no longer being frustrated by wireless speakers the bluetooth lag is simply unacceptable once you figure how to pair the speakers in stereo then you have to press button on each speaker every time you want stereo there is only one active speaker in each unit the battery on one of the units never fully charges takes very long time to charge them if you lived close to me then would give them to you for free no longer want them 
neutral,truly mediocre mouse yes it lights up in different color but everything about this mouse is mediocre cheap feel the scroll does not work very well the click is not very good movement of actual mouse is not smooth don be taken in by the pictures trust the previous poor reviews 
positive,so far it seems to be working well hard to connect with the blue tooth have to fuss wish the base was better it ok but would like more 
positive,easy to use only took couple hours to first charge looks cute 
neutral,i use my mouse pretty so often and it lasted about weeks before had to charge it 
positive,my son enjoys this headset the quality is pretty good 
positive,i loved this mouse it was so pretty and the glided really smoothly everything worked great for about month and now the mouse won turn on ve charged it fully and whenever attempt to turn the switch on it shuts right back off that being said did buy another one being under don mind having to replace it hopefully it was fluke with the first mouse and this second one will work for much longer than few weeks if the same thing happens again will not be purchasing third 
neutral,the rose gold color is very pretty and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors there is an option to turn the colors off but you end up with red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around it will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to logitech or name brand get what you pay for in this case 
neutral,the bluetooth could of allowed voice calls to be made through the speaker
negative,nothing but issues the scroll wheel broke for no reason at all no longer holds charge would not recommend 
neutral,after months it does not work any more 
positive,it comes clean mine is dirty because eat while doing homework glows perfectly and comes with charger and plug in for your computer 
positive,i started with the jbl charge and was surprised how long it survived before had to retire it and upgrade to the jbl charge these speakers are built to last and have amazing sound quality as well as battery life will be an owner of this line of bluetooth speaker for life 
positive,for the price you can complain super low profile led lights works really well no lag 
neutral,maybe this one was bad one but the battery didn hold charge for to long and now is not even charging no more and is only month old
positive,the package came so quick it was very well packaged and it super glossy and actually looks like effort was put into making this headset highly recommend this headset for gaming other activities 
positive,so far so good
neutral,it just gets stains easily
positive,the mouse is exactly as it appeared love the lightness and design didn feel aggrevating symptoms of my carpel tunnel as quickly after use this enabled me to work longer 
neutral,i recommend it
positive,great seller
positive,i love the colors its super quiet keyboard great quality 
neutral,at first it was great however after few months it just stopped working disappointing 
negative,i purchased mouse and both became defective after month reached out to the seller and advised me the mouse has year warranty and will send me replacements up till this day no replacements were recieved and the seller stopped responding to me warning do not purchase 
positive,works and sounds great
neutral,long lasting battery one speaker isn bad instead of two like charge pink best choice just little heavy
neutral,comfort
positive,we ordered these for my son he likes to play roblox and minecraft we haven had any issues so far and he likes them 
neutral,enter key was difficult to reach going off size bit of stretch 
positive,received product on the th charged it and started using it the charge didn last that long maybe day at most but today it doesn work at all glad kept my old battery one 
neutral,good
positive,excellent product highly recommend 
positive,i only used this mouse for short while but it works very well was able to connect it using the usb transmitter very easily it does what it is supposed to do
neutral,only got to use it for month and then after that tried to charge it and but it didn charge and didn work not worth getting it doesn last long 
positive,bought this for kayaking after trying some other cheaper brands tried this and can say enough about sounds quality the bass hits hard for portable speaker and this gets loud like real loud love it and the battery life is second to none
positive, super cute for the office love the one lights 
negative,horrible
neutral,i was excited to get mouse that was usb charge instead of batteries ive charged it once and it worked great for about week which is awesome but have been trying to charge it now for days and it will not accept charge im past my return window and cannot get my money back or exchange it for new one this is big bummer 
positive,the sound quality is pretty good could not turn up volume past about halfway without getting distortion and bass was bottoming battery is great too much mid range little large and heavy no handles or convenient way to carry like the sound of my old bose mini sound link slightly better but will not get as loud of course 
positive,excellent for gaming incredible noise cancellation and great sound quality feels like actually in the game 
neutral,battery doesn last long and sleep mode is annoying so tossed it without warning it will just quit on you going back to battery brand 
neutral,it stopped working after months right in the middle of my shift at work 
neutral,i ordered my first one in april and had to replace it in june because dropped it and the mouse wheel stopped working got the new one june th and today once again the mouse wheel stopped working out of nowhere it barely even lasted three months
neutral,we have three my husband and each of my teenage boys my favorite part is we can synch all there and have surround sound in the backyard and around our pool 
positive,i just received this is the last week or so and it is exactly what expected turned it on it lights up keys are responsive and it even goes to sleep which really like customer service reached out with generic email hope you got it if not let us know leave review all that they also gave information about making the lights brighter and dimmer and the different settings very nice 
neutral,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an unethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the tracking sensor is also way too sensitive the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint chipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emits red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power 
positive,loud bass and vibrant audio quality
positive,buy buy buy it its so quiet so soft and so comfortable its easy to travel with and connectivity is great battery life is amazing 
negative,excellent feel but no warning when battery about to die which negates it for competitive gaming enter key also has horrible design and placement for work the dongle does not work if using kvm switch or if direct line of sight is not allowed if you can snag used one for less than new price it may be worth it but would not buy again 
positive,beautiful leds mouse works great 
positive,great headset at great price 
positive,jbl xtreme has better sound quality and would be tons better than two of these in stereo unless you re going for stereo image two of these wouldn be bad for the money though you ll have worse quality audio if money isn an issue two xtreme in stereo is the best option you cannot use flip with charge to use stereo speakers need to be the same to utilize stereo mode 
neutral,my mouse never worked charged it the first day for the recommended time when tried to use it it powered on briefly and then powered completely off thought it must not have charged completely so charged it again and again and again each time it did the same thing just threw it away never even got to use it 
positive,first off would like to say love this speaker it sounds amazing for the price and battery life is very good sit has year warranty to which had to use on my first one and have no complaints the battery quit charging so looked up the warranty and email them had no problems getting it replaced so my gripe is with the battery longevity life use mine everyday where work and getting about years out of this product but what do know not battery expert so for the price of this you can go wrong 
neutral,had troubles connecting when it did finally connect the cursor never appeared only the clickable buttons worked and would access random menus returned for full refund 
positive,rechargeable beautiful features long lasting hours for use on off switch 
positive,delivery was fantastic on time to collection point near my place arrived in days singapore also appreciate delivery updates via telegram ninjabot prompt the keyboard is brightly lit keys are responsive works like dream setup usb was without hitch as well packaging was good gee there were even nice stickers given and nice welcome note from the company looks like they take pride in their work awesome def good buy don see why any should spend more money on big brand names 
positive,i bought the keyboard for my boyfriend it awesome great to use in the dark although when the lights are pulsating the keyboard does make ringing sound other than that it was really easy for him to adjust from his old keyboard to this one and we ve charged it once for like minutes and it been working for days of use so the battery life is great definitely nice product
neutral,decided to upgrade to this one after having my headset for years worth it 
negative,i ve had this about month and it struggling to hold charge and the mouse is jumping there is also no option to return ll be going back to regular battery operated one as rechargeable is just not reliable dissapointed 
neutral,my son uses it for gaming and he likes it 
neutral,doesn stay charged long enough for me 
positive,i mainly use it for work zoom meetings it starts to hurt my ears after several hours or more hours but for the most part it comfortable highly recommend it 
positive,i had an older smaller jbl and the battery stopped holding charge upgraded it to this larger unit the sound is great and the larger battery lasts long time it will run out faster if you are also charging your phone while using it but that fair tradeoff the bluetooth connectivity is flawless 
positive,not my first jbl great products 
positive,headset is comfortable sound quality is good chat is little too quiet overall quality is better than expected for the money highly recommend these for casual gamers 
neutral,just wouldn connect plugged it in and was fully charged just didn work
positive,great customer service tho
positive,i use it for gaming on my ps and love this headset for the price 
positive,nice quality for good price 
negative,i had high hopes for this but unfortunently out of the box is disconnects constantly which makes it unusable for gaming it happens both unplugged and plugged in very disappointing poorly made product 
positive,fantastic sounding speaker with lots of volume 
positive,awesome little speaker perfect mix of being portable with good quality sound very happy with this little guy 
positive,top of the line speaker at great price would absolutely buy again 
positive,i got this and loved it at first it fit great to the hand and was very quiet but it wouldn keep charged it would only work for days then had to recharge it
neutral,very well made headset and crisp game volume 
positive,the mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly but you better not drop it or drop anything you re carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every minutes you use it there after should have expected this from such cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous 
neutral,loved it while it worked yet here we are two months later and it literally just stopped working ve tried multiple usb ports to no avail guess you get what you pay for
positive,i love this speaker it plenty loud and the charge lasts such long time great for parties or just around the house highly recommend this speaker 
positive,these headphones are very comfortable with nice clear sound 
negative,seems to hold charge for long time so far ve charged every couple of days work from home so my mouse gets lot of use got tired of replacing batteries in my other ones 
neutral,slightly annoying that it had to be recharged to even use it but the design is sleek good size and quiet 
positive,i had it for almost years and believe it was about bucks at the time have bad luck with headphones and cords this thing was godsend it may be cheap but what got was hours upon hours for gaming or just talking to friends 
positive,it comfy and noice canceling is good very happy with it 
positive,so far it stood up to my year old he bought these with his christmas money for his fortnite an every chance he gets he is playing any game or movie has them on since the pandemic an being in virtual school and not really having any friends this was perfect for him to be able to interact and play with some friends that we knew personally an other people should definitely be sectioned out in age groups definitely not this companys fault by any means he isn very easy on them either sure ve heard them dropand hit our very hard floors no less that times an still going strong
positive,perfect fo my sons video games comfy to wear 
positive,jbl charge is great product didn disappoint about it thanks
negative,i initially really enjoyed this mouse it is good size the battery life is reasonable and sucker for anything that lights up rainbow do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being constant red light however after using the mouse for less than months the scroll wheel stopped working and can figure out why ve tried cleaning it out recharging the battery and adjusting my driver settings with no luck definitely frustrated and because my return window has past not sure how to reach out to customer service 
negative,head set broke not good cord
neutral,good
neutral,keys bit small for handicapped dislike the illumination cutting off when in dark environment nice in all other respects
positive, these headsets are so freaking loud and they look amazing love them soooo freaking much highly recommend these 
positive,my son loves it
positive,i ve had this speaker for well over year now use it full volume in the shower while its soaking wet and also outside on the patio ve had it connected to my smaller tv that move between porch and patio but my sony works better for that due to the sony app to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the jbl app it still looks and works as good as when first got it battery lasts good amount of time and it has incredible bass for its size especially if its placed against wall or better yet in an inside corner have been very happy with its quality and performance now some negative aspects the battery level indicator lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out the base is small compared to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off table if bumped speakers are on the ends so you can stand it up vertical it does make loud melodic sound when turned off it is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of case adds no value is just another useless item cluttering your life and is environmentally negative suggest getting one without the case the current price is much much more percent more than when purchased it maybe due to covid price gouging or just rampant inflation never buy used product that requires built in battery as someone is unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still looks like new 
neutral,came defective
positive,very nice bought love it 
positive,the sound is amazing surprising amount of base love it 
neutral,good
neutral,this mouse stopped working one month in despite being charged and taken to my company tech desk to be looked at to see if was the problem 
positive,great sound and work well in the party mode with or more speakers battery life is good but if you like your music loud don expect more than hours of play time 
neutral,got it for my grandson for school his chrome book

neutral,you get what you pay for

neutral,bought for my th grader to use in school with her laptop on daily basis she used this for quite sometime now with no issues and she very rough on her things 
positive,great value mouse does it job and can complain with this price
neutral,sc
neutral,will be returning middle track roller does not work if the mouse sits idle for to long it loses wireless connection with the computer and you have to shut it off and turn it back on the led color changer is cool other than that it just ok 
neutral,my son really likes this headset and it worked well for the first months bought it for him for christmas and it no longer works properly by the end of feb unfortunately he can no longer talk with his friends while playing because the mouthpiece quit working he can still hear everything but they can hear him 
positive,this speaker has great sound quality and connects so quickly to my phone have used it lot and haven had to charge it yet 
neutral,i never use the mouse before it works for me
positive,love it 
positive,very good sound for its size loud enough and at top volume it still has clear sound 
positive,i was skeptical about buying this given its price but got discount during black friday and bought it the sound quality is amazing and connectivity is easy 
neutral,takes long time to charge
positive,it seemed fine at first but then tried to type the sign eventually figured out it was on another key not great if your only using it for gaming its good keyboard if you using chat it wouldn be great 
neutral,dont buy stopped working after weeks
positive,headset works as intended and the mic quality is great
positive,i shopped around for while great speaker sound excellent very happy
positive,i bought this because trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it not worth it the mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want like it pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this thankfully play with controller so it doesn hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don get this 
neutral,love the sensitivity settingthe battery lasts long time between charges
positive,great sound for smaller speaker 
neutral,recommend it 
neutral,only used few times and microphone not detectedthe headphones also use too much pressure on my ears compared to other headphones
neutral,its cool mouse till had to recharge it plugged in the cable that came with it and it started getting hot until saw smoke ripped it out almost burned my self regular phone charger works fine tho 
neutral,randomly turns off dies after short period of time
negative,only lasted hours when fully charged quite disappointed with this product overall 
neutral,i bought this mouse for work and gaming the first one that arrived broke within the first week of using it the scroll wheel broke returned it and got replacement now the scroll wheel on the replacement mouse has broken and the return window has closed if you re looking for wireless mouse do yourself favor and spend little extra for quality that won break after month or two 
positive,great sound and the mike is awesome use it for streaming and it doesn wonderful 
neutral,didn work 
positive,they are not the best at noise cancelling but everything else works great 
positive,so far so good great sound quality with some bass too 
positive,this has great mic and noise cancellation
positive,i like that the mouse is slim also like the lights and how smooth it is the sleep mode works fine use the mouse for work am happy with the rechargeable functionality and find don need to recharge daily so far have recharged every few days and don know how long the change will last but at least days for daily work use it is good value in my opinion 
positive,got these today and not sure if should even use them specially after learning most it reviews are fake bought new console along side these and not going to risk losing new controller if the adapter decides to break off inside it like some reviewers say the first red flag for me was definitely the packaging it was packed in large box with bubble wrap and just felt unofficial there was also wear on the ear pieces indicating prior use and the worst part is you don even have to use them in game to tell the mic is defective as it won even reach the front of you re face the cord as well as volume slider are bit obnoxious in size and the product overall feels like fragile plastic off brand did test them on my switch and the sound was surprisingly good noticed background static at first which lot of people mentioned but it wasn terrible or even noticeable at times ll probably stash these away for backup pair and just buy name brand pair for the same or even better price and if you are also looking for solid gaming headset then please help yourself and look away from these 
positive,there isn whole lot not to like about this product the sound quality is impressive to say the least have yet to find circumstance where it is necessary to even hit half volume haha the bass is damn near as nice as the speakers in my car which guess isn saying much just have an set up the battery life is another very impressive part of this buy play my speaker probably good hrs day and generally don have to charge it until the third day of doing this have yet to play with eq functions on the app as out of the box the audio balance was pretty on point all in all can say am extremely pleased with the product 
positive,great range finally we found wireless mouse that works well we use this for television viewing we have our laptop attached to our television we are good feet away from our television and laptop when we use this mouse again it has great range easy to use and works quickly highly recommended 
negative,i have only had this speaker approximately one month but it will not hold charge so am somewhat disappointed
positive,speaker gets super loud for the size really enjoyed
positive,absolutely love this mouse if it were to break would buy this product again 
neutral,i do not recommend this mouse worked all of days changed the batteries and it still does not work spend your money on basic mouse that works 
neutral,charge doesn last long at all feels cheap works for my year old to use but nothing would keep for myself 
positive,needed temporary set of headphones and they do not work with my ps controller don care about the lights which need to be connected via usb but the audio does not work with my ps works perfectly fine on my laptop but not on my ps which is extremely annoying 
positive,really disappointed wanted to love this product but the usb adapter that came with it doesn fit into my usb port it looks like it only goes half way in so basically the product is useless the mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate wish the adapter worked
positive,i purchased this keyboard last year in november and have been very satisfied with it performance it is comfortable to type on and the different color backlighting is cool but it would be better if the sleep mode didn take effect so soon this is an issue when in dim room because it can be bit difficult to see the opaque lettering before pressing on that first key to activate the lights additionally recently the keyboard was only staying on if it was connected to the charging cable it came with and last week it began shutting off intermittently even while connected that should have alerted me to the fact that it was cable issue and not battery issue but it didn and contacted klim customer service lolita the customer service agent responded quickly and one of the suggestions given was to try different cable but she also reiterated that there was year warranty should none of the suggestions resolve the issue charging with different cable that already had in my possession worked and am now utilizing the keyboard again without having to be connected am extremely happy with this product and their customer service and would not hesitate to order one of their other products should need one in the future 
positive,it works great with lighting up clicking speed the scroll doesn work to move the screen up and down 
positive,they re great 
neutral,the keyboard when it lights up makes strange high pitched buzz hearing that none stop would definitely cause headache in addition the keys are very loud especially the spacebar it does look pretty cool when lit but there is no way could have handled the buzz none stop 
positive,best mouse ve ever bought so glad got it perfect for my job 
positive,the bass of the speaker is great and the battery life is far greater than expected 
neutral,it is hard to use and the sensation is not good 
positive,this is good product good price
neutral,bruh this headset worked for few months then the light started to not work and then my input was all messed up can get corsair headset for just dollars more and it would be better
positive,awesome sound excellent battery life 
positive,my son loved it 
neutral,update seller has sent multiple emails asking me to remove this review in exchange for money claiming this is an email from amazon costumer service this is the nd purchase for me the first one wasn labeled upgrade it lasted about months until dropped it on the floor this one the upgrade doesn work well at all the left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages the connectivity was also delayed despite trying different computers and different settings the problems persisted returned the upgrade 
neutral,i loved this product but when went to remove it from the usb slot the inner part broke off inside the computer 
neutral,my son goes through headphones quickly not certain what he does to them these are holding up well to the abuses of kid they have good noise cancelling because he can hear me when try to talk to him the short fixed boom is wired well and seems to be holding up 
positive,works great
neutral,i really like this mouse 
positive,sound and mic quality are top notch very pleased with the product
positive,awesome keyboard the lights are amazing and the keys feel great when typing 
positive,amazing keyboard use it everyday and holds great charge
positive,work great for what got it for
neutral,the features on this mouse are really good it worked well initially but after only days it wouldn work anymore and ended up in the garbage do not recommend buying this one 
neutral,the colors were great while it worked the wheel broke and the usb fell apart when pulling it out of the computer 
neutral,ease of use and portability
negative,it did not perform well for gaming the wireless connection was bad and it overall sucked
positive,a friend of mine had one of these had to get one for myself puts out good sound and isn ridiculously expensive 
negative,the mouse never worked am very disappointed 
positive,i use it for my xbox one and it works great my only complaint is that the cord is really long but don care 
neutral,i use this product for customer service 
positive,my son loves the headset we ve ordered several before but this headset has the right hookup for xbox one great sound quality too 
positive,i just recently bought two of them to be able to sync both speakers up together and it just makes the atmosphere of where you are just that much better we just recently went out to the river and it was great to have them both connected since we could have one in the water and one with everyone else who was sitting down the range on these are pretty decent as well and the battery can easily last all day but only if its not to max volume great speakers though and highly recommend 
neutral,it is so slow and lags find better option
negative,the cord is entirely too irritating and in the way 
neutral,the scroll wheel stopped working right after the return window closed so can even return it 
neutral,did the job
positive,battery life is great sound is clear and loud 
neutral,you get what you pay for this thing is piece of crap 
negative,within week of my son using it the scroll button broke somehow it outside the return window so now we are stuck with it 
positive,perfect size perfect sound for its size take mine everywhere and have been using the jbl portable speakers for many years now never been disappointed will continue to buy them and recommend them 
positive,my son loves his gaming mouse
positive,i thoroughly enjoy using these when playing online with my friends and also use them to listen to music they are amazing when it comes to playing call of duty of nba the quality is amazing for the price 
positive,the mouse was very easy to setup had instructions on charging on the mouse itself would definitely recommend great on the price as well 
neutral,wheek scroll was brock
positive,cannot use the product due to false marketing had to research this product extra and finally found that the last picture shows chart again on the last page saying an adapter is needed the original page on amazon shows xbox one is supported as it comes that is false marketing 
neutral,this thing rocks 
positive,the mouse is great the install was very easy just plug it in and it is ready to use love the changing lights on the mouse if anyone wants led wireless mouse this is the mouse to purchase 
positive,great mouse when it works sleek design good performance six week after got it it stopped working it is just few days past the product return deadline have written to the manufacturer lets wait what happens 
neutral,if have ps or do not buy it it would only be good for pc you can always hear the other person and the cord is way to long
positive,speaker bangs fantastic battery life
positive,love it
positive,great sound new it was good plan to buy thanks so much
neutral,the good decent sound quality and relatively comfortable the bad uses an analogue jack for the speakers making plugging it into certain devices difficult or impossible without an add on like splitter the microphone is an inflexible piece of plastic and people talk to online complain about my voice being muffled and distorted overall overpriced for what amounts to an okay pair of headphones 
positive,my son recently was gifted this headset for birthday he loves it an it fits his head perfectly he says he can hear is friends good an they can also hear him well highly recommend this headset 
neutral,the mouse stopped working after about month of use 
positive,love this mouse so easy to use simple set up 
negative,not great battery life and not for loud listening 
positive,i use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing but does what it supposed to do great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand
neutral,i have never used it because everything is in chinese even the machine it self 
positive,i wanted to find slim wireless mouse similar to mac magic mouse without the high price tag while this certainly isn magic mouse it pretty good substitute for fraction of the cost there are some tradeoffs of course due to the slim nature of this mouse it is extremely lightweight not built like tank and sometimes the buttons require sturdy click to ensure response but all in all happy with my purchase it looks nice works well and it has gone about months so far without needing recharge speaking of which leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode no big deal just realize you need to click button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop otherwise it will seem like the mouse isn working also ve had couple of instances where had to reinsert the usb adapter to get it to reconnect but that was maybe times in the past couple of months in short recommend this product the company provided great support when received the wrong color mouse and they ve been top notch to deal with they stand behind their product 
positive,the mouse is well built and works as intended the led lighting is pretty cool step above the daily dull plain mice out there 
neutral,it is all as discribed loaded with features
negative,really bad and not worth it
negative,loses connection lot sitting no more than from computer screen 
positive,this mouse is sleek and cool looking it fun to use and everyone is envious of it because it lights up best mouse have ever got want another for my desktop use this one on my laptop best buy for the money and so cool too 
positive,works perfectly for work computer
neutral,half the time there is about delay after moving mouse and moving the curser 
neutral,have purchased of them and both are not working after about weeks changed batteries and still no luck you get what you pay for
negative,just by the logitech and skip the savings from this cheap import bought this to replace wired mouse on my kvm switch and it worked great for two months would plug in to charge using an open usb port on my switch was super convenient turning it off every night while it charged the next day unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly and was able to use for the whole day hrs no problem then about two weeks ago same usual routine go to use the next day and completely dead revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch hrs later swap back out lights come on for about seconds and again completely dead now out of the return policy not even months later and screwed 
positive,provides the best sound quality and noise cancellation for their price highly highly recommend
neutral,i don see where they get hour battery life thing didn even give me hours good sound quality though
neutral,was good while it worked used for basic office work nothing heavy scroll button broke despite almost never using that function 
positive,it very small really enjoyed the sleek design of it but think ll have to give this to my kid yeah the padding is soft but very firm maybe my ears are too big cause it hurts to wear after long period of time max hours the microphone isn great for what wanted just too soft spoken of person for this to work for me probably cause the mic is stiff and can get it any closer to my face this purchase was learning experience for me 
positive,great speaker provides good sound and lasts long time the reason for the star deduction is because the battery didn last as long as advertised took it on float trip and it died about hours in granted had it turned up max the entire time and it was hot day but think it should have lasted longer also the sound on the float wasn as loud as would have liked it was incredibly sturdy and portable no complaints there 
neutral, sleek design and very responsive and most all it sleeps when you re not using it 
positive,sounds great purchased the flip couple years ago and wanted more sound quality this thing is awesome 
negative,my only real complaint is that every time you actually turn the switch off when you switch it back on it goes back to full lights that personal preference know but only turn the lights on occasionally you should also know that the positioning of the colors is not changeable they are on pulsing on off or off no ability to change any of the lights which is fine by me but might bother other people 
positive,i bought one of the used headphones said it was in great condition just the packaging was different when tried to talk with my friends couldn hear them and the mic was not working no matter what did terrible quality and an overall nuisance to use 
positive,my kiddo needed wireless mouse to take with him to school and this was so fun for him it light weight pretty durable and love that he can charge it along with his laptop at night 
neutral,nice gaming keyboard for the price 
negative,the headset is nice but the cord on the actual product is different from the instructions there are two jacks one for the game controller and usb connection to power the lights if you look at the pictures the split is further down closer to the jacks than what is explained in the instructions doubt anyone would be able to use the lights unless they re sitting next to an outlet also there isn much room to use the controller if the usb is connected to power source poor design of the cord

positive,tiny great for laptop size 
positive,okay here we go was really excited to get this and try it out want to note that wasn expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive however my excitement didn last long the dpi will not change on the one got so changed my mouse settings on my pc this very very minimally helped couldn help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic ccccck for some this may fit comfortably in their hand but not mine also it goes to sleep quickly as in seconds quick yes timed it unfortunately ll have to try to return this since won use it ever by try to return it mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office or wherever need to take it because that never actually happens in closing if you have small hands you re looking for super slick meaning super fast mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi you ll only use it once maybe twice year and you re good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned then go for it otherwise maybe look into different one also gave stars since is was inexpensive 
positive,this came with an adaptor to fit the apple laptop but is not made specifically for apple products the charge does not last long and needs special adaptor prefer battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome the three settings for on off are also less than ideal in summary while this mouse is aesthetically pretty it is not functional with the apple products

negative,item must ve been defective or something because in was it stopped working charging and pretty much would my work at will also the returns process with this vendor sucks it not via amazon had to go twice to ups because had to print the label or pay to print on site then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in if would ve paid little bit more for higher quality would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle save yourself the grief and get one little bit more upscale 
positive,we have used all name brand portable speakers this one is by far the best so far super clear and waterproof 
positive,better than my mercedes benz speaker easy to carry to open house 
neutral,bought this to replace my destroyed jbl flip sound quality is awful compared to the flip also the flip had lanyard attachment to hang it which you can with the charge and the charge function takes hours to charge my samsung overall save your money and get the flip its less expensive louder better quality

neutral,i ve really liked these headphones but ve only had them for couple months and the sound is already going out on them does anyone know what the company warrantee on this product is 
neutral,it charged up the first time and didn charge up again after that and the replacement batteries for it cost more than the mouse itself very cool looking tho 
positive,i don know about the quality because don use it but it was used by an year old and his year old brother for many months and has not broken yet so know it sturdy 
neutral,the product looks high quality exactly like the picture its light weight noise cancellation imdepends on the volume and cab be adjusted instructions are simple and to the point

positive,after hours of youtube reviews and black friday cyber sale decided to go with this large awkward speaker with only decent battery life and ok sound quality know now for fact that the bose is way better the charge distorts at about of max volume and doesnt have the bass like that of smaller devices just because you add some flexy vibrating cones on the ends doesnt mean there will be better bass

neutral,for some reason when charger it it does not last long sometimes even have to use it while charging might have to return it
positive,finally decided to buy portable speaker and not disappointed with my decision first time playing impressed me update after using the speaker for some time it not the best would recommend depends on the purpose the bt range is pretty incredible it gets the job done for being portable like others stated it mono with the two woofers battery seems to drain on me little quicker so make sure keep it charged after or during use 
positive,excellent quality product very good sound for the size battery lasts for long time super happy with this product 
positive,my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider 
negative,i ve had this speaker for about months and everything is great with it but really irritated because one of the sub speakers have blown this was pretty expensive speaker and now that that blew it sounds really bad
positive, loveddddddd my mouse super excited but used to clicking the scrolling piece to create the auto scroll well did it and now my scrolling piece is broken sooooo don push the scrolling piece but overall love it and it instantly connected to my macbook pro and everything was working great 
neutral,just not enough bass on the flip side bought the next step up the jbl boom box and it had to much bass chose too much bass over to little bass 
neutral,the keyboard lights on but is slow and the key almost break didn like quality 
neutral,mouse works great when you first plug it in but if you wait few minutes it will lag so much your better off using the laptop mouse disappointed in these high reviews because mine does not work 
positive,i work at place that supplies cheap basic keyboards and splurged to make my workday better with something that makes me happy how did they let you order that mine is crap etc bought it with my own money to make me smile with the rainbow at my finger tips muhaha love it 
neutral,the keyboard works good for normal use for gaming it is terrible you cannot press more than few keys at the same time if you do some don respond just broke it in half and threw it in the trash 
positive,great audio and good microphone quality works better with noise cancellation 
neutral,just got it seems fine
neutral,the volume output of this speaker is disappointing even at max volume it seems quiet 
positive,the wife needed new mouse found this one she said she liked it ordered it she loves it very sleek works perfectly usb charging instead of batteries awesome 
neutral,there typo on the mouse mouse works good though there is minor glitch where it tends to not want to move on screen for couple seconds after touching it after couple minutes of inactivity 
positive,i used this for my security system and works very good easy to set up
neutral,im giving this because got one in black for my sister and she hasnt had any issues bought one in blue and the left click sticks not sure if it was dropped at some point prior to me receiving it or if there is inconsistent quality with the product at the price its not worth the hassle of returning it to get replacement 
positive,love it the rose gold color is so cute and it lightweight loves the light change works great for me 
neutral,i got this almost month ago and only had to charge it once since then 
neutral,i love this mouse the only reason gave it star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite when scroll forward away from me the page goes down and when scroll backwards towards me the page goes up getting used to it but rather it just be like normal mouse is there any way to fix this or does anyone else have this problem 
neutral,i bought this mouse because it was rechargeable it worked fine for few days and then just quit working ended up having to return it 
neutral,this mouse stopped working not even weeks after started using it not worth it 
positive,for the price is great my son love it 
neutral,they work goodalso for teaching online
neutral,this mouse feels very sleek to the hand however the battery only lasts about hours and takes about an hour to charge fully the led lights are not very bright even when turn the feature off the mouse still dies in about three hours 
neutral,my mic has stopped working had it for ish months other then my mic not working it has very good sound for gaming 
neutral,i bought this mouse to go with my work laptop when have to travel to sites hate using the pad that is built into the laptop this is cute and little am thinking about using it for my personal laptop when gaming or doing school work 
positive,it doesn have tail so it more of hamster but it is very nice hamster it lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor can speak on it for gaming as only use it for working from home but did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well obviously did indeed by it again 
positive,this would be star but in order to use light on headphones you have to plug it in that wouldn be bad but the cord to plug it into ur xbox is super short you would have to latterly but on top of the system to use it other than that they are fine don buy this for the light because they probably won be close enough to the tv to use it 
negative,it stopped working after jus days it sucks period 
positive,i love how this soundsother persons voice is so clearfor the price it really goodi use this for my nintendo switch
neutral,it is somehow ok
negative,don buy died as soon as the return period is over can get refund for it
positive,sounds so good and gets very loud bluetooth connects to both my iphone and my boyfriends android easily every time the battery life is amazing as well worth the money 
negative,when bought this wireless keyboard was expecting to be able to use my keyboard from my couch which is probably about away from my computer max can get more than about feet away before this terrible dongle starts to lose connection am using the same usb extender had my xbox one controller dongle on so it was as far from the rest of my equipment as could make it with direct line of site to my klim keyboard and still dropped the connection completely after about feet this is definitely only an okay keyboard if you are sitting at desk right next to your computer but needless to say very disappointed 
positive,my son loves it
neutral,good quality for gaming
positive,great wireless louse easy to connect and the charges lasts all day
negative,the scroll button broke after just month would not recommend
negative,my speaker won turn on it dead and useless such disappointment 
neutral,it doesn work
neutral,this mouse is terrible bought it for work its not like needed anything super advanced just something that would give me little more space than the touchpad this mouse skips when you move it and if you want to click something you have to hit the button or times it also very uncomfortable in the hand 
positive,love this mouse work excellent 
neutral,this item only worked for less than days it was going well and then stopped holding charge
neutral,product was great the only thing jbl could of did was add the power brick and not just the usb cable also ppl to turn on the lower bass setting hold and bluetooth button for secs until the circle around the buttons light up wy 
positive,love the design after two weeks it has started to fail again this is my nd one hoping it just fluke 
neutral,very nice

neutral,good for its intended purpose very light and flimsy but it works so far 
negative,i bought this speaker months ago because had the jbl charge before that worked forever and enjoyed it but this one suddenly stopped charging and now doesn work in less than months very very disappointed
neutral,sensitive mouse maybe because it new works fine
positive,nice sound bought it for my husband for christmas and he loves it 
positive,i bought this mouse because saw it was wireless silent click which was perfect for me working in class room and not loving to hear the click of mouse all day have dropped it times and each time have been able to just move the plastic back into place and repair so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when move between classes to see my different classes 
positive,bought this to replace my old jbl bluetooth speaker that finally bit the dust after years of being pool speaker in the texas heat this one was major upgrade the sound is great and it connects easily every time ve used it the battery seems to last forever too which is great 
positive,i purchased this mouse for my new macbook pro it is so much better than the apple magic mouse was using with my imac this mouse fits perfectly in my hand and is easy to maneuver the adapter for the usb port on my mac works and fits perfectly am extremely happy with my purchase the mouse also is rechargeable which will save me money as will not be purchasing aaa batteries anymore highly recommend this product the quality and appearance of this mouse make it seem like much more expensive product stars 
negative,it decent but the power button was finicky and doesn turn on have to mess with it little feels kinda cheap but it will do for now
positive,i love this mouse cool color scheme and comfy to use
positive,great speaker exactly as described new sealed from factory super fast shipping 
negative,product is cheaply made and also microphone isn compatible to xbox very disappointed 
neutral,item didn come with dongle then when the dongle was sent still didn work in any computer highly advise on not buying
positive,this was great mouse for schoolwork and better then using battery mouse
neutral,this item sounds great and looks great but it doesn stay charged so that makes it useless or decorative paperweight 
negative,very frustrating as they both broke on the same day about month after purchase and too late to return 
neutral,the volume just isn loud enough have it turned all the way up and it somewhere between whisper and an inside voice not impressed at all 
positive,stopped working after the second week charged it overnight every night before left the office and it was working fine then it started skipping so tried to put it on the charger for the day and used another mouse thinking maybe it just didn charge the night before then when took it off it wouldn work at all but it does feel great in your hands and the lighting is pretty cool just wish it would have lasted 
positive,needed backup gaming headset the microphone audio is little low and the earmuffs are little on the small side but overall it is decent and working headset the head cushion on top is really comfortable 
neutral,bought of these the lights are fun and fit really well in smaller hands but these christmas gifts are no longer usable durability stinks my opinion would not buy 
neutral,i loved the design and cool light features but true to the old saying you get what you pay for this mouse was pretty bad it jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button or times before it responds to your request very frustrating to say the least not good buy 
positive,i have small head but that isn anyone fault it just doesn fit well even on the smallest setting the ear pieces rest too low which probably wouldn be big issue but have glasses as well and it presses to hard on my glasses just think they could have designed it with more flex in the size expansion thingies is all otherwise its good 
neutral,bluetooth connection is magical very good sound
positive,purchased these headphones and after month the sound started going in and out because the wire shorted they worked fine before that but you get what you pay forupdate bengoo reached out and made things right by sending me new headset so far this one is working fine and appreciate their integrityupdate the new headset that was sent to me shorted again the audio keeps going in and out was hoping this was just fluke but this products wire is just not good
positive,i really like very helpful
neutral,only lasted month didn even care for refund just threw it away 
positive,quality for gaming and great noise cancellation
positive,the audio quality from the headphones is pretty great but the mic could be better 
negative,it worked less than month before it stopped charging and became useless purchased second one and will see how long it lasts 
positive,it very nice and helpful for gamin
neutral,several years ago purchased pair of jbl charge speakers to use around our pool and was immediately in love would connect one to my phone and then link the pair and have nice even sound all across our pool the range was great the sound was great and the batteries lasted long time we eventually wore the batteries out and decided to replace them with pair of jbls latest charge speakers the charge the sound quality and other features are the same but the instability and sensitivity of the bluetooth connection and link feature are so bad they are unusable have to have my phone within feed of the speaker for the bluetooth to connect and they constantly cut out loose their connection to each other or pick up static it is so persistent we are not using them anymore deeply regret buying these speakers and wish would have spent less money to but the far superior charge speakers again if you plan to connect two or more speakers together stay away from these because they just don work 
neutral,this product worked fine for few months but now they arent working you can hear other good but guess the mic is crap because the other people can her you talking even with the mic turned all the way up gave them to child for christmas and with in months they aren working and he complained the whole time that the other kids can hear him will not make this purchase again 
positive, really was waiting for use this mouse and everything ok great pink golden color amazing that is rechargeable and super ergonomic for edit my videos 
positive,great bluetooth speaker ve had others that can even even come close to this one 
negative,the mouse worked great until one day it stopped scrolling ve had it just about month the rest of the mouse seems to be working but the scroll wheel is no longer responsive 
neutral,it was going well for few weeks then my son dropped his macbook and the usb type connected broke its so easy to break and would not recommend
positive,great sound
neutral,thank you
positive,great item 
positive,great headphones
positive,lasts long on initial charge perfect size 
neutral,if your buy it to play in the dark like did it is worthless put it back in the box use steering wheel and button box so don use key keyboard all the time but when need to have to turn light on to see what key to hit send it back if could and get one that stays lit until turn it off useless to me for playing in the dark 
neutral,sound quality bluetooth connectivity use lot at the beach 
positive,love the sound 
positive,this is great buy and they have amazing customer service so had to buy this wireless keyboard especially for my second monitor lastly it lasts very long like days long my only wish is for hair trigger like keys for rhythm games or fps but other wise great buy 
positive,we had an issue with the first set and the company replaced them the set is awesome would order from this company again thank you for backing your product 
neutral,i enjoy everything about it 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse it super easy to use and really fun with the different colors out of 
positive,product looks nice the cord is long and they are lightweight the led lights are nice this is nice entry level headset for gaming 
negative,i bought this mouse on the th of august and it broke on the st of the same month basically it lasted me for less than month the lights stopped working properly and then the middle part to scroll stopped working it broke do not recommend at all
neutral,very nice
positive,i ha giving reveiws bu errible producfor gaming mulible kes ha nvr worked ried ignor bu from msg can see alo of kes don work his looks lijke gibbersih because doesn work
negative,mouse completely died and wouldn charge in less than month no return policy
positive,very cheaply made it was the biggest waste of my money the piece that plugs into the usb port broke in weeks time as was taking it out of the port it can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it dont know that its worth it guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed it was pretty cool how it lights up it is very lightweight as well which will leave that to your own interpretation 
positive,great sound and noise canceling 
neutral,i bought this for my son and it dies very fast and it does change colors by itself like it shows on here
neutral,this is everything was looking for but after having it if there was one thing can add it would be button to forward skip to the next song but that just first world problem like said it was everything was looking for 
positive,in short you get what you pay fori am currently traveling and needed cheap mouse could use this one definitely does the trick and looks nice with the colors on the side but also has couple downsides the dpi change button doesn work on mac the colors at the border aren really bright and even the red light of the sensor always shines through it also is bit small if you have big hands which is upset if you re traveling since it will fit in small spaces in general it is good mouse if you do not want to spend lot of money but there are things that could be better if you want to spend bit more 
positive,it has excellent sound quality and very pleased 
positive,item worked fine for months and then no longer would turn on and yes it was fully charged of course it was past the return date so its basically junk save your money and buy name brand
positive,no batteries needed this works great and it lites up too easy to charge and use no problems at all 
negative,hello these headphones didn last more than months there is no audio am disappointed in the quality and would have thought these would have lasted longer 
negative,i have to change my review from star to star had surgery couple weeks ago so my keyboard sat unused for weeks and getting back to it it only works about half the time it either won type anything at all or it types the wrong thing nothing was spilled on it it is dust free undamaged etc now realize the lighting up underneath is hampering problem instead of good thing because if all it did was light up under the keys that would be fine but without the keys having painted on white letters they re virtually impossible to see and that pain in the ass wanted to return the keyboard for refund so could get different one but apparently passed that window while was recovering from surgery also have asked questions of the seller but they have yet to be answered so my original star review has now dropped to star and if this continues over the next week ll leave worse review and drop it to star for customer service alone paid for product and expect it to work and if it not going to work expect to be able to get my money back so can find product that does work am an author and gamer and this has really messed up both aspects 
positive,amazing product 
positive,i had it for two months from the first day it kept turning on and off and it became more frequent as time goes by also it connects with my devices randomly while all the devices bluetooth connection are disconnected now it turns on and off every sec drove me crazy had to leave it in the basement until return read that some costumers had the same problem on jbl web site it seems like common problems for this product tried to reset but it did not work asked for the technical help to jbl support but they asked all the photo of proof of purchase serial number shipping address why what if got as gift did not like how they treats decided to return while can mos did not like the sound either compare with my beats speaker the sound if more like boom box not delicate 
positive,so light and love it being rechargeable
neutral,upon opening this speaker noticed it comes in very nice box the speaker seems durable and sounds amazing when it works right only had this for days used it the st day worked great come the rd day not so much it will play but cut out intermittently during songs speaker stays on it just literally stops when it wants to and plays when it wants to figure got lemon so ll try another might suggest don bother talking with support they will drive you insane just replace and move on 
positive,this is an amazing mouse would definitely buy again 
negative,terrible just received it charged it didn leave it plugged in after charging when tried it the next day it gliched on and turn off does not turn on now ve read some other reviews and this is apparently happening alot with jbl products coming from amazon 
positive,great speaker use it everyday when working out haven plugged it in to charge for over week great battery life sounds is awesome worth the money
positive, just live my cordless keyboard and mouse they match my hp desktop computer perfectly 
positive,so bought this few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday the color changing lights worked and now only the red light works this is bs turned it off for mins to give it rest but nope the lights still don work don recommend
neutral,i rently sing the keyboard to type this reew if you notice any missing letters thts ply the adyig meai type this out dont know this is inditra atter sily ulty pd in all seriousness that speaks for itself just plugged the keyboard to charger to finish typing this review there may be some issue with the battery level indicator there no actual warning before that starts happening type at maybe wpm and the sentence above was gibberish dropped input after dropped input this keyboard is ok for casual webpage scrolling but don rely on it to do anything important after the first hour of use 
neutral,stopped working after two months
positive,is there valid customer support the website link goes to something completely different my usb plug fell apart and want to inquire about new one ve had this keyboard for about months and now cannot use it update klim responded immediately and is sending out new usb plug am impressed with the fast response and their willingness to help 
positive,this is good product especially for the reasonable price it is just as described so am very happy with it 
neutral,the mouse is very good and love the colors but it seems to go into sleep mode way too often unfortunately my mouse stopped working after few weeks after purchase 
positive,happy with the sound quality
negative,so there is no way to turn off the sleep mode the point of lit keyboard was to see the keys after sixty seconds the light turns off and have to hit random key to get the light on that makes the entire purchase waste asked for lit keyboard because needed keyboard that would be lit this is not lit for more than minute at time it an unlit lit keyboard 
neutral,this mouse doesn work ordered replacement and it still didn work don waste your money 
positive,i not rating this one star because it is cute mouse and like the design for some reason found my macbook trackpad more comfortable to use than this mouse my wrists were hurt within couple hours of using this mouse that being said used it in moderation wanted to like it however received this mouse january th as of january responsiveness has gone downhill after taking it off the charger it has short battery life it takes about seconds and moving the scroll wheel for it to respond again even then it might have some hard to ignore hiccups 
neutral,real good and the charge last lot 
positive,this device does play in stereo ve seen several reviews say that it doesn but can verify you will hear the various channels in the music you won regret getting this just be very gentle with the cable that charges it and the plug ins don power jam the buttons it doesn require an ape like approach to use this speaker when you press the power button there delay lightly press and listen feel for the button to click then just wait few seconds it will come to life battery life is awesome use it every day at the office for hours and charge it maybe twice week good product yes it stereo anyone who says otherwise doesn have the ears and intelligence to know what stereo really is 
positive,this works great and is very quiet also like the lighting options 
neutral,the mouse quality is poor type adapter doesn work can work for macbook but usb adapter works 
positive,i love this mouse the colors are beautiful and ve gotten many compliments on it it feels great to use as well took away one star because the charging cord stopping working about day after using it easily charges with any micro usb though it been couple months and still works being used every day at work 
positive,bought this to use at work and absolutely love it not only are the changing colorful lights pretty cool it works really well however the best part about this mouse is that it is rechargeable bye bye batteries 
negative,the product was quite obviously not new the product box not the shipping box was damaged and had return labels peeled off the keyboard had corner broken off and there was dust all over it the dongle for wireless use was not included nor were any cords horrible experience 
positive,this speaker is awesome was bit skeptical about the passive radiators but was impressed it doesn pump bass as much as wired speaker such as echo plus but the sound is still excellent and the battery life is great usually play music off and on during my workweek and charge it once per week gave it stars due to the poor usb implementation the speaker charges through its usb port however it is only able to output power to act like powerbank and charge phone for example through its usb port my recommendation to jbl is to ditch the usb port entirely and use the usb port for charging and power output 
positive,i love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn run by batteries this seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double but then you have to think about remembering to charge it if you ve been using it all day non stop it starts to die by the night time other than that think it super cute and it pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces didn have much of an issue 
neutral,just what my son wanted 
positive,my son loves the headset
positive,honestly it is really good 
negative,i was using it for my laptop that use for work and school and the mouse stop working in week horrible 
neutral,i like the design and feel of the mouse my concern is that it tends to go to sleep and anytime have not used it for few minutes have to press the button on top and then it does come right back on guess with time will learn to do that each time want to use it in use it does not function as smoothly as had hoped it would hesitating to start and then the curser hops when am trying to drag it from one place to another 
positive,works great for playing video games 
positive,great bass and battery life but crackles at low volume but sounds great at and up
positive,very good headset for cheap price very glad bought this if you re hesitant bc of the price buy it 
positive,convenient quite excellent connection with computer
neutral,my son uses the mouse for gaming on his macbook air 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse great color matches my laptop perfectly love the color changing mode so fun 
positive,great for gaming and work from home very silent and waterproof accidentally tested but the rgb could improve more modes or disable the sleep mode could be great
neutral,doesn track with with or without the cable do not purchase 
positive,it good for pinch it doesn have the best quality also it not for console gaming the led lights needs to be hooked up to usb in order to light up wouldn recommend if you want to play on console ended up going back to turtle beach 
neutral,this mouse was great at first but after week the scrolling part stopped working 
positive,the headset works perfectly they arrived on time and had no trouble connecting them or using it personally use it foe gaming and its nice sound quality when talking through it really like them 
positive,we absolutely love these speakers the sound quality is great and the battery lasts for days we use it for house parties at the beach and when we travel highly recommend them and have bought them as gifts for my kids as well 
negative,started off great but the charge stopped working couldn tell if it needing charging one day it didn turn on left it to charge while it was off and on hours each way and it still wouldn hold charge or turn on battery ended up exploding and started leaking acid overall horrible product
neutral,real light weight easy to use connects quickly
neutral,do not drop the mouse on the floor very sensitive and broke right away after having it for year so this is the second one ordered works very well and has cute colors 
positive,i wanted silent mouse due to classes using proctorio with professor who was huge on thinking sounds could be cheating absolutely loved how silent it is when you press the buttons only thing haven got to work as well is the wireless aspect but it doesn bother me just plug it in for charging wise and use it as wired mouse love the changing lights as well works well for my laptop loved having light up gaming mouse for my desktop and now have something similar to use for my laptop that quiet 
negative,it broke at the first fall and it was not big fall the inner clips on broke and the other twisted so am unable to close it and simpler does it work 
neutral,so got this to replace my drab old keyboard and glad did the fact that it rechargeable was big sell for me and the very light texture feel nice to touch the only problem though not game changer for me having is that the main enter button feels further away or maybe it smaller than what used to but overall it thumbs up 
positive,nice mouse worked great for my needs glides smooth holds charge well 
positive,perfect for gaming lightweight and good quality 
neutral,good material
neutral,i got this mouse for work it works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can be used with battery it only usb charger so the only down side of this if work with it for days will need to charge it or it will die on and have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it it unfortunately not for me and don like how it doesn have battery or dies fast 
positive,love it 
neutral,bought this for my granddaughter for christmas in nov she has been using it for less than days and it has critical issues with defective on off function contacted the jbl help line and tried all the reset options they offered but they did not work will try to get warrantee replacement from jbl 
positive,purchased for an external keyboard for laptop colors are vibrant 
positive,works great in the dark brightness and colors are fantastic and the battery life seems to last for days also the kick back from the keys makes typing breeze ll be looking for more products from klim 
positive,my son has only been using the headset for few days but he likes it and it appears to be more durable than the xbox brand we ve been through several of those in short period of time 
neutral,i will avoid jbl from now on sound was great until it broke now dead refund was no problem thats why shop amazon 
neutral,works on macbook pro 
positive,just make sure the usb is plugged in otherwise this headset sounds great and the mic works fantastic 
positive,i bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it definitely would be buying one for myself soon 
positive,i love it easy to install and use mouse is soft and movies easily 
negative,bought these for gaming worst thing ever bought can barely hear anything even with the volume turned all the way up don waste your money or time with this junk 
neutral,for gaming
positive,excellent item excellent customer service
positive,there really nothing to dislike about it love the fact that don have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it not going to work the way it charges is one of the main reasons that bought it rather save the for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if have enough spare batteries have mouse pad that has breathing mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts for the amount spent give this mouse also love the fact that it easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying again if my mouse will run out of power think that there should be more accessories that can charge from usb port rather than lugging around extra batteries 
neutral,the product works well 
neutral,this mouse is very quiet like it says in the description pretty the only thing worry about is it is very lightweight the quality seems cheap but it hasn proved that yet will only use it for office work so hopefully it will not wear out or go defective 
positive,great mouse got this because my laptop had to many wires sticking out everywhere this has been great to free up the mess of wires and make my work day easier 
positive,perfect sound for small speaker battery life and waterproof can beat the price
positive,so pretty and super quiet
neutral,the mouse broke couple days after the return window reached out and heard nothing back not fun throwing money away like that 
neutral,when first got it it did not track properly unless fully charged stopped using it and recharged it all last night and now it does not work at all lights flash for few seconds and then it goes black wish this product would have worked properly 
neutral,i use this product for my xbox am able to talk with my friends and hear the game 
negative,scroll wheel completely stopped working after two months the power cord also stopped charging the mouse after few weeks of use complete waste of money 
neutral,i like not having to replace batteries all of the time and also the sleek design and color 
neutral,it stopped working after months can even return it 
positive,my son has this exact same speaker and we were so impressed we ordered one for ourselves great sound great quality reasonable price 
positive,simple to use long battery life recharges by plugging into your computer this is the first mouse ve enjoyed using that wasn wired this works much better than the old battery opperated ones and has much longer battery life 
positive,love it slim line and fits in laptop bag much nicer than my old one and it pretty 
positive,this keyboard is nice and works perfectly the only thing don like about it is that you don have the option to keep the lighting on especially at night or playing games end up fiddling around finding out where am on the keyboard will keep it for backup but think will be looking for something with more lighting options 
positive,mouse is great bargain does everything it should do
negative,regularly stops tracking movement into disjoint and jerky cursor movement seems to depend on the color of the surface underneath based on my multicolor mousepad oem harassed me with emails about changing my review amazon leaked my email that was only given to amazon 
neutral,in order for your lights to work you would need hdmi extender to connect to your controller and or outlet
neutral,does not hold charge have to recharge every three days approximately 
positive,i really enjoy the mouse with the different colors that light up when clicking the left or right buttons on the mouse it is very quiet 
negative,mouse completely died and wouldn charge in less than month no return policy
positive,works perfectly colors are fun still running on the first charge but do turn it off if ll be away from the computer for long 
neutral,shoutout bengoooooooooo
positive,i love this speaker always use it and its amazing 
positive,super cute works great love the rainbow lights however it takes while to charge and the charge does not last long at all don even bother to use it anymore because it not even worth the hassle 
negative,this mouse is awful bought six weeks ago and one of them died in less than week the other just died got less than months out of these and now have to go looking again for more reliable one avoid this it looks nice but it doesn last
negative,the mouse worked immediately but stopped responding after minutes no troubleshooting worked laptop recognized the dongle the whole time but couldn move the cursor or click tried on an additional computer and still no luck 
neutral,works exactly how needed it to 
positive,great purchase as gift my brother love it for gaming great sound 
positive,works perfectly for work computer
positive,this is great product for cheap price it is light weight the rechargeable battery keeps charge very well only have to charge it couple times week and you can use it while it is charging sit about feet away from my pc tower or xbox and have no issues with it not responding this is also very nice looking product and looks exactly how the picture shows will buy this product in the future if need another one this also works for my xbox one which is awesome 
neutral,this mouse works but has high pitch noise the entire time in use drives me crazy 
positive,i like this speaker crisp clear sound with nice bass the only misleading part for me was the hr playtime after hours on moderate volume it was down to the nd to last light and it also says you can have something charging as well thru the usb highly doubt would have lot of battery in doing so nothing different in battery longevity compared to my other non jbl speakers except better sound 
neutral,clear sound quality
positive,i have been using this with my work laptop which use hours daily for remote work ve had this for few weeks and only needed to charge once since then really love the feel of it it near silent and very soft click sound when using buttons like the look of it and the lights so know when it in sleep mode turns on and immediately works with one click completely operational when plugged in to charge as well the charge cord is very short but plugged into the laptop to charge it and it was long enough for me to use it right next to the usb port it was plugged into without being nuisance would love for there to be way to see the battery life on the mouse it the only thing would change add very pleased and hope it lasts long while update this mouse is still going strong still love it use it daily for work day days week still love the lights lol my one and only complaint wish we could see the battery life of the mouse have been charging one every couple of weeks just to be safe hate the laptop mouse it does work when plugged in and charging tho so that is nice just prefer wireless im not knocking off stars due to this at all just offering suggestion to somehow let us see the battery life remaining 
positive,super easy to use just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the usb cord as needed kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise 
neutral,this item is trash do not waste your money have only been able to use the mouse once without issue just do not work at all now 
neutral,quiet typing no latency only issue is that it doesn stay charged for long stays charged for about days and light doesn show when it needs to be charged other than that it is pretty good keyboard 
positive,i like that you have the option to have the lights pulse in and out or keep it solid the keyboard does go dark if you don touch the keys energy efficient say the best part is how quiet the keys are definitely worth the price update lost the usb receiver for the keyboard and contacted klim directly they sent me new usb receiver for free amazing customer service from this company recommend 
positive,i don really like the long cord wish it was cordless
positive,it good size for the work it does great price
neutral,quit working already
positive,these work great for gaming can easily tell what direction sounds are coming from in cod and apex legends for first person shooter games these work great and are very comfortable 
negative,i only used it once until it was dead and then charged for hours it wouldn even turn on have tried keeping it plugged in restarting my computer and trying the mouse on different computer and it still doesn work and now of course it passed the time to return or get refund even though it cute mouse it doesn work and frustrated 
positive,then it continued to be cheap piece of junk mean should have known from the price it was to good to be true never got it to charge or do anything returned 
neutral,i actually just bought this for my online meetings and phone calls done via my laptop they work fine for that 
positive,i didn need the lights and everything it pretty annoying as the mouse wanders quite bit and won always listen to where you re trying to go 
positive,bought exchanged immediately due to sent broken one recieved replacement works sometimes won always work the other original purchase scrolly ball won register any movent good for months if you get one that works properly from the start 
positive, cute colorful small lightweight quiet soft clicks easy quick set up 
positive,i love this mouse so glad went wireless makes my desk so much more organized 
neutral,sound is excellent don know really about the battery life yet has made it through two golf outings for total of hours of music without being recharged but doubt it will last much longer on one charge at volume not big fan of the base of the unit very small and rolls around easily
positive,it is very comfortable and does not hurt ears like others do 
positive,the headset is very high quality and the price is actually cheap so you will get an amazing headset for few bucks this headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable microphone works good as well lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice this product is very good very happy with the purchase 
negative,the scroller broke and only used it about times in total the rest of the time it sits in my bag the lights are dim don like how small it is it does not have the best tracking the clicking is louder than expected it also just feels cheap would not buy it if could do it again go for more quality one somewhere else 
neutral,scroll wheel broke after very light use would not recommend would have been nice mouse otherwise 
positive,edit their customer service reached out after posted the review saying they changed manufacturers and asked me to give them another shot tried them again and while still can say they re noise canceling the sound and fit are excellent for the price the microphone quality is pretty nice too friend mentioned it makes gaming with me much easier lol all in all these are prolly headphones at price point and the customer service is incredibly responsive the sound is pretty good and they fit well but it blocks no sound whatsoever if that mainly why you re buying it you ll want to look elsewhere even with sound playing can hear background noise clearly
positive,its pretty good guess
neutral,stopped working after month
positive,i bought these for my daughter for easter and she loves them we usually go through at least pairs of gaming headphones year but after months they re still working perfectly and the sound is great 
positive,my husband headset he loved them 
positive,i actually use this keyboard for my workstation and it super awesome love it and don know what else to say about this product it super fun and it lights up when you re typing and it awesome
positive,omg in love with this charge the very first second pressed the play button amazing sound quality 
neutral,nice
neutral,did not work straight out the box 
positive,this mouse is great love that it is so compact being rechargeable is plus for me the lights make it fun to use 
positive, this is exactly what wanted cancels all noise in the background lights up and its my two favorite colors thanks amazon in love 
positive,i really enjoy the feel of the mouse it slick which has put less strain on my wrist but ll still be getting wrist support the colors don need to be turned on and when left in middle it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath 
neutral,caught this on sale and for the price the quality is unbeatable 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse great color matches my laptop perfectly love the color changing mode so fun 
positive,perfect
positive,great buy 
neutral,would suggest beginning gamers to use it
neutral,first of all none of the cords work plugging it both into the playstation controller secondly in order to talk in here you can do it simultaneously you have to change it each time course this would be pain in the ass but it never works garbage returning it tomorrow want full refund in the premier brand
positive,i needed an ultraslim mouse for my laptop and this one works great my only complaint if you can call it that is its length it would fit better in my carry case if it were shorter 
positive,this product is amazing the color looks great and stands out battery life is impressive only problem and reason not to give atar is the fact this product doesn include the plug in ac usb port only the cable 
positive,works well and the color matches my laptop perfectly 
positive,the klim is extremely quiet which is the number one thing that is important to me battery life is great plus it is rechargeable my only complaint is the connection would rate it about due to it sometimes randomly losing connection after two months my key is starting to rub off back light to the keyboard is perfect in my opinion price for the keyboard is really good think this keyboard will last about year for me overall great keyboard love it 
neutral,usb fell apart after uses 
neutral,stopped working days after the day cutoff for returns it worked great while could use it but of course this is unacceptable won buy from this seller again 
positive,i happy with my purchase it wasn an expensive mouse it wireless and rechargeable all things was looking for it is slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to only use it for office work tasks so can speak to other uses however don notice any lags delays or other issues do wish there was some way to control the colors but it not big deal also the top clear button clicks but haven figured out what that does 
positive,folks this speaker is amazing it really is waterproof accidentally ran it through my front loader washing machine in load of pool towels still plays great awesome 
positive,led wireless mouse rechargeable slim silent mouse is easy to use lightweight and easy to recharge the charge last long time 
neutral,this product simply doesn work the charger connection port is mishapen 
positive,what didn like is that the cord was too long but overall when am gaming the mike and sound quality are pretty good and don get me started on the great price 
positive,do they cancel out background noise not really but they are amazing headphones for the price just bought another one for my brother and have informed others to buy as well 
neutral,was very happy with this purchase until the left click button started getting stuck and having to force it to work don use the mouse aggressively and haven dropped or spilled anything on it design and looks are nice but not happy with it breaking so fast 
neutral,i used this mouse for work as am hybrid worker and do most work in the field or different workspaces when the mouse leaves my home office to go with me it has its own individual protective padded case in my work bag worked great until it just stopped working which is very disappointing after almost months the mouse still lights up looks like it works took charge from the charger but will not move on the screen in my work computer thinkpad or personal computer macbook that said either the mouse internally stopped working in some aspect or the usb dongle is defective per my it consultant tried all possible usb ports even those on my apple magic keyboard and still does not move on the screen also tried every idea could find to reset repair the issue in line to no avail it is disappointing and huge inconvenience this happened you would expect product to last more than months for my coworkers that asked about my mouse as they thought it was cool they will now be told it died only after short period of time and cautioned if they decide to buy one have yet to hear back from their customer service and not sure ever will maybe it is true after all you get what you pay for now need to buy another new mouse which was something hoped to not have to worry about for long time please keep in mind do not leave this review to bash the company this review is to let people know my experience with the mouse like said it worked great until it just stopped working still lights up just will not move on my screen for no apparent reason as it work the night before buyer beware 
positive,i have been using this keyboard for almost and half months and at first issues with finding the on off switch for turning on wireless and had to have both plugged into my computer for wireless and charging after found the switch on the back it made everything easier and more convenient would recommend this to anyone looking for good wireless keyboard with long battery life 
neutral,very good
neutral,for the size it got nice punch to the bass but the high ends are slightly muffled
positive,love jbl products their sound quality is awesome the bass is decent for bluetooth speaker better than most ve heard gets nice and loud too and battery holds up for quite while very happy with this one 
neutral,constantly disconnects from bluetooth sometimes several times in one song 
negative, bought this mouse as backup to keep in my laptop bag and foolishly didn try to use it until the return window had already passed it has never worked threw away my money ve tried syncing this mouse to multiple computers and devices with the same results nothing can find any info about the switch on the bottom or how to troubleshoot but when plug the mouse in to charge it it illuminates blue when actually try to use it it blinks red and shuts off it has never worked please don waste your money please learn from my mistake 
neutral,it turns on but the left button does not work
positive,i find this mouse easy to use fits my hand very well wear medium sized glove and moves fairly smoothly say fairly smooth because used mouse pad with smooth soft surface it seemed to drag just little when tried smooth hard surface it worked better you do have to click button to wake up the mouse when it goes to sleep mode my other one woke up with just moving it thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but dont even notice it would probably buy again 
neutral,i was enjoying the mouse but after days it malfunctioned and the rotary portion did not work 
neutral,the scroll broke within hours of taking out of package can still use it to open tabs but can scroll 
positive,absolutely love these headphones the cord gets in the way sometimes but the sound quality is very good and for the price love these bought red one and blue one for me and my son he loves them
positive,i use this on my playstation this is the best headset for gaming that have ever used great product 
neutral,do not buy this mic someone who always checks reviews with this device check the questions apparently you need an adapter to use the headset in the first place which the seller does not include secondly even with the adapter most say that the mic stops working after little while even with the adapter highly recommend avoiding this product 
neutral,while re chargeable the battery life is terrible feels cheap and does not track well tossed in in the rubbish and purchased and amazon basics mouse less expensive and far more capable alternative 
neutral,i do have to charge it about once every couple weeks or less that better than needing batteries suppose
positive,i very comfortable ergonomically feel internal rechargeable batteries and instant connection while setting up for the first time took less than seconds from taking it out of the box to working the button press is also really smooth and doesn feel like hard click the roller knob at the top is fairly smooth and the transitional led lighting looks really good very happy with this purchase
positive,our kids love it they can play each other in game on our ps and ps game systems they also love it for their kindles and school devices 
negative,i have had this mouse for while and have barely used it because the lag is so bad so so so so so bad it doesn follow it so slow it infuriating do graphic work and cannot have mouse that doesn act in real time do not recommend 
neutral,worked great at first but now the right click button does nothing am back to my track pad avoid this device cheap components
neutral,good sound if keep it on too long it hurts my ears might be too small for my giant ears
positive,great headphones for gaming with friends and family at great price
positive,perfect for your everyday gamer comfortable to wear and clear sound 
positive,i use this headset on my ps and it works amazing 
positive,it beautiful and sleek 
negative,couldn beat the price on this headset just wanted something cheap that would work decent of course it seems like pretty cheap plastic but it doesn really bother me they don hurt my head ears or anything like that when wear them for long periods of time unlike other headphones headsets they light up which is cool but you can plug that part into controller because it usb for the lighting overall haven had any complaints from the people play with online no comments about how bad it sounds or anything so assuming the mic works just fine and so does the sound that comes through the headset 
positive,definitely not quiet at all other then that it okay guess
positive,i am in love with my speaker 
positive,great sound and easy to pair with bluetooth only thing didn like was how long it takes to recharge would recommend in spite of charging time 
negative,i had similar mouse that lasted two years this one died after only month would work after charging for few minutes and then stopped 
positive,my son uses these for playing games and they work perfectly the noise canceling might be too good as find myself repeating my words haha 
positive,love love love this item light weight and very durable 
positive,this is the best computer mouse have ever bought like that you just recharge it 
positive,i love this mouse it is sleek and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand love that it lights up beautiful colors it is rechargeable so you don have to worry about finding batteries best purchase made highly recommend this mouse 
positive,great
positive,i love the colors and how light it feels product was exactly how it was described thank you 
neutral,satisfied
positive,perfect for day at the beach or river or anywhere bit bass heavy but am partial to that surprising bass response for such small unit charge your phones and still bump all day who made such witchcraft 
neutral,not at all good sound is tinny no bass can see why ratings were so low thought that reviewers meant it was good but they re not pass 
positive,good price funky colors clearly starts stuttering in response time when it ready to be charged perfect for my tiny home office kitchen counter space 
negative,problem with item and seller buyer beware scam items being sold as working good or like new no where did it say reduction in refund it item returned first contacted seller and it was broken english and wrong words being used in chat he told me to turn off item and reset well it wouldn hold charge and we couldn turn item on we could no do what he was asking then he got angry with me and said just return it then very unprofessional we had item before brand new no problems this seller sold damaged item like new and knowingly did feel he did because of how he acted in chat no excuse do not buy from this man woman 
positive,i have both of these speakers and like them both here the long and short of it so you don have to research million reviews the charge is larger louder and has more bass like this one because don care about the miniscule differences in quality of mid high low that won be noticed anyways since this is speaker for pools parties etc the charge is smaller less expensive and has truer sound where the quality comes across as slightly but noticeably higher it not as loud and doesn have as much bass as the charge which sounds noticeably less authentic than the charge unless you re tech guy the deal with drivers mono vs stereo etc doesn matter all that much do you want louder bassier speaker that can be heard from further distance on bike ride around campfire etc get the charge do you want truer more authentic sound at lesser price get the charge 
positive,great quality sound comfortable and durable
neutral,the mic apparently blips in and out 
negative,i love the feel and look of this keyboard but it randomly stops working and the key strokes aren transferred to the computer very frustrating 
positive,fast charger and beautiful design 
neutral,still testing them out
positive,good product awesome price
positive,love this mouse havent had to charge it at all since got it amazing
neutral,i bought this mouse to use with my macbook since it comes with type connector overall really like it the color matches my macbook and it slim so it fits in my little bag where keep my chargers in recommend this for office work but not for gaming your wrist gets tired since it really slim
positive,i have not had the keyboard long but it has nice feel and love the fact that it is wireless have small desk at home and can move it anywhere need it 
neutral,quit working already
positive,very nice very good for gaming and personal use it been more than two months been using and enjoying with this keyboard 
neutral,lasted months
positive,this keyboard works exactly as expected though it says it quite keyboard its fair amount louder than silent keyboard like the logitech one the led are nice and able to adjust the brightness find this helpful because work in dark room at my pc the dongle is able to connect easily and has good reception the keystrokes are reliable and the keyboard well built with not completely smooth keys personally like the small amount of texture on the keys the keyboard also goes to sleep after maybe minute to save battery life charged it when got it and have been using it for days with heavy use of those days all in all solid keyboard for reasonable price 
neutral,exactly as described
positive,great sound quality 
positive,very happy with item all of our teens have this speaker and they all love them
positive,this is the rd pair second through this account have bought and all three still work great my and year olds use these so you can just imagine the wear and tear they receive on daily basis and they work great little bulky on my youngest kiddo but it works as intended and has been durable 
positive,their customer service is fantastic absolutely worth it
neutral,it functions according to my expectation 
neutral,the mouse works great except the right button doesn always copy paste on various web pages after receiving the new mouse the problem is the web page design because the same problem occurs tried different brand mouse with the same result 
negative,the battery of this mouse works well haven timed it but have left it on overnight and it stills has battery not gamer but imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the pc setup recently switched from laptop that had the standard rectangular port usb to one that needed the adapter usb the adapter that comes with the mouse worked for about minute before it stop functioning so brought out my own adapter from different device and the mouse now works also tested both adapters with wired mouse it suffices to say that it was the mouse adapter that is not working could have gotten faulty one so the problem could be exclusive to me tl dr mouse adapter didn work ur screwed if urs doesn work either and don have an extra one 
positive,you will be needing to charge this keyboard every day ve had keyboards that lasted for months on single charge this is definately not one of them other than that it great keyboard 
neutral,as expected would buy again
positive,great gaming headset for my son 
positive,i bought this and tried it for several months this still works fine for both sound and mic performance is also good for the price my kids love this so bought another one 
neutral,for the price good product have not used it much yet but will suit the purpose for small portable mouse 
negative,it failed after one month have to have the charging cable permanently connected or it goes dead in addition it is rather bulky compared to other keyboards am sorry bought it and missed the return deadline by one day 
positive,excellent product easy to install and the keys are very soft it has very fast respond when playing shooting games
positive,works amazing for my son no complaints this was our nd purchase of these he now has one for each game system 
negative,bought this awhile ago to start setting up my home office didn need it right away so set the box aside pulled it out this weekend to discover that the keys don work correctly multiple keys are stuck together typing or displays tg for example keyboard is essentially useless but because didn examine it right away my return window has expired and stuck with junk that doesn work lesson learned 
positive,love that this is so colorful works great with my mac
neutral,sounds and looks great but in less than month the charging port melted and started smoking electrical malfunction of some sort 
positive,it very comfortable to use minimal noise
positive,i like the keyboard for all of its features except for one the enter key it difficult to touch type due to the weird shape of the key keep hitting the backslash key when really want to hit the enter key normally the backslash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key this won be problem for those who don touch type but for those of us who do it an impossible reach when trying to fly at words per minute for this reason don recommend this particular keyboard going to be looking for new keyboard 
positive,good mouse love the quiet clicks for working while kiddos are sleeping great price 
negative,one drop to the floor it broke 
neutral,just didn work for me could not plug into my chromebook 
positive,i bought this mouse so that could use it with my macbook unfortunately it barely works have tried for year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop it extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you re better off not using it at all 
positive,great
positive,i like that its wireless and the keyboard works like charm 
positive,overall happy with product
positive,i have not had this mouse for little over days love the feel of the mouse and how sleek it is however no matter how much charge the mouse it stops responding after about minutes of use have found myself removing the dongle from my laptop several times day just to make the mouse respond bought the mouse to improve my work functionality to no avail 
positive,the game sound and chat sound great fits alittle tight but it might just be that have big head definitely love this more than the dollar xbox headset got at walmart 
negative,wouldn take charge and charge light kept turning off just as bad the keyboard lighting wouldn stay on which defeats its whole purpose very disappointed and returning product 
neutral,nice mouse
neutral,i needed new mouse for my laptop and decided on this design based on its ergonomics however used to the taller mouse so it took some getting used to this design not completely sold on it but ll give it go 
neutral,only used it times and went to turn it on and won power up lasted days days past the return time they gave of days what waste of money thanks god it wasn much don waste dollar on it 
positive,this mouse works perfectly for my macbook enjoy the color changing effect lots of fun to use feels good in your hand 
positive,very nice headphone perfect for gaming
negative,i experiencing lot of glitches with this keyboard the worst is when typing text and using the enter key for line break and it just wipes out the entire app and loose everything ve never had so many missed types as with this keyboard contacted klim support and they requested short video of random glitch whoa my recommendation is to avoid this keyboard and klim as they try to be witty and cute and that not what you want when you have high priced cheap chinese keyboard marketed as premium product simply read the one star reviews for the truth on this keyboard 
positive,this mouse works excellent it easy to move very lightweight love the way it lights up excellent buy 
neutral,this is probably my second review in life because hate leaving them but very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after month of use don even use it every day hell don even use it every other day so this definite came as shock of course the return window is closed which go figure when you sell cheap mouse and the seller isn easily accessible like to think out of good character and business that would be able to replace this mouse as love the color and the lights on it but what the point if it no longer serves its purpose 
neutral,stand breaks to easily would probably not make purchase from this company again
positive,this product is amazing the sound is really clear the design make you look like pro gamer this headphone is flexible and it has the cushion for your head the previous ones own are kinda rigid so it normally broke near areas bending occurs one thing not fan of is where the headphone volume controller is placed also the headphone volume controller can sometimes makes the sound off like the left side is little louder then the right side 
positive,best bang for your buck literally
positive,i love this mouse so much bought another one love the soft click that it is rechargeable and the lights are great easy to install just stick the usb dongle into the computer and starr using probably the best mouse ve had 
neutral,this piece of junk must have program to discontinue working days after the return date you put on it of march battery will not hold charge guess will go back to buying from costco they give days return on electronics
neutral,the microphone on these headphones didn seem to work at first but then found it had to be in just the right spot which is not normal they also do not light up like the picture shows them doing this doesn affect how they are used but they shouldn advertise them lighting up 
positive,i use this when gaming on my pc and as my work headset when in traveling it doesn squeeze my ears too much even though ve got big head it sounds great and the mic works great too ve taken many meetings without any issues on this 
neutral,i have had this mouse for less than weeks it charges doesn work at all go buy name brand that will work for more than minutes 
neutral,worked great until today scroll wheel no longer works this is not even an item use more than three times month disappointing 
positive,honestly it far less heavy than would ve liked don feel as though this will be adequate for long term gaming but it ll be alright for web surfing or writing it also fairly small then again have pretty large hands for the price couldn ask for much more but do think it important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is also it does work with macbook air despite the one star reviews you have to connect the receiver to the adapter it takes good bit of force and then plug it into the computer wish the instructions could ve been more clear about that but it whatever 
neutral,this mouse works well and is small and quiet 
neutral,it stopped working after about weeks even after being fully charged 
positive,never got to actually use this for real my computer wasn built when initially bought it but it was functional at least with my laptop but soon as was ready to use it on my desktop it won work for anything the only reason am giving this more than star is the seller at least tried and replaced this receiver when thought that was the problem but unfortunately this is cheaply made keyboard and basically you get what you pay for don expect robust quality with this thing
positive,they give very go of sound the color is wonderful as blue is my favorite color best of all is they got my head
neutral,realy good headset but not the best noise cancelling still its good headset
positive,the mic broke off within year and they replaced the headphones without hesitation they were interested in how they could improve their product would definitely purchase again without worry as they stand by their products 
neutral,sound is muffled lights vibrant but useless unless you re connecting to laptop for gaming the split is too short to connect it to the console what makes it light up and simultaneously to the gaming controller what makes it useful so for gaming the lights will not be on while wearing the headset mic like so many other complaints doesn work returning this item 
neutral,ergonomic smooth and quiet this is the third one ve bought and ll never go back to another one charge lasts more than week and never turn mine off
positive,love this and use it all the time 
positive,clear sound bass is deep worth the price and delivery was on time 
neutral,it was great for the weeks it lasted after weeks it would light up as if it was charging but never would hold the charge 
neutral,doesn stay charged long and some functions don work 
positive,works great very reactive colors look fantastic while they go through all the different colors as well as has an option for just red if you re not feeling fancy
neutral,mic did not work
neutral,quiet and just what was looking for
negative,product looks great but it came broke and box was destroyed should have sent it another box instead of soft package
neutral,i bought this for working at home like my room dark and needed lighted kb problem is kb light shuts off after seconds of inactivity no option to stay on or stay on longer 
positive,love how lightweight it is just light tap to right and left click mouse tracks greats and the led lights are cute plus it pink and priced super brought this one for my work pc and buying second one for my macbook 
positive, don use the color changing feature so with that the battery life lasts really long time say that because purchased this may and my battery just now needs charged december and use this days week for work hours day love this product no noise sleek comfortable just love it worth it hands down 
neutral,a very well made mouse responsive with no lag only issue is the lack of adaptability no buttons so all procedures are what manufacturer has set in like the wireless operation and the lack of batteries 
positive,we used this on family campout and had great results the volume range is great sound quality is great and connectivity with our iphones is great the extra charge capacity is very handy as well 
positive,this unit works perfectly for what needed can bluetooth music over the air or wire into the aux to mix music in daw in real time without bluetooth latency went for the charge specifically for the aux so far no issues recorded track today with key midi keyboard and the headphone out of my computer to the charge works like charm 
neutral,loved the product look and that it was rechargeable however the battery didn hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of wireless mouse also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use returning item and going back to logitech brand 
positive,sound quality is very good better bass response than my charge good battery life rugged waterproof good max volume level overall an excellent product the only downside is it bit too large to fit in bicycle bottle cage charge works well for that purpose 
positive,the mouse is comfortable to move it goes to sleep while in zoom teams call however easily wakes up with one click 
positive,jbl speakers have been great this is my third 
positive,i recently got job working from home and needed mouse to accompany purchased the rose gold it is beautiful came on time and hooked up with no issues if you want to use the color changing lights make sure to flip the switch on the bottom of the mouse all the way to the sunshine symbol took me few to figure that out but otherwise great product 
positive,this speaker is great if you want big boom out of smallish speaker this is big step up from the flip with how loud it gets the battery life is amazing and stays alive for long time 
positive,love job products battery life is amazing last pretty much hours use it in my home gym no complaints at all
neutral,i ve only had the speaker since february it already crackling use it in my work office it never up loud and it already blowing not happy at all 
positive,it sleek and comfortable and the battery lasts forever once charged it great and it fits anywhere 
positive,i absolutely love this mouse it well built and has so many features that similarly priced mice don have it so whisper quiet and smooth as can be it also rechargable which helps out ton 
positive,i bought this as christmas gift for my wife so far so good as far as quality workability and battery life 
positive,they do the job for sure but then you can expect it because of the price but for the price they are nice
positive,great product and very happy with my purchase quiet buttons when pressed and love the different color lights 
positive,super easy to use and transport works with my pc
neutral,it amazing how only good reviews can be posted but when buyers getting scammed out they hard earned money and want to complain about that the review can be posted 
neutral,the first day it worked great but the second day it barely tracks at all and when try and click on anything to open documents or emails it takes several tries before it works what waste of money going back to my old mouse 
positive,awesome headset for gaming at great price 
positive,loud great quality bass is everything strongly recommend 
positive,not using this keyboard for gaming just liked the colors and wanted wireless keyboard that fit my desk everything works so far happy 
positive,this was nice mouse wouldn recommend for children as it broke when dropped on floor adult use seems like it would be fine 
neutral,this is exactly what was looking for 
negative,battery life is no good followed manufacturer procedure for the initial charge frequent disconnect from usb adapter lighting is about the only good thing constantly missing keystrokes while typing as it is right now as write this claims to be quite typing nope don get that either hard of hearing and its annoying would look somewhere else should ve returned it
neutral,sound doesnt expect as wanted
positive,love this thing and an audiophile 
neutral,well worth the price 
negative,the keyboard feels great looks great but it not nearly special enough for how often it needs to be plugged in it has died on me in the worst situations never any sort of warning and happens roughly once every weeks would much rather have hardwired or battery operated keyboard than this battery life is frankly unacceptable
positive,sensor doesn always pick up movements to clarify am not using this gaming but as wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate sometimes when sit for too long the sensor takes time to come back online andreas movements this can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from mouse overall you are doing menial office tasks this is probably an okay mouse the rechargeable batter is cool and am happy to not have to replace batteries but would probably go with wired mouse in the future 
positive,the mouse is really pretty but the battery life is super short it doesn even last my hr workday after full charge 
positive,had some issues with my first headphones purchased and customer service reached out to me to rectify the situation and the new pair they sent is amazing pleasantly surprised with the quality thank you guys again for going above and beyond for your customers 
positive,grandson loves him
positive,awesome speaker
neutral,has ear phone input option good sound quality long battery life
positive,its been less than months but the mouse has already popped open and doesn work just wish it would last longer 
positive,this speaker is easy to use it also has excellent sound quality 
positive,good value headset honestly the quality is much higher than expected 
neutral,the sound is amazingly good did not believe good sound could come from this sized speaker 
positive,this charge is really great in terms of sound quality and battery life glad got it for my traveling back to nigeria 
neutral,sound quality is too good can hear myself think 
negative,at the start noticed that they weren that loud even with the volume on ignored it though because it wasn that bad regret doing that because now they got even lower with the sound on this product isn worth buying 
negative,item must ve been defective or something because in was it stopped working charging and pretty much would my work at will also the returns process with this vendor sucks it not via amazon had to go twice to ups because had to print the label or pay to print on site then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in if would ve paid little bit more for higher quality would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle save yourself the grief and get one little bit more upscale 
neutral,very cool keyboard works great but after couple of weeks after return window closed it will only work when plugged into power kinda defeats the point of having wireless keyboard 
negative,don bother with this one it looks fine but the padding it very uncomfortable the sound is terrible not worth the money at all will be returning this
positive,i like too much this product great sound and good connectivity battery lasts forever 
neutral,not worth it
neutral,i have never used it because everything is in chinese even the machine it self 
neutral,it was working great at first but now it not working ve had this mouse for about month 
neutral,i do presentations for work and can plug my lap top into the television and use the mouse to advance slides 
neutral,good sound quality

neutral,stopped holding charge after only one week
positive,this thing gets loud it the best of both worlds because you get something light and easy to carry but still get amazing sound battery on the beach goes hours consistently and we like our music loud also like that my wife and can both sync our phones to it at the same time and switch from phone to phone with my old speaker we could only have phone synced at time and we always had to go through the process of disconnecting the current phone then re sync the new phone by putting the device in find new device mode now it simple process to turn the bt off on her phone and mine will automatically connect because it already synced vice versa to connect her phone back to it

negative,seriously the worst keyboard ve used in years of pc gaming including novelty keyboards micro keyboards that fit in one hand keyboards from the with the pin conectors this keyboard shuts off and disconnects from the dongle often and repeatedly even with clear los of the dongle it will not stay connected only buy this keyboard if you want your character to just stand there and die while you furiously mash buttons though that by putting couple more dollars in than the minimum could avoid products like this but am disgusted with the product quality here would return this product if didn intend to smash it with hammer when but an upgrade this week in sick attempt to reach some sort of closure on how awful this products is do not buy this keyboard 
neutral,it great looking keyboard but when you are typing random keys just start repppppppppppppppeating ve tried making corrections in my computer setting window but nothing works tossed the original box it came with so stuck with it now but beware this product 
positive,it was important for me to have mouse that not only could see in the dark but something that was quiet also enjoy the fact that this mouse is rechargeable so this mouse will last me for the long run the light up feature is huge plus something didn know would appreciate since tend to work on my laptop in the dark great quality overall 
positive,i use this mouse for work it didn require any weird setup like downloading software it super comfy and has sleep mode that activates after about minutes click of the button wakes it up and it ready to go don regularly use the light up mode but it is cool feature that is fun to show off have carpal tunnel and it so much better on my wrist than standard wired computer mouse most definitely worth the purchase

positive,these do not work with computers windows does not recognize them and no software exists to help you can hear people but the mic does not let people hear you they work great on laptops the mic and lights are problematic noise canceling and comfort are spot on with everything except computers 
negative,i work from home and work hours day depending if do overtime or not so needed mouse because my wireless mouse of years was dying now got this mouse in hopes it would work great because of all the reviews the first day got this mouse it was very uncomfortable so right off the bat knew didn like flat mouses because it was cramping my hand second the cursor was glitching unfortunately cannot attach video because it would be on company property and don have personal computer ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other if you like mouses like this and can deal with the glitching then that fine but for me hated it very frustrating 
neutral,i liked the fact that it uses no battery but the charge does not last too long 
negative,this item is poorly made battery died within minutes after full charge hours it was returned the same day it was delivered 
positive,its great except the cord is way too long there should be no reason why its as long as it is and ve tripped on it couple of times foot tall and it gotten caught under the wheels of my gaming chair other than that it works fine

positive,it sounds great
positive,arrived fast high quality headset has an awesome cord and nice volume control you gotta try this headset out 
negative,there is no audible warning when the battery is low the indicator lights are at the bottom of the speaker the way you know is when the speaker turns off in the middle of the night and you fumble with the charger while the speaker keeps turning off until the battery gets charge sound quality is nothing special considering the price and the jbl brand 
positive,bought as gift she loved it 
neutral,the scroll wheel stopped working after weeks

neutral,the mouse worked great in the initial few weeks but then started having lag in movement and slowly it became so slow in movement that the click also stopped working of the time disappointed as bought this item after reading numerous positive reviews 
neutral,this mouse last me like month or two im not able to scroll up using this mouse will not buy again
positive,letters are small and faint even with the back lighting perhaps there is way to increase the brightness
neutral,update seller has sent multiple emails asking me to remove this review in exchange for money claiming this is an email from amazon costumer service this is the nd purchase for me the first one wasn labeled upgrade it lasted about months until dropped it on the floor this one the upgrade doesn work well at all the left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages the connectivity was also delayed despite trying different computers and different settings the problems persisted returned the upgrade 
positive,overall happy but wish the bass was little more powerful
neutral,this is gift for xmas so havnt used
neutral,about weeks after return window closed quit working completely should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day spent lot of time fooling around with mouse tool that should be something you don have to think about or make plans to be available for use going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about year and no hassle 
neutral,lightweight easy bluetooth connection the glow adds an extra pizzazz 
positive,bought this for my husband and he loves it and all the lights

positive,this is nice streamlined mouse it is responsive and rolls smoothly
neutral,it works well functionality wise for me but the lights don work it just stays red and the light is very blinky jittery
negative,bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it not perfect match it still very pretty and love the lights it is very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse update so received this mouse exactly days ago and the scroll button is broke went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver very small btw it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in so not only did my brand new less than week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making fort nox screw not happy save your money

positive,the sound quality is good for the price but it is not very comfortable headset all of my freinds were always telling me to get new mic and finally understood why after hearing myself on the mic it so loud with the most annoying echo have to hook up separate mic if want to play games with freinds and the headset just isn even that comfortable with the mic turn off option mot even working half the time it mostly what you expect for the price but ve gotten headsets as good for the same price so do not recommend honestly have no idea why this headset is so recommended it really isn that great at all 
positive,my life has changed the sound quality of this battery is perfect for my space look we would all like perfect sound quality but the truth is so many factors determine sound quality especially the recording itself the jbl offers greatvpower turning down the volume usually helps with balancing the sound when played at higher levels winner 
positive,i like you the place is good it sounds good and your quality of your merchandise it good
neutral,purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port no batteries required it is also compact with low profile it will be great for travel because it will take up very little space fits easily in pocket without bulging out 
neutral,i am enjoying my colorful mouse however my mouse connected to the computer of someone else while in use during class have also been having trouble connecting to my personal computer when am by myself 
neutral,the mouse is so smooth and responsive when it died it wouldn take charge so is now useless about what expected for being so cheap pretty color though

neutral,it does what it supposed to do 
positive,it not the best but for its price its excellent
positive,i like this headset really do after about an hour of wearing the headset it starts to hurt my ears little bit not that the volume is too loud but maybe because have big head and big ears for the price the quality is great the seller did everything as promised and shipping was on point 
neutral,no battery life 
positive,i love that its wireless and it has backlight so can use it at night without turning on light 
positive,the sound and bluetooth quality is great

neutral,i used for mins and it stopped working the lights were on my pc detected the dongle but mouse didn work initiated the return
positive,the headset barely fit on my head after constant adjustment and tweaking would have to put pair of socks on top of my head in order for it to be comfortable and fit

neutral,even with sleep mode the battery doesn last full work day 
neutral,this is good for its price but if you want quality look for some higher costing ones 
neutral,i really like this keyboard the keys are soft and the back light colors are not too bright 
negative,i just upgraded from budget wired keyboard to this my first wireless keyboard pros types quiet keys are responsive and smooth old budget keyboard was hurting my fingers from extended use feels light and minimalist had long sittings without needing to recharge with backlight turned off it uses usb charger cons no dedicated buttons for volume etc there are function shortcuts fn key for volume control and calculator this is nitpicking but guess rather have the dedicated buttons for one press instead of hitting the two combined the lighting has distinct high pitched noise that is audible and frustrating had to turn it off completely didn buy it for the backlight but it still shame that can ever use it 
negative,feels very cheap and performs cheap too both sides stick together when wanting to use just the left side button but they both go down and pop wen going back up difficult to click on just single item 
positive,i love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn run by batteries this seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double but then you have to think about remembering to charge it if you ve been using it all day non stop it starts to die by the night time other than that think it super cute and it pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces didn have much of an issue 
positive,son loves it 
neutral,the mouse worked fine at first then the battery stopped holding charge for long time after month it stopped working completely

positive,my son loves it 
positive,my son loves this headset in particular he broke his first one and was so happy to see it at an actual lower price than had purchased before he loves the led features and how clear the sound is will continue to buy this brand everytime he rages in fortnite 
positive,great speaker and great seller only con have found with this speaker is only having driver speaker it looses the stereo effect of the charge which has two very slightly smaller speakers the low tones are better and deeper the charge but it looses alot of high tones the charge picks them up great ll be ordering in near future to link with the for full rounded sound but the bass is lot better with the still really good sound and great volume eith the

positive,no one problem so far it works perfectly and the look is amazing
neutral,he hasn complained about them so it plus 
positive,great price solid sound and mic quality
negative,when first received this charged it as recommended and it lit up so seemed to work as expected after charged put the toggle in my usb port and nothing happened it didn download anything it didn pair with my laptop let it sit then tried again nothing it won charge it won light up nothing never even used it and it stopped working very disappointed and total waste of money 
positive,i love the color and the light the most it so easy to use and the best part is not having to download drivers 
neutral,my sons headset has suddenly stopped working he cant hear anything and just got the headset about weeks ago anyone else experience this 
positive,i love it
neutral,bought for christmas for video games and already they don work only months later
positive,it super quiet have it plugged in through hub adapter to google slate tablet and it worked immediately no issues at all lights up and color changes which is just cool add on feature no complaints here very portable 
neutral,the first day received the product it worked very well though couldn get seem to get it to charge it had enough juice to get through the first day so wasn too concerned by the second day though something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn move the cursor and never moved it as fast as it should the buttons all seem to work fine still but without the ability to actually move the mouse as want to it pretty useless 
neutral,it does not bring the wall charger as the charge did minimum cost for manufacturer but big problem for the consumer hope they are not trying to put quality down in all components as well 
positive,love this it feels like an extension of my hand 
neutral,really comfy and good sound
neutral,use these everyday considering another set to gift 
neutral,i like that it rechargeable unfortunately the scroller on top doesn work used with both my macbook and laptop 
neutral,don buy
positive,first of all the keyboard is far from silent every time hit the space bar there is loud and very audible clack secondly just know that you can change the color scheme it just rainbow colored the whole time you can change the brightness and the speed it breathes but that it on the plus side it was ergonomic and comfortable for the minutes used it before unplugging it and preparing it for return so there that guess all in all like said returning it this is not what wanted or expected 
positive,works great but wish it came with mounting straps
positive,perfect mouse for my laptop thin and easily stored it tracks great and fits into my hands very comfortably sleep mode prevents battery drainage if forget to turn it off after use highly recommend 
neutral,the mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user mine did not come with the type receiver assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling the most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again you have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer lot there is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up it seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click button to start moving again slight annoyance not bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that am used to using the colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick 
positive,great headphones to replace those expensive astro as
negative,literally only had the mouse for three days and used it on the first day and now it has stopped working it doesn charge plug it up and it may charge for minutes then it just stops charging then when go to turn it on it just turns on and instantly turns off this mouse is literally piece of crap will be getting my money back 
positive,it was great mouse until it stopped working and charging literally only used it about times since buying it and when put it on the charger this last time it just completely stopped working the charger light wouldn come on and it wouldn charge even switched usbs to see if it maybe had short in the wire and still nothing now that reading other reviews see the problem wish would have read them thoroughly before buying it buy this only if you want something short lasting with pretty colors other than that don recommend this at all 
negative,the tracking on this mouse is not great and to add insult to injury the mouse stopped working after about months worse yet missed the return window by days 
positive,i loved this mouse until it quit working three weeks after using am unable to return it due to return window tried different mouse pads and notebooks hoping was just the material it was sensitive to 
positive,works great on my desktop good battery life and sleep mode works seemlessly good value recommend 
neutral,it good mouse 
negative,purchased in july by november it would no longer charge mail to seller sent to address in the instructions would not go thru mail said that recipient server did not accept our requests to connect would not buy from this seller ever again 
positive,this is my th or th jbl charge that we have purchased either for us or for gift to someone else love how you can connect all of them together for an exceptional sound experience battery life is very long too would highly recommend 
positive,i really like the slim size it fits into ravel bag nicely love that it can be turned off for travel and not have to remove the battery the colorful lights are nice touch 
neutral,got this for my husband for christmas and he uses it all the time he loves it and it works great worth the money update it was worth the money until it just stopped working so my husband only uses it to listen to music while he taking showers and it sits on the windowsill that three feet away from the shower so it doesn get wet and he regularly charges it one day two weeks ago he tried to connect to it before shower and it saying it connected but not playing anything he let it charge turned it in and off and it still not doing anything really thought this would be worth the money especially with how much he loved it but apparently they just stop working after two months do not recommend this purchase sad to have spent so much on it 
neutral,nice product
positive,it works great like the color 
neutral,this headset is the worst for gaming no stereo so there is no difference if the enemy is on the right or left you can hear it as one sound the noise cancellation is amazing to the point you are screaming just so people can hear you talking normal sound quality is ok besides that useless hanging usb plug for lights don have small head and don have huge head and it slides down off my ears after some time it snug for about an hour super light weight plastic junk when received them thought what was in the box was pack of masks wait and save your money and buy something that is actually worth your money for years to come 
positive,i love how it lights up and is comfortable for for my hand 
neutral,item as described 
positive,i was searching for wireless mouse on amazon and for the price this was no brainer received this mouse in the mail in small compact packaging very simple and easy to get it going the charging cable that it comes with charged the mouse in about hours once plugged it in the mouse lit up blue and turned off once it was fully charged purchased the gray to match my laptop looks good and not as shiny as thought it would be which is great very comfortable with it in my hand and have pretty big hands really receptive to the movement when scrolling the lights feature is cool if you want to have something different the silent mouse clicking is great feature as well if you ever have to do work in quiet space you will not hear the loud clicking noise coming from this mouse very satisfied with this purchase so far 
positive,got this for my son and he absolutely loves it he has it on his head all the time even when he not really using it he said the sound quality is great and it very comfortable 
neutral,i not fan of frustration maddening trying several times and techniques to get this thing to connect 
negative,the mic had very low input signal when it worked but mostly it would cut out and not work at all 
positive,i had jbl portable speaker like this and it developed problems after months well past the warranty the company offered me off coupon on the purchase of my next one but unfortunately it still came out more cost effective to buy new one from amazon so bought from amazon great sound easy to charge can knock it just wish company would have replaced it for less than the projected cost for me 
negative,stopped working after months what waste 
positive,great portable mouse the color changing is fun and setup was easy lightweight ergonomic device it was also great value 
neutral,it was nice until it stopped working the return window literally closed yesterday
positive,keys were really nice and slim the letter inside was also delightful it been months and still haven had to charge it it great 
neutral,the mouse has nice small design and like how it feels when you click but unfortunately the hardware is not high quality the charging port has stopped working 
positive,this headset is by far the best one after trying couple of devices great for school and gaming 
neutral,i don use for gaming
positive,they work super well my ps best headset ve gotten so far
neutral,good
neutral,it stopped working after falling on the floor 
positive,there nothing special about it and the only reason got it was cause of the positive reviews it the perfect gift for child that it nothing else 
positive,i think that for the price it was its extremely good if your looking for cheaper headset to do the exact same as an expensive headset recommend this one very good noise cancelation as well
positive,these headphones are great value for the price of once put the headphones on was so surprised of the sound quality and noise reduction first listened to music on it and it was not so bad then started playing video games and it was better than headset got then returned on amazon 
neutral,item came broken definitely looks used tried to charge and use still but scroll doesn work 
positive,what liked about the headphones is they are good for my games if there is bass or low tones the headphones feel like they shake bit however the headphones are only ok when cancelling noise can still hear some vehicles drive by outside it is my own fault for not reading the description carefully but what do not like about the headphones is that they need usb attachment and you have to plug it in for the lights the usb thats attached to it as cord is really short but over all like them
neutral,i got the usb receiver but no mouse in the box 
neutral,this mouse worked great until it didn the scroll wheel no longer works use this mouse at my home office so haven been particularly rough with it where could understand something breaking after less that year of use 
neutral,keyboard went out when drop of coffee landed on the space bar turned upside down and blew it out half the keys don work now 
positive,very cool design thanks
negative,this mouse only stayed charged for hours if that long not very helpful when working hours day 
negative, new keyboard came with seal broken and dongle missing rendering this keyboard all but useless looks like it might have been decent product but not really confident in this distributor 
positive,i like the sleep feature for battery preservation as well as the backlight it smart about how it manages all of that the range is great able to use this from about away in my living room for use with the big screen while my laptop was tucked away under in my entertainment center works well while charging if needed also highly responsive while gaming no delays noted 
neutral,i use it to join conferance calls at home decided to buy it after borrowing my sons headset which he uses for gaming 
positive,i don like the way its been sound when music is on it skip some small parts of the music it sounds like the fake once what like about is the style and how its super loud 
negative,the usb port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for days there was nothing that happened that would have should have caused the usb to break other than it being poorly made am very disappointed with the outcome 
positive,i love this wireless mouse it super cute modern and goes perfect with my macbook love the colored lights as well and it fast 
positive,the low profile of the mouse can cause wrist and hand fatigue and unwanted inadvertent right clicks quiet as mouse literally subdued clicks nice led lighting and rechargeable pretty good deal for the average low price 
neutral,this mouse is ridiculously cheap do not buy garbage 
positive,i love the fit of the headphones and the extra padding the sound controls on the cord are easier to use than other headphones gamers that am playing with said that my sound isn as clear as my previous headphones 
neutral,this keyboards look nice and lighted up from the outside but when it comes to using it it is very unreliable and will stop working on you unexpectedly bought this back in early decemebr soon got it it was not connecting to my laptops made sure keyboard was fully charged and ready to go and tested it on two different laptops and nothing reached out to their it customer service and said the dongle has stopped working and would send me another one in days had to wait days for replacement mind you am working from home and really giving this keyboard chance dongle came followed the intructions and reset the keyboard and it worked this was by end of december its february and it stopped working today so far it lasted little over month before having the same issue all over again this is huge waste of time especially when having to work from home and having to stop and try to reset and test with multiple computers and still nothing this time it can be the dongle when inserted it reads int he computer do not recommend 
positive,ordered for my grandson and it was perfect 
neutral,for self entertainment
positive,this speaker is perfect for outdoor or inside parties the bass is good the sound quality is excellent very good portable speaker 
positive,perfect for gaming noise cancellation and great sound quality 
positive,this mouse is amazing it has completed my work from home station and has made my desk look less cluttered what love about it the most is the led lights would never definitely buy and recommend this to other people 
neutral,bought this keyboard for my son who wanted wireless for gaming we let it charge for full day the first day it was fine though my son thought the lights would stay lit while he was using it the second day it was lagging in its responses we charged it again which helped but not for long we returned it 
negative,they stopped working after month not worth it sound quality is not so great definitely don recommend for gaming 
positive,great mouse use it for everything from gaming to normal use recommend it
neutral, it is nice mouse but it is not changing colors it only shows red
neutral,mouse was advertised as quiet but it is far from quiet it has the loudest sound have ever heard from mouse when clicking the middle button disappointed in the clearly false advertising 
neutral,hearing was phenomenal but static here and there
negative,i bought it in september and didn receive it not until september we are at october end it already went out not even month it started at the end of september with not keeping charge so kept cord in and charged during the day while working on it then stopped working turned off and on and just completely stopped 
neutral,it was ok while it worked prefer battery to having to charge it via usb only worked months and the roller mechanism broke 
positive,great speaker
positive,the major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent it lasts only about hours for me guessing the one got may be defective because need to have this plugged in all the time to make it usable but can work that way not factoring in the battery everything else is great in comparison to other mice in this price range 
positive,love this mouse works perfect
neutral,the is ver good live it
positive,the low profile of the mouse can cause wrist and hand fatigue and unwanted inadvertent right clicks quiet as mouse literally subdued clicks nice led lighting and rechargeable pretty good deal for the average low price 
negative,all can say is that use it lot this is going to sound stupid but really don remember the last time charged it mean don use it everyday but at least to tines week for at least couple of hours sometimes bring it in my garage as am working on project so it will be on for to hours it still shows lights for charge just told the wife the other night as we were listening to it on the deck that cant believe it still has charge 
neutral,i was trying to play the ps with my friend but couldn here him and he couldn here me 
neutral,keys are too soft and flimsy and the worst part is they don always register chucked the box already so not sure if can return this any more but it cheap guess ll just keep using it as backup 
positive,strong connection all month without recharge 
negative,this keyboard is thoroughly average you press keys and the computer reacts there are no glitches the backlight turns on so you can see the keys in the dark as advertised unless it goes to sleep there is nothing to set this keyboard apart in fact it is lacking in some ways for example there is no way to determine how much batter power you have left which is inexcusable for wireless gaming input device there is nothing worse than discovering your keyboard is dead in the middle of gaming session they did not even need to write software to display this information windows can display it if the device simply provides it am also not fan of the key layout they got creative with the placement of the backslash key instead of being in its normal position above the enter key they pushed the quote key to the left and jammed backslash in between that and enter enter has been stretched up to backspace the end result is that if you try to type backslash or pipe characters say when entering paths or escape characters or coding you wind up hitting the enter key instead possibly times since you re typing without looking on instinct don know how many times have tried to type in path an inadvertently submitted the wrong path to the os by pressing enter instead of backslash very frustrating the quote key being shifted to the left is also very annoying but not quite as bad if you are developer this keyboard will slow you down for this reason alone particularly if you then go to work and use keyboards with standard layout maybe others are different but the absolute last thing want in keyboard is less than standard key layout it renders useless years of accumulated intuition and experience 
positive,i bought this product for the lighted keyboard and when recieved it was impressed on how much like it the sleep feature is very good exactly what was needing use it alot at night and don need extra lights turned on now 
positive,this is my favorite mouse because of the color and lighting it is so cute and comfy to use there is charger to charge which prefer over battery 
positive,comfortable fit great product nice sound
neutral,works fine nothing special and not quite as smooth as standard mouses you can get at big box stores for 
neutral,good job
positive,used this for work and it perfect quick and responsive cute appearance and very light battery life last good amount of time before requiring charge love the lights 
positive,great sound clear voice
positive,i ve had many headsets over the years and this one sound quality is right up there with the best of the mid priced headsets however the quality of the outgoing sound from the microphone is horrible have played with the same group of friends and they can barely tolerate the sound of my voice when playing ve tried tweaking the voice settings on my computer and have been unable to fix it when using my old headset there aren any issues other than microphone quality the headset it above average 
positive,i bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of pain to use the mouse is slightly small in my hand but is still comfortable and tracks well really appreciate that it charges from micro usb cable great value for the price 
neutral,this is pretty decent set for the price 
positive,i was looking for another headset because the one was using wasn working how it should and when saw this one with all the good reviews decided to try it and this headset rocks for the price love the sound dial and the mute switch use it for ps but the lights would be cool if were on pc pretty light weight and it overall seems like it decent quality headset would definitely buy again if something happens to this one 
positive,great sound 
neutral,i thought the sound was going to be louder than the old model but not so decided to return it it too expensive 
positive,it is super comfy and love the lights around it small enough for my hands highly recommend this mouse 
negative,i returning mine after just months sound quality is bad sounds like the the bass is vibrating so crazy can hear what is being said and it is very annoying 
neutral,it never would charge 
positive,only way listen to my music now other than when walk easy to use great sound 
neutral,family time entertainment we use up battery quickly
positive,mouse works fine and the grandkids love them they mainly use them for school work and for gaming 
negative,doesn charge fast the scroll broke within days the mouse completely stopped working after few weeks it constantly would stick 
neutral,full charge lasts two hours or less if you want to use it all day you have to charge it three to five times and of course can use it while it charging buying different wireless mouse today 
positive,love it
positive,lot of good sound quality from little size perfect fit in my bike beach basket 
positive,bought these after my kids broke my sony gold headset while these do not have as great features at the gold headsets as don offer as well sound quality and noise cancellation while also being wireless expected step down in quality as was purchasing something to bare the damage they might face until my kids and cats could learn to mind others things while they are step down surprised at how much like them like the volume control on the cord rather than the headset so can see if it if need to and while not as great they do have some noise cancellation there isn much base nor any surround sound features but for this price point think that would be asking for too much overall happy with them and until feel the need to get more expensive pair these will be what use will definitely hold onto them as backup pair if ever do upgrade as well 
neutral,the first one had defective charging cord connector very loose and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally both were returned under warranty and won be reordered again neat but not good quality 
negative,it has too much lag it slow that why hate it
positive, update this mouse is garbage wrote my review after one day of good functionality but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently buttons don always work when click something if take out the usb and turn on off the mouse it fixes it for few minutes until it goes into sleep mode the first one they sent me didn work at all and this new one just doesn work it works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff ordering something else the mouse works great for my dell laptop fits comfortably sleek profile no problems the button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse had an issue with my first shipment but customer service was very responsive problem solved with me and then shipped me new mouse very quickly 
positive,amazing speaker good price
positive,i been cheap with my headsets but been looking for one to replace one that broke and paid lot of money for this one is really good if you play cod loek me its important to hear where the footsteps and coming from well here you go this is the best headset you will get for the reasonable price
positive, the mouse is very bright in the dark love the aesthetic of it it very sleek and looks nice with my laptop the battery lasts pretty long it stays on red when you need to charge it love that it is rechargeable so no need for batteries 
neutral,sounds great but not for the outdoor construction workers 
positive,high quality great comfort glows as shown buy it 
negative,i received the mouse and it worked great for hours but now will not turn on or function at all have tried charging it multiple times with no success very disappointed 
positive,excellent
neutral,it was great while it worked with the first one that got then it started not working and messaged the sellers and they send me another one tell me how the new one didn work at alllll such terrible product don waste your money or your time trying to make it work 
neutral,i recently just bought this headset for my xbox when went to test it out the wire was way to long for gaming and when tried using it all can hear are cracks every time talk don buy this ever go for different pair 
positive,great customer service and decent headset for the price 
neutral,the mouse is not large enough and does not hold charge for long 
neutral,i liked this product until is stopped working months later 
positive,product is easy to use and has great sound quality
neutral,the voice not as high as excepted but it did the jop liked the design didnt like the yellow shade though 
neutral,sound really good 
positive,i really like this speaker for our kitchen speaker it sits on window sill sounds great and is super easy to use what more can you ask for in small speaker 
neutral,i bought this mouse for work and gaming the first one that arrived broke within the first week of using it the scroll wheel broke returned it and got replacement now the scroll wheel on the replacement mouse has broken and the return window has closed if you re looking for wireless mouse do yourself favor and spend little extra for quality that won break after month or two 
neutral,i made the mistake of reading the reviews only after bought the mouse because it had stars with something like reviews so thought it was fine saw few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review that made me really regret buying from such an unethical business don think you should buy this mouse even if you re on budget there much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs this mouse is very cheaply made as for performance issues for one it way too thin and lightweight when using it it very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it not heavy enough or grippy enough on the bottom to stay where you put it ve never had this issue with mouse before the tracking sensor is also way too sensitive the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse decent couple centimeters above the surface it on this also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it still tracking movement when you lift it up the cord to charge it is pretty short although that not huge issue just sort of disappointing the biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes bit of manhandling it felt like was going to break some of the cheap thin plastic when first plugged it in as for looks the edges where the paint or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough and it even came with some of the paint chipped off bought the light pink mouse it not nearly as light as it is in the pictures it darker and much warmer toned rather than cool light pink like the picture it also not as reflective as the pictures show but that not huge deal you can turn off the rgb lights by the switch on the bottom if you want but it still emits red light when using it wish it didn do that it ugly and probably wastes more power 
positive,great mouse love the lights when using it 
positive,i like the sound quality and comfortable fit
positive,great sound not completely sound canceling but not bad thing as my partner is always trying to get my attention and now if he close enough can still hear him over the game the mic works great and sounds clear the cable is long and slightly cumbersome as the mute volume panel is huge but overall it great headset would purchase again 
positive,this is nice little keyboard was purchasing for typing not gaming the keys are quiet seemed to be responsive but just didn care for how short it was while using my wrist rest had to angle my hands downward to reach the keys if you don use wrist rest than would recommend this keyboard 
neutral,nunca funciono
neutral,very nice
neutral,you get what you pay for noted have to click this mouse at least three times to get it to do what want on any button on it it is so frustrating and find myself wishing would have spent more for quality product which may now have to do anyway bc im just so unhappy with it it is so cheaply made plastic all around wonder how this can justify price of over jmo others seem to like it it just was not what am looking for used it as replacement to my imac mouse circa which finally died miss the magic mouse but not worth lol im going to have to find happy medium this mouse doesn get it at all only redeeming factor is it is rechargeable 
neutral,they look cool but are for child or person with small ears had to take them off and go back to my old ones after min
neutral,soft light smooth 
positive,i absolutely love these headphones the mic quality is amazing the sound quality is also amazing 
neutral,i liked the mic
positive,everything about this speaker is awesome 
neutral,i got the usb receiver but no mouse in the box

positive,recharges easy to use use it as my travel mouse would recommend it 
positive,the rugrat loves it 
neutral,stoped working since the first day doesn hold the charge and gets disconnected have to turn it on and off few times in order to connect it again to the computer don recommend to by this product 
positive,great purchase it so cute and easy to handle 
positive,i buy this to play games it is pretty for me 
negative,the mouse seems to work fine and looks nice but arrived very dirty the box being dirty can understand due to shipping but the mouse itself has lint few pieces of pet hair and the track scroll is dirty as if it been used lot it was not described as used but very much appears to be and upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box 
neutral,nothing
positive,great for gaming good noise cancellation awesome sound
positive,it good keyboard just wish could change the colors along with effect it has nice smooth key press oh and it what proof told 
neutral,does not hold charge have to recharge every three days approximately 
positive,works perfectly for what needed 
positive,superior sound quality well worth the price it rocks out the fire pit area in my backyard perfectly 
neutral,this is realy bad mouse iv used it for about weeks now and the sensor only picks up half of my movements the rgb is basally non existent and the feel of this mouse is realy crapy it seems can just break it with hand the batterie life is also terrible if it could not get worse then this the company actually buys the reviews by sending you money via paypal so don let the reviews make your decision
neutral,after few months of use obviously past the return window the scroll wheel on the mouse does not track any scrolls and spins almost like wheel on skateboard the led also stopped working if were to purchase again it would have to be considerably less with the frequency have to buy them 
neutral,broke within week
neutral,it fills the bill not too expensive works fine 
neutral,i read lot of the reviews before decide to buy this item so far have no regrets people complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on so when got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights if you think about it you are saving power when your not using it would recommend the product 
positive,i honestly liked everything overall sitting in my room listening to music thought it was super loud and loved it then when went outside you could barely hear it from short distance 
positive,it great
positive,bought this recently and very satisfied the audio is excellent my only issue is that the cord is very long but it can simply be wrapped great purchase 
negative,pretty but the quality is very poor it is rechargeable which was selling point but the quality isn there 
neutral,the keyboard is really nice but in the past weeks it doesn pick up charge anymore tried different chargers and it doesn work
positive,my niece loves this fur her college dorm 
neutral,i really like the feel and look of this mouse love the matte feel and the lights its also very quiet and not clicky wasn expecting that for the price the only issue have is that if you use it with laptop and remove the receiver often the receiver will come apart im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together with glue idk whenever take it out the usb drive and the black part separate and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens frustrating will say that it lasted couple months before that happened though if you use it with pc and never remove it itll last longer just wish could get replacement receiver don want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it got it in february and noticed that it glitches bit if its not on mouse pad or about to die which can be annoying but manageable the mouse charges very quickly 
neutral,very good come back if need to
positive,charge is perfect someone says the issues about the mono speaker but think it has higher quality than last generation cause two speakers are two close that the stereo cannot show in accurate steps so think it good idea to buy it by the way from the usa to korea only takes days the ships are so great 
positive,omg ve my speaker it better the cheapest speaker have in my backpack that cheap one whack and the jbl speaker is way beyond better ve it so much thanks amazon 
positive,i bought mouse for my daughter after she took my mouse while on vacation she loves it it has location to place the usb connector while not plugged in it has low profile which looks good with any computer plus it has usb to usb connect along with usb charging cable it also has solid color mode and changes colors mode good price for wireless mouse 
positive,great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic perfect for the bag that has just enough space when you re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly it sleep mode feature is nice adage increasing battery life and usability as far as gaming goes would recommend only lite casual games only not for gaming on the heavy side overall would buy again
neutral,light up can be used unless its plugged in so it can be used with the gaming controllers
positive,great speaker
positive,got for my year old fit his head perfectly 
positive,this little mouse works great for my needs it charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected would buy it again and recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse 
neutral,bought for laptop just poor performance of mouse

positive,product worked well until it didn after months won charge or power on 
positive,my son loves his headphones no complaints so far 
positive,i really liked this mouse but the battery runs out every few days wish the lights would automatically turn off after not being used for few minutes 
positive,love these first timer with this brand and am very happy with the sound quality and comfort of this headset cord is very long for my use on ps but prob very helpful for pc users
negative,haven even used it yet and won keys are all very loose and extremely cheap feeling but for the price it was kind of expected the most disappointing thing about the purchase is the way it was shipped ordered multiple products including few heavy tv mounts which were of course on top of the keyboard and my led lights ups was upset about the weight of the box and told me not to ship heavy items because they will be broken when they arrive if you must order this keyboard make sure you don order anything else at the same time 
positive,nice headset with very long cable works great solid product
positive,i have no complaints great sound full bass and aesthetically pleasing don plan on using the waterproof capabilities but definitely intend to use the power bank at some point 
positive,love it but the girls at work lost my charging cord any ideas where can get another cord other then that this mouse is awesome fast shipping just over all great
positive,i expected it to be lot louder had it outside for party and it wasn as loud as thought more for indoor for sure but still love the sound quality would still use it outside but just not for party

neutral,careful it not bluetooth had to order my daughter new one an kept this one for myself 
positive,i love it could be tad louder tho
positive,i love how vibrant the colors are but they are fixed they don transition between colors like other keyboard do but overall it is extremely simple to use and have had zero issues with this product 
neutral,looks good and has reasonable weight 
positive,i use this listening to music and broadcasts in my back yard and for podcasts from my phone like it so much am considering getting second one so that can enjoy true stereophonic sound 
positive,everything works great except one thing microphone cannot eliminate the noise from my surrounding when play apex legend with my brother he is always ranting me about the sound of pedestal fan like beeping sound that he can hear from my microphone when turn on the pedestal fan hope this review helps everything works great except for poor noise reduction of microphone 
neutral,the cord is stupid it like its backwards only way to use the lights is plug the cord in and the cord for the lighst is literally foot long that means you are foot in front of the tv when you play game ridiculous
positive,great product for the price and for year old very durable 
positive,easy to use has great sound quality and battery life the blue tooth is also easy to connect and use 
negative,bought this in june it dead plus when in wireless mode frequently multiple times per day the mouse drops connection cheap product would rather have working product

negative,it was working well until it just stopped working after months it won charge and turn on anymore pretty much useless now not well made and it waste of money if you re looking for reliable and and an item that will last long do not get this one coz you will be disappointed tried my luck and didn listen to the reviews read now am so disappointed could have spend more to most reliable and long lasting one 
neutral,i bought it in april and by august it would no longer charge 
neutral,got mouse for my son the light look cool and it was comfortable no complaints until the trackball quit working after about days contacted the company they communicated well and replaced it very quickly about week later the same thing happened again great communication and no issues with refund so good communication but not the best mouse 
positive,great stereo easy to bring anywhere and waterproof
positive,let face it it just mouse but kinda fun to have the colors since my keyboard is colored too 
positive,love this mouse just what was looking for
neutral,does not work
positive,we have the jbl flip and the charge that are able to sync together and provide coverage over the whole apartment so that we can listen to the same thing in the kitchen in the study in the living room in the bathroom or on the deck syncing is easy and intuitive volume control on the secondary speakers is controlled individually and you can pause them without interrupting anyone else listening or we can individually bluetooth to speaker and listen to different things or we use the speakers to amplify laptop sounds these are perfect simple to use and easy to understand we are so happy with them

neutral,not working since day one
neutral,efficient for its price
negative,of course didn expect high quality product for this low price but man the mouse didn even last week it dead charged it just one time and dead it could have worked at least half year just can believe that amazon let sellers like this run business on their platform 
positive,love the sound and the portability of this speaker would buy again 
positive,okay had these for days now and giving it out of five because the usb and the audio jack is too close together good thing had usb extender which plugged into my playstation and the controller in the led lights did not come on so took the extender off and plugged it in by itself the lights still did not come on despite that the sound quality is good but not as loud as would like but you do get great sound they are pretty good for gaming headset in music as well all in all say yes there were the price 
positive,there are two things like about this wireless mouse it rechargeable it took me while to get used to plugging it into my laptop when not using it but it easy through the usb cable they provide and the charge lasts and while there is an on off button it not so necessary as it goes into sleep mode when close my laptop all told am very satisfied with this mouse 
positive,the lights work but the keyboard is detected as mouse updated all driver software and their website support offers nothing the manual didn mention device manager isn leading to any solutions either give me my money back
positive,we are listening to our speaker for couple of weeks with one charge at least one hour per day the sound is great clear and may be loud if you want 
neutral,the mouse works but after less than week of use by my son the roller ball no longer works you can scroll with it the rest of it works for now but will probably not make it through the school year 
positive,very comfortable and good audio quality and my friends don complain about how sound anymore 
positive,we use it for our home pc works great would recommend
neutral,fast shipping and quality as described 
neutral,very good headset
positive,ps works great can hear word people say around me they have to yell for me to hear 
positive,the headphones are great they are very comfortable and has good sound quality for an affordable price don recommend using the headphones on laptops because it bent weird and messed up the wiring so bought another one and use the messed up one for the laptop other than that they are great 
positive,so far very pleased with this product it connected with my laptop automatically with no problems the slim line design slips into my laptop case outer pocket very nicely and there seems to be no issues with charging it from computer port 
positive,works great color just like into the picture the best thing is that it charge last for very long time don have to charge it everyday 
positive,for the price it not bad headset sound quality is good could use sound booster like button to increase the bass or treble that just my opinion after using multiple headsets that comes with those features overall they are right in the middle as far as sound and price is concerned also the cord is alil long like foot long wish it was shorter there is also two connects at the end it split with the headphone jack and usb at the end of the cord not really big thing but it does get in the way sometimes 
neutral,this product is slim and doesn fail easy click though and lights up charge lasts few day
neutral,this thing bumps to the the point my neighbor gets out of bed puts on their robe walks theft to my door and politely but sternly asks yo can you turn down the bieber 
positive,i use this headset for my ps and the microphone doesn work unfortunately my friends can barely hear my voice if not at all ve noticed the sound quality is very low as well even in high volume it doesn light up unless plugged into computer and when plugged into my laptop it doesn connect pray it ll get better soon 
neutral,it not the best nor the worst it just ok 
positive,i bought it because had low budget and needed one to game the mic quality is really good for this price and the headphone volume is good enough the noise cancellation is spot on as well make sure to buy because it is very good 
neutral,the aux on the jbl charge is poorly designed the speaker will turn off between songs or podcasts if there is delay extended silence or short period of low volume section causing parts of the song to missed for few seconds while it tries to turn back on this creates interruptions if you are trying to listen to yoga or meditative music or podcasts have two of them with the latest firmware and they both have this issue it appears many others have already commented on this issue apparently this was an intentional design by jbl to save power but it defeats the purpose of the aux port the bluetooth range and party range is mediocre you can leave the room with your phone or it will cut out 
neutral,the good has separate usb dongle that stores away and charges internally ie no need for battery the bad the mouse tracking is very erratic too fast too slow and could not find setting that suited me but what renders it unusable for me is the click latency have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work or end up dragging something don mean to some people may also find this mouse bit too small ymmv up to one taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display either just red or it switches colors wish you could turn it off though which unfortunately you can 
neutral,mouse not working properly 
neutral,battery doesn last long and sleep mode is annoying so tossed it without warning it will just quit on you going back to battery brand 
positive,love it 
neutral,cheaply made breaks after on use if you want to waste your money get it
neutral,warning it interferes with other usb devices plugged in to same computer 
negative,horrible just horrible
positive,i really think the sound is great the battery longevity is the best this is great product
positive,these headphones are amazing use them to record my videos 
positive,great product very easy to use and understand sleek design too 
neutral,broken key
positive,the mouse was surprisingly lightweight am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes huge difference it is super sensitive too was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue my old mouse required mouse pad the lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off the usb receiver was easily found underneath it was bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick it also comes with the usb adapter which you don see often but believe it would work with chromebook or maybe with usb charger it has everything need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is 
positive,great mouse like the colors and sleekness also rechargeable 
positive,love this mouse
positive,works well with macbook for gameplay love the changing light and ergonomic
positive,my son loves these they are definitely noise canceling because he can hear anything while gaming 
negative,this mouse was awful it worked for few minutes and then stopped working you have to turn it off and back on again for it to work for minute changed the battery twice do not purchase 
negative,this is the second time bought this mouse very cheaply made and the scroll wheels broke both times after about months of use do not recommend this item 
neutral,my year old didn care for them mic was to short sound quality was subpar
neutral,accent lights make it easy to find after days the scrolling wheel failed not good buy 
positive,awesome keyboard perfect for late night design work in the dark 
neutral,just couldn get the thing to work with both audio and mic at the same time
neutral,i like
positive,excellent my year old god daughter used it for school she said it was fantastic 
neutral,this keyboard is great to type on and is comfy to use the lack of colour modes make it seam less appealing
positive,i purchased this mouse for my laptop due to the ease of having mouse verse mouse pad this mouse is very easy to use rechargeable and the lights makes it easy to find 
positive,purchased for daughter and she didn like the ergonomics of it threw it in my work travel bag and have ended up using it works well and battery lasts while it also nice conversation piece in meetings 
positive,so cute great night light long battery no issues loveeeee it oh and it also pauses by itself when not in use which is cool
positive,very nice colors beautiful and quality
neutral,i can hear everything in my games now and also can hear my gf yelling at me to get off the game while have them on
positive,the reason why got it is so could do party chat on the ps since my earpods didn work at all with my ps tried it out and the audio works brilliantly and it easy to adjust and turn on and off the mic although did want it also for the light up function that it is and it was bit disappointing when needed to also plug it into usb port so the lights would turn on just glad that have converter for my macbook so could plug it to my laptop as well as my controller although wish could make it longer the spot where the two plug ins are so won have to sit so close to my laptop just to get both features that want 
positive, purchased this mouse for the style and cooler but after using it it was better than expected it is silent which prefer when using in class and the led light features makes it look even cooler 
positive,one of the best things you can buy for 
positive, it just came in the keyboard is exactly what they said it pretty quiet led feature well packaged shout out to amazon driver for delivering my package safely recommend this product to everyone 
positive,i didn buy this to game but to use with my macbook that is connected to my multiple screens liked it of the lit up keys find them to be hard to push and not comfortable guess could just be used to my mac keyboard and just being too hard on how the keyboard is supposed to function would like for it to stay lit up all the time while it breathes lights up as if it were breathing guess can understand why it doesn like it and would recommend it though it is relatively plug and play even on my mac works lot better for sure on windows systems for all the other functions of the keys 
positive,hands down the best headphones ve ever used can beat the incredible price either run don walk to get yours now 
positive,i ve been using logitech marble mice for years maybe over decade just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips but it weakness is that the marble mouse scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks legit scroll wheel that is probably the sole reason bought this led wireless mouse the led mouse seems to function well it has sleep mode that easily wakes up and had pretty color light around it don use it for general mousing but for scrolling once get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk in my lap wherever it makes up for what don have with my marble mouse the price was right and think if it what paid for it it good cheap addition 
positive,great
neutral,after month it started to double type and miss keystrokes 
positive,it really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in way the batter also seems to last quite few days if you turn it off when it not in use it also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle the silent clicking is what really gets me 
positive,i bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag this fits the bill this mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites using office applications like word excel and powerpoint etci would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes and that is not what it is meant for anyway if you want mouse that works for web browsing office work on the go looks nice and is slim and compact get this device 
positive,my kid says they re pretty good microphone is great noise canceling could be better but overall really good headphones for the price 
positive,great good for gaming 
negative,piece of junk already broken irritated
positive,this is great economical mouse love the colored led lights and works perfectly great deal 
neutral, mouse stopped working had it worked for couple of days 
positive,this works like normal mouse and everything however the light that in the mouse is so bright it shines through the white on my mouse it not good aesthetically however if you want mouse that does mouse things this one fine 
neutral,the usb charging port was bent had to bend back before could even plug it in to use amazon needs to start labeling the country of origin don want to support country that suppresses its people destroyed democracy in hong kong made in china junk 
neutral,i used it for about six weeks and it stopped working
negative,horrible product stopped working day we returned this microphone twice and both stopped working nd one stopped working within month the rd time we tried returning they wouldn process the refund amazon is turning into wish my little boy was so disappointed as was miss the old amazon 
neutral,it taken me while to remember to turn it on after it sits awhile 
positive,it perfect and fast shipping
negative,i used this mouse once after this use it died so was going to charge it up figuring didn give it enough time to charge tried different times and it wouldn charge at all so decided to just go back to my old mouse tried to remove the usb and the metal part broke off and stayed inside my laptop so had to remove it and there was no fixing it so disappointed in the quality of this mouse 
positive,this thing almost caught fire melted port and cable now could have got dud get it but this is unacceptable period even contacted there customer support and what joke they did not take it serious at all pretended to transfer me to another dept and hung up on me please buy something else 
neutral,sad that you can get anything from china that works for more than month these days it getting to be ridiculous at this point bought these for my kid and like clockwork they broke precisely after the day warranty was up no sound output at all maybe just have horrible luck but it seems like if it says made in china on it and you use it with any type of regularity it gonna take dump prematurely these things aren work not to mention that it huge ordeal if you want the lights to work and you re playing on console avoid these turds at all cost ve heard that the company is impossible to get ahold of anyways so not going to waste my time 
positive,i like the movement of the mouse have bought two of them because of price and needed both for two of my computers great wireless mouse with added bonus of color led which change
positive,inexpensive love the changing of colored lights
positive,love it
neutral,excelent product
positive,i love that this model still has the aux port with all the great things of the newer models 
neutral,great sound quality but the mic is not rotatable so no one can hear me while in game 
positive,the speaker connected to my phone right away however it was very difficult to connect it to alexa and it didn work very smoothly had to go into the app to reconnect every time wanted to use it the main problem however is that it wouldn connect at all to the jbl app contacted customer service and they suggested resetting the speaker and explained how to do this followed the directions and the speaker behaved exactly as they said it would and then turned off success except not so much now the speaker won turn on at all hoping this is just defective device and when return it and receive my new one it will work much better if so will rate it again in more positive light added note once again was able to contact jbl customer service and they got the device working again it works perfectly except it still won connect to the jbl app after reading reviews of the app this is clearly failure of the app not the speaker love the speaker gave instead of only because of the problem with the jbl app 
neutral,not practical for me fir everyday use
positive,perfect for listening anywhere portability great sound and plenty of volume nice upgrade from original flip and charge enjoyed immensely for last few years 
negative, the wireless mouse was great in the beginning weeks later it wouldn keep charge when it did charge it would only work if it was hooked up to the charger on my laptop meaning still couldn use it then would unplug it and lights started going crazy so would turn the switch off and on to try and use it epic fail waste of my hard working money then they only give you certain amount of time to return so basically it total loss 
positive,it works fine however sometimes it does not response when you move your hand also do not recognize when the dpi is activated or not also when you click the bottom it does not response so you have to press it more than one time for it works also it is felt very plastic 
negative,my fiance barely used the keyboard shes controller player on rocket league and probably had less than keystrokes day keyboard is dead after month and week
positive,i purchased two different keyboards and after trying both this one won hands down it is so comfortable to use and stunning to look at use it for every day use and it perfect highly recommend it every time sit down to use my computer when hit that space bar smile it really cool 
positive,this mouse is great it connected easily to my windows laptop as well as to my girlfriend imac love that the clicking is quiet think will get another one so we can each have one the lights are cool but am glad there is switch to shut them off that is actually great feature 
negative,nobody order this piece of crap its trash cant even fortnite cause its too freaking twitchy
positive,this product is very cheaply made purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse however the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on web page easily breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one buyer beware take it from father who has went through of them 
positive,the mic is really great and has good sound quality was amazed that it was as good as it is for the price you pay for it but the only downside to it is the mic doesn have the clearest of sound and you kinda sound like you re in box but would recommend it to anyone who looking for cheap mic with great sound quality 
neutral,my son bought this for gaming but they wee damaged did not work he unfortunately told me after the return window was closed 
positive,i love that it lights up but have ps so to have it light up and plugged into my controller kind have to choose which want to use over all it nice looking headset 
positive,love everything about it recommend it 
positive,sounds great
positive,nice gamine headset for good price
positive,so good can play my video games
neutral,ordered in may and key stopped working at the end of july 
positive,works as expected like the colors they puts little sunshine in my work day sleep mode is too quick for me but it wakes up quickly after good shake 
neutral,i am updating my review of this headset received an updated gaming headset from the vendor the issues that had had have been corrected with the new headset am extremely pleased with my new product the company has done an outstanding job to solve my initial issue please ignore my previous review that is below one of the issues is that the headphones were sized for young kid and expanding them did not help that much the sound quality was fine but noise cancellation was not adequate 
neutral,worth it 
positive,well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the wireless section bought cause of how cool it looks also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juiced up so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die have not had to many times it died on me but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up other than that item is perfect 
neutral,i have two of them both speakers are popping they lasted little over year each will not purchase again 
negative,unfortunately our product broke but bengoo reached out to us and was willing to issue us full refund for our troubles 
neutral,using the type port as its plug in method does not work while plugged in my computer does not detect or accept the plug in if this is your main use in mind do not use it 
positive,simply put it is great mouse for what it worth however had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the usb adapter that comes with the product have ports the manual grammar is terrible btw tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them none of them worked which was bummer then tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away the adapter they provide you is just useless so if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook you should get separate adapter once connected it though it seemed to work perfectly smooth tracking silent clicks and the rgb lighting is beautiful just got it today so hopefully it will keep working the way they claim it should work 
positive,big bang for your buck durable waterproof and great battery life
positive,for my son gaming and it perfect
positive,exactly what needed and was looking for in game game set sound quality is amazing and easy to use 
negative,i was so excited this mouse looks beautiful but it was one of the most frustrating devices have ever used when clicking to wake it up it would click on whatever may be on the screen at the moment including email or im drafts that have not yet been reviewed or perhaps written in anger and did not mean to send lol when you wanted to click on something you had to click several times overall frustrating very good return process no questions asked and quick refund that why stars 
positive,my son loves his new gaming keyboard and thinks everything about it is great noticed that the product was reasonably priced and arrived promptly my son recommends this to everyone who likes gaming 
neutral,such boom for the buck bought one then after hearing it ordered second 
neutral,it only worked one day never would connect after that 
neutral,no good
positive,everything works great except for the mic the mic wont transmit at all the customer service however contacted me shortly and refunded me for my purchase as well as apologized know that sometimes issues happen and its the way that companies fix things that make big difference they did right by me and salute themfor that will definately do business with them again 
positive,i bought like new speaker but before made my purchase contacted the seller and basically asked why the product was classified as like new their response item is inspected and functional there day return period took chance the only reason didn give star rating is because my speaker arrived very poorly packed consider myself lucky the speaker is of such superior quality durability because delivery people don make habit of handling packages carefully and the protection provided amounted to some shredded foam from an original box thrown in regular shipping box with the packing bubble wrap everything had shifted in shipping there was no effort to secure the bits of packing material to protect the unit and it arrived with no user manual or operating instructions of any kind had to go on youtube for tutorial and to jbl site for manual download so stars for the product itself actually give the shipper stars but don want the overall rating to reflect poorly on the product itself jbl is the truth 
neutral,just received this yesterday and plugged it in today have left it on the charger for longer than hours because every time it says it is charged can not use it longer than min before it goes dead like the look and feel of it but did not buy it to used plugged in very disappointed and will have to buy something different the box got thrown away so guess it can not be returned at this point will give it one more day to try before choosing something different like to hope that just got lemon 
neutral,product was easy to set up however only lasted month charging port broke after weeks and was not able to get it to charge few weeks after that 
neutral,i waited while to leave review tought it would last but it didn it was really smooth and long lasting battery little did know while using it it would become apart internally the scrollwheel broke usually fix my electronics easily sometimes things just need little adjustment but this part broke and with no fixing maybe some of you are lucky and doesn break easily mine did and not even weeks of using it 
positive,i love this mouse 
positive,very nice headphones kids use them for gaming as well as headphones for their ipads great sound quality 
positive,great product

positive,i liked the feel and positive sensitivity of the keys unfortunately it just wasn bright enough for me to see the lettering 
positive,i love the look the colors and it fits my hand grip perfectly awesome device 
neutral,i used two charge speakers in my workshop wish jbl could make it so both speakers will turn off and on when one turns bluetooth back on from the same device it appears the jbl speaker does not remember after being turned off or disconnected that it was paired with another jbl device 
positive,it slim and doesn make noise the colors are great wasn expecting much but this mouse really surpassed what thought was going to get to install is super easy the usb is small so it doesn get in the way the mouse is super slim and the scroll works great 
positive,i love this mouse not only is silent mouse but it is light and also changes colors on the side so far have received compliments from my coworkers they said it fancy mouse 
positive,this is great back up set for when your good headset breaks the more you use this one the worse it gets at first it sounded great the glowed very bright but after few months there was lot of feed back in the mic and the surround sound didn work at all made gaming hard without being able to hear call outs 
positive,cute and comfortable design but quit working after month save your money

positive,great price great sound can hear everything on xbox the headache part is the mic stops working st stop they replaced them now the replacement doing the same thing anyone else has this problem 
positive,work great specially cause have big head so definitely recommend conforms fits and doesn irritate 
neutral,if you had that ve never ending need to have wireless mouse that has led colors on it that needs to be constantly plugged in for it to work then this is for you the charge on it will last approximately hours before it dead if you turn off the pretty lights then maybe it will last hours really not functional wireless mouse don buy it

neutral,it looks good feels good but just works poorly did not track smoothly at all and more times than not trying to get the pointer to stop having little seizure on the screen tried with and without pad under it 
positive,i was looking to buy portable mouse for travel and was going to buy regular battery one but saw this pop up as an option really like the mint green color it affordable easy to use connects fast and very low profile the clicker is quiet too scroller works great as well charged it up connected via usb to my dock station and it was ready to go love it 
neutral,quiet click holds charge forever colors are nice touch
negative,it broke the mouse is unresponsive the wheel is isolated it is inconvenient having to charge the mouse every few uses through cable it 
neutral,cant believe the quality for the price highly recommend this to anyone building either new office set up or gaming set up 
positive,i like the product its not heavey it doesnt make my ear hurt at all the sound is nice good price for it
positive,i used for gaming great headset for the price 
neutral,the usb charging port was bent had to bend back before could even plug it in to use amazon needs to start labeling the country of origin don want to support country that suppresses its people destroyed democracy in hong kong made in china junk 
positive,my boyfriend loved them
neutral,the keyboard lights up beautifully it just never works with the computer complete waste of money

positive,this speaker is great wonderful sound easy connectivity to bluetooth mostly long lasting battery life 
positive,perfect size for small hands

positive,i have it for my personal computer and it has worked out great
neutral,i had my mouse for about week and after using it maybe times it completely stopped moving around only things that works on it is the buttons and the wheel
neutral,regardless of where you plan to use this product home school or work you can go wrong with this product it quality product at great price ve had mine less than week now and just ordered another one add little light in your life 
positive,units has incredible battery life great sound and water proof use it every time go to the pool beach or outdoors 
positive,great product
neutral,noise cancellation sucks
positive,perfect
positive,i love the color rose gold and it works great on variety of surfaces just wish it would alert me when the battery is low so can charge it before need it for work 
neutral,purchased two works as described you can beat this price highly recommend 
positive,it is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud rgb is decent for the price but wish it was brighter overall its decent
positive,if you re touch typist expect to be slowed down and make lot of mistakes because the enter key is much further to the right than any other keyboard ve ever used because of this this keyboard is very uncomfortable to use the keys resist bit but bounce back slowly it very easy for fast typist to get letters out of order because they keyboard just isn responsive enough don see how anyone would accept this as gaming keyboard 
positive,it is amazing it sounds great
negative,i loved this keyboard for the months it worked then all of sudden the keys either lagged or didn register the click at all then came the connectivity issues it would not work at all even though the usb was plugged in and it was charged would have to troubleshoot for an hour and only sometimes it would work again other times just gave up now after having it for months decided to see if could get it to work again after storing it for about month it does not even register that it is charging so she dead dead very upset with this product 
positive,this product was an overall good purchase the quality was good and it didn feel cheap its sturdy with good cable good for the low price 
positive,great product good starting set for small children who are prone to destroying things often the upside is they are quite affordable too so it doesnt take much to replace them when the inevitable breaking happens thanks so much for delivering what was advertise and at such speedy rate 
negative,do not use this keyboard if you are programmer and need the backslash key often typically this key is to the right of the close bracket key instead its row lower this requires you majorly change how you code you can even remap the key to something else simply because theres no other key to remap it to 
neutral,can change the color only stays on red
positive,some might like long cord but this is bit long wish the usb port was disconnected and could be an attachment the headphones themselves are great the look is beautiful the lights are nice touch the microphone is bit stiff moving up and down but that fine 
neutral,i don write reviews very often but will make an exception for this piece of junk were you wanting wireless keyboard because this is not wireless it requires usb cable for power oh yes indeedy and so now you are using not one but two of your usb ports for this bs what waste of time
positive,i think this mouse is great love the led colors changing it goes to sleep after little while to save battery life it very simple to charge if it ever needs it my only thing about it and it not even negative about the device is that my hands are very big so this seems little tinier than like still though got no complaints about it 
neutral,light and the clicks are very quiet it durable especially like the fact it light up and change colors
neutral,i love this mouse but have only had for couple months and it completely stopped working yesterday 
positive,bought for gaming took great care of them ans out them up everyday once he was finished days after the day return window closed they no longer work

neutral,do not buy this it doesnt connect or show up on my laptop to pair it dont suggest anyone buy this item
positive,i needed mouse that was reliable and easy to use this was perfect wireless and just plug in and use love the different colors don think twice get this mouse asap 
neutral,i thought would give these try but the mic is difficult because have to yell for it to pick up my voice or have to mute then unmute for mic to work because randomly it stops then it so tight on my head got headache in min it was so uncomfortable to wear my cheap turtle beach ones are better just don recommend 
neutral,this keyboard has range of about inches and minutes of game time it is not responsive and most likely the chat will have moved on by the time the keyboard decides to start inputting what you are typing had it for less than week 
negative,i charged the keyboard overnight it lights up but when plug it in to dell computer the keystrokes don register with the computer it doesn work very disappointed because wanted to use it while it dark in the morn or night emailed klimtech and no response after days 
positive,very good reliable mouse was not disappointed 
neutral,you get what you paid for lol it worked great at first but the usb receiver stopped working after months so the mouse couldn connect to mac at all tragic
positive,my nephew got pair of these last christmas and loved them so bought him pair to have at home too 
negative,this is the worst wireless mouse ve ever had the displeasure of using bought it thinking how bad can it really be it just needs to connect to my laptop well if this could be negative star rating would do it if you stop moving the mouse for seconds or more you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn respond to your movements it doesn have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use it is garbage 
neutral,the cord going into for charging doesn fit exactly right seems cheaply made wouldn buy this brand again 
positive,loved the change of lights and the fell under my hand great mouse

positive,i really love this little mouse as it is easy to use and can put it in safe mode so don have to keep recharging it and saving on having to buy batteries my laptop is used primarily for embroidery files so don use it for gaming and can address that 
positive,i love this mouse it is easy to use and it is very pretty the lights on it just make it that much more cool great product 
positive,i like this mouse works very good the dpi button do it work is very silent and you can turn off the color light very recommended 
positive,i bought this keyboard so could see the keys as write in the evening and at night this lightweight soft keys keyboard has great backlighting with multiple colors that flash the light gently in the background as you type when the keys are not in use the backlighting turns black off therefore sparing the user the time it would need to charge it there is also an on off button that is optional as well am able to use this keyboard swiftly and quietly with no problem

neutral,enjoy using 
positive,i bought this to replace logitech wireless keyboard used to control my htpc from the couch about feet away the logitech was not lighted and the signal was not very good from that distance this klim keyboard has completely reliable wireless connection and hasn missed keystroke yet and love being able to see the lighted keys at night the battery is pretty decent as well lasting around days before need to charge it again with heavy use it comes with usb charge cable that you just plug into any usb charger or pc usb port to charge the built in battery the only slight negative is the layout is iso vs ansi and takes bit to get used to overall highly recommend this keyboard

positive,i am year old woman with small head have hard time even finding retail hats that fit me so have horrible time finding any kind of headphones that fit and or are not painful only just got these and on the smallest setting they mostly fit could honestly have them just little smaller and be perfect but at least these are not squeezing my head like vice as so many do the ear pieces go all the way around my ears so they are also not squeezing my ears which is painful think they will be ok for long periods of use because they do not hurt the sound quality seems fine hearing surround sound in my game as type this my voice comes out clear as does those am chatting with it easy to mute myself as well and change the volume right from the headset over all think these are really good quality and great price the lights are pretty although doubt will bother using them since do not stream and only have two usb ports on my laptop anyway 
positive,not sure about the battery life as just got it and haven used it for any length of time the seller however was efficient and it seems like decent value at the price point

neutral,i ve had this less than year it been wonderful but is starting to get skippy glitchy to where it unusable it shame it nice colorful quiet mouse but evidently not made very well 
positive,this mouse works as advertised the changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for new mouse on amazon don really like the slim feel to it feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time also was looking for specifically usb mouse and to make this one work with usb you have to use the included adapter which ends up sticking out quite ways on the edge of your computer this is clearly stated in the advertisement just didn pay enough attention when bought the mouse

neutral,does not work
neutral,broke did not work
neutral,for listening to music
positive,best jbl speaker very good sound color are greats many hours of baterry charge 
neutral,was nice until it stopped working after only few weeks wouldn buy this again not worth the money 
neutral,very cheap for the price received the item and did not work some of the keys didnt work tired to return this item to amazon but it is non returnable item even if it is broken now am out dollars beware stay away from this product
positive,very happy and true to its description 
positive,my other wireless mouse stopped working for some reason and required batteries so had to get another one love that it is rechargable and has the lights the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side thats cool also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny didnt know before buying but it has sleep mode so thats great for if forget to turn it off have to double check the manual but there are switches and dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into usb port to connect to your device honestly like it only other thing is im not sure how know when its dying again may be in the manual 
neutral,this mouse is great and if it didn do this one annoying thing would give it stars it emits really high pitched squeal when you don use mousepad it coincides with the led light color change if you pick it up and set it down it makes really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in quiet environment which do it similar to smoke alarm if it were far away get one that doesn have the lights that should help 
neutral,i don like that need to replug it in my laptop to get it to work every time use it
neutral,did not work well for me only worked when it felt like it very inconsistent 
negative,i bought this because of the lights and it looked cool but it does not have battery it needs to be plugged in to charge unless you babysit it by always turning it off when you are done using it the charge dies after days and then you have dead mouse or one that is now wired as it charges too high maintenance for mouse 
negative,one drop to the floor it broke 
positive,excellent quality great sound and lightweight
negative,reasonably priced and beautiful chroma lighting effects on keyboard the keyboard is indeed silent but somehow the lack of tactile feedback sometimes makes one wonder if the keys had been depressed correctly 
positive,so when reading the reviews seen bunch of bad ones that were posted recently and it honestly scared me still got them anyways because don mind for how long they last but the mic is pretty good for now take care of my stuff so ll make this mic last for the time need it for but it from me so far 
positive,i had wireless keyboard before purchased this one it lagged while typed and sometimes would have to sit for half minute before could start again love this keyboard it does everything need it to do love fact can charge it and never needs batteries to be replaced 
neutral,the mouse started off great even got two one for me and one for my son they both failed about the same time it charges for hours and then when switch it on it has double red blink and does not react same thing when plugged in 
positive,great quality for the price works awesome with call of duty would recommend 
positive,the only adjustment personally needed to make was learning to work the sleep mode and click the button to wake it back up other than that love this mouse for work the lights on it still work almost months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into standard micro usb cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about days usually just end the evening plugging in to micro usb port and am always good to go grat buy and will replace with the same when the time comes 
positive,it great headset great noise canceling
neutral,this keyboard has short battery life and doesn give any sort of indication that the battery is low till it stops working then when you charge it it doesn let you know when its done it also doesn seem to like any alt or windows key related shortcuts from the left side only the right
positive,i ve had this mouse since august and don like writing reviews until ve had the item for bit this mouse worked great and love how quiet it is however about weeks ago it started giving me trouble find myself tapping it with medium force on the desk in order for the cursor to move charge it completely and even completely charged it gives me these issues 
neutral,the mouse only works if directly next to the usb port it is plugged into so it is useless if using it foot below on keyboard tray the instructions are not in english to try and troubleshoot 
neutral,mic cut out periodically and it serves the bare minimum but it stopped working after month of use
neutral,i am told people can barely hear me when im not talking loud its probably the distance the mic is from my face bc its worse when the mic isn all the way down also dont use the lights on this hook it into my game controller which is way too far from any computers to be able to plug the usb in at the same time which powers the lights if ur audio plug is right next to usb plug there shouldn be much issue this does not have the feature that turns the mic off when the bar containing the mic is up over all got this on primeday and its my st headset ive used for gaming its functional
neutral,charged all night and only last few minutes this mouse has pretty design but it too thin to hold just asked for refund but not replaced 
positive,battery holds for several days after one charge probably almost two weeks or more lighting is beautiful and can be adjusted very responsive 
negative,horrible keyboard not wireless wired for light to work then it turns off in seconds worst keyboard have ever bought do not like thing about it
neutral,look good
positive,not bad rechargeable and portable highly recommend
positive,brought this for my son and he loves it he takes it everywhere we go 
positive,this headset is extremely good headset has comfort in the ear pieces it glows and that just makes them cooler lol they have great sound come with great microphone literally have no complaints about the headset ended up returning them because needed something smaller and more dainty for my work from home job being that am required to wear headset each working day for plus hours day 
positive, love the adaptability for inputs outputs
positive,great audio just breaks wayy too easy have to buy pair like once month time to find different better brand 
positive,worked great for about months stays charged for long time and like being able to use the port in my laptop however now the scroll button moves erratic scrolling down the page and the page jumps up go up and it jumps down 
positive,the transmitter isn that strong the mouse starts to jump and delays so much if it too far from it ended up going back to my original one until find new one again 
negative,i was very disappointed when the mouse stopped responding after few weeks of using it
neutral,good
positive,got these for my husband for gaming and he loves them tried them on and the sound quality is lot better than had expected for the price great quality for great price 
neutral,decent quality for the price
positive,bought this led wireless mouse july and received it couple of day later and really loved it well now it aug and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly don even use it with the fancy light changes on tried charging it couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should noticed that if left still for few minutes it would sometimes function well but only for few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor if at all the little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold charge oh have also tried using it while connected to the charge port but it does the same would have given it star rating if it continued working properly as really like it however since the sudden misfunction cannot give it more than stars and must say that would not recommend this mouse anymore 
positive,i love having this speaker good quality
neutral,great sound no issues here ve had them for about two months and use them everyday 
positive,this mouse works very well and has very long battery life very happy with this purchase 
positive,grabbed this for my laptop so don have to mess with the trackpad for work after days of use it no longer holds charge not the fault of the charge port as switched it to different one to be sure the price is too good to be true 
neutral,my first internal battery mouse liked the ergonomics but the charging was more frequent than would have liked the mouse was thrown in landfill mere months old because the wheel broke mouse not really going to miss you 
negative,the different colored lights stopped working after week and it only had red light after two months the mouse stopped working entirely sucks because it too late to return it
positive,amazing product able to take it where ever and connect when needed nice and small fits any where need for on the go 
positive,i ve had this wireless keyboard for almost month this is my first one because my brother was the one that recommended this to me had get used to the backlit lights not being on all the time but overall this is an excellent wireless keyboard and have not had an issue with it it came undamaged and it arrived quick and the customer service at klim has excellent customer service 
positive,it very good had for about months and has not had problem the volume and sound allow for me to hear enemy foot steps the sound nob is good addition so if you are in game you can change the volume without going in and out of the game menu 
positive,for the money this mouse is great value needed new mouse as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to miss wanted something fairly inexpensive wireless and rechargeable am tired of having to switch out batteries this mouse fit all those perfectly my first month impression is it excellent after the initial charge it still going strong with maybe an hour day usage after weeks it goes to sleep after period of inactivity which helps to conserve the battery my only gripe would be the slim profile think prefer little more bulk in my palm my only contact with the mouse when navigating is with my fingers no palm contact this does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as slim profile design all in am glad purchased this mouse if this company develops full contoured model would surely upgrade 
positive,good entry level keyboard it does the job wish light stay on and doesn turn off when not touching it for long time great add on to my other klim items 
neutral,terrible product charge lasts only couple of hours

positive,i bought this for my daughter and she loves it the colors are great which is what she loves most it also very lightweight simple to use and reasonably priced like that you can charge it instead of having to change batteries the most important thing for me is durability she is child and is still kind of rough with her electronics but so far it is holding up

positive,this mouse is fun it works well keeps it charge and is nice to watch 
positive,works great for home office and gaming
positive,great speaker feel like it was worth the money
neutral,like others have reported the mouse curser jumps around and blinks after short min period of use making it difficult to control and sometimes nonresponsive you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision charged it over the weekend thinking the battery was not fully charged but the same results this morning have requested refund and will be purchasing something that works

positive, love the fact that this thing is quiet as mouse lol hate the clicking sound on other mouses the other thing love is that it rechargeable no batteries the only con could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse that the only reason why gave it stars 
neutral,this is exactly what needed my favorite features are the quite clicks and the led lights

neutral,broke inside my laptop had to remove it with tweezers this was christmas gift it didn last days 
negative,the scroller broke within week and the material looked greasy and worn after about week of very limited use 
positive,it pretty mouse just some notes plastic bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic it fine just an aesthetic thing mouse wheel bit noisy now after some use squeeks and screetches some when scrolling battery life is fine glad can use it when charging sensitivity is off cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out thought this was battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes overall it fine but shouldve just bought something bit sturdier even if it was pricier gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth 
neutral,only holds charge for minutes 
neutral,great sound for price no noise canceling at all besides foam around ears also need extra usb plug for lights feel it unnecessary 
positive,great keyboard for the price really like the feel of the keys not used to the enter key yet having notch out where the key is but not big deal also wish it had dedicated volume keys as well as opposed to pressing the fn key first 
neutral,wish the battery lasted longer seem to have to recharge it every month vs rechargeable batteries last me months before need to recharge otherwise nice ergonomic shape and low enough to not affect the wrist the optical sensor is not so great especially when battery is low 
positive,it works great for about month
neutral,product will not charge tried multiple outlets boxes cords product turns on for seconds has red light then shuts off junk 
neutral,i was enjoying these headphones although they had some odd features like the dual cable that is excessively long the sound quality was pretty great for the price while it lasted but they made odd cracks and pops from time to time maybe from whatever issue caused them to stop working either way am not impressed and even if were to get another pair of headphones from this brand would not try anymore at this price point

positive,sharp looking headset with great sound very comfortable to wear 
positive,the mouse is really quiet no clicking sound which liked comfortable for the hand does not hold charge very long and nothing worse than not responding during middle of the work day had tried to different brands the other was one that had bluetooth feature so could use it on my tablet that held charge all week and will be getting another one of those

positive,smooth mouse moves nice great fit luv the lights nice bonus

neutral,not well made very light and flimsy returned it 
neutral,love this mouse overall beautiful lights fits well in hand responsive but wheel broke after less than one month of regular use for design work very sad this is the second mouse ve bought first lasted months same issue because like it so much unfortunately will be looking for something different for my next mouse 
neutral,this is probably my second review in life because hate leaving them but very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after month of use don even use it every day hell don even use it every other day so this definite came as shock of course the return window is closed which go figure when you sell cheap mouse and the seller isn easily accessible like to think out of good character and business that would be able to replace this mouse as love the color and the lights on it but what the point if it no longer serves its purpose 
positive,we got this for my son birthday and it has been great speaker he uses it with his friends all the time on the back of his truck and we have used several times around the pool the speaker is plenty loud enough to hear over the equipment and it has great bass response for such small package the battery seems to stay charged forever and we have not had one single issue with bluetooth connectivity also like the fact that you compare this with other speakers to have true surroundsound when you re out with your buddies or at party 
neutral,good for gaming as advertised
positive,my son uses it at school he is years old when asked him this he said it good better than my other one that it

positive,with the price was skeptical but this mouse really does work well as soon as plugged in the usb it took all of second before could start using it the clicks are smooth and quiet and it feels great ergonomically the lights also look really good highly recommend it 
neutral,just garbage do not waste your money it is not working after couple of weeks 
positive,ill start with cons unresponsive sometimes doesnt tell if the battery is low there is no indicator so if youre playing intensely and stops all of sudden it will pissed off little keyboard sound is like so and so its not mechanical it will make sound depends how heavy you type you can customize the rgb its fixed pros keyboard lights wont bother you if you play while the lights are off keyboard lights has modes which is cool steady pulse and no lights you can also adjust the light from low to high rechargable and has its own usb type cable and has its own bluetooth connector to pc when charged it lasts quite long if you play casually it can go up to to days without charging it goes on sleep mode if not in use lightweight always put this on my lap since my pc is connected to my tv and always play from my bed budget friendly its good keyboard if youre not ready for razer and corsair type of peripherals and looking for budget friendly one then give this keyboard try update am returning the keyboard as it is faulty the and quotation mark got switched its becoming more and more unresponsive got this days ago and its not doing so well update on battery it lasts days max if used casually am changing my review to star and dont recommend this now better look for something else or really invest to good brand gaming keyboard instead its waste of time and money for just little feature

positive,i bought this keyboard about months ago and have used it daily for gaming for the most part it awesome it lightweight easy to use the rbg is nice and clear and perfect for night time gaming ve seen some reviews saying the power button is cheap and feels likely to break that is not the cause the power button isn flimsy in the slightest and doesn feel cheap also saw some say there no volume control on the keyboard there is keys for it are on the top left side my only complaint with this keyboard has been the noise lot of people including kilm claim it is silent have not found the that the case it an angry typing sounding keyboard and often have to make sure my mic is muted before using it to save complaints overall it great keyboard especially if you re on budget have no doubts that it will last long time and be worth every penny

positive,the product arrived in an undamaged box with the details of the keyboard on the back upon opening the box there was the keyboard small envelope and user manual in several languages the keyboard had the wireless connector in the back and power switch to turn it on inside the envelope was note on how the shipping was processed along with branded stickers the keys on the keyboard all work very well and do make nice clicking noise overall am very happy with this product and would be happy to get other products from the same brand

neutral,broken and flimsy on arrival
positive,using this for gaming and music and stuff lights work and the mic remote works quality is ok quality could be better but its cheap you know how it is some things are good other things are cheap some things are both good and cheap but then they re broken so you know how it is life can be that way for many folks out here in america 
neutral,this stopped working after month even after charging it won turn on 
neutral,this is realy bad mouse iv used it for about weeks now and the sensor only picks up half of my movements the rgb is basally non existent and the feel of this mouse is realy crapy it seems can just break it with hand the batterie life is also terrible if it could not get worse then this the company actually buys the reviews by sending you money via paypal so don let the reviews make your decision

neutral,it had worked very well for me for about years and it very aesthetic 
positive,super comfy and cool but get disconnected easily 
positive,not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife she gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too 
neutral,totally stopped working after months only day refund policy 
positive,great sound for great price amazing 
positive,my son loves it 
neutral,right out of the box this thing has some weight to it feed very sturdy sound gets loud with really good low end bass 
neutral,have no problems works just fine 
positive,recently purchased this mouse the look of the lights is cool not fan of the sleep mode but did love the smooth feel of movement and the track wheel was perfect however after day and half went to charge it and it never came back on thought it needed to charge longer but no just stopped working 
neutral,i bought these headphones for use on xbox and they sisnt even work with sound was then shipped another pair not the same hunterspider gaming headset headphones for ps ps switch xbox one pc with microphone noise reduction surround sound led light blue these were given to me instead and the mic doesnt even work on these 
positive,this thing worked great the first time used it then wouldn work at all won charge won move the cursor total crap 
positive,this mouse is of great quality
positive,wow you really can go wrong with this mouse bought it for work since they still have the wired mouse but the traction is horrible with this replacement no wires no cables only to charge it the traction is great very responsive

positive,my son loves this headset he says the sound quality is great and loves the light up feature 
positive,this is great wireless keyboard and it really quiet which sure over time and use the loud clicking will return that what my other gaming keyboard did anyway it feels comfortable it works great and enjoying it so far just wish the keyboard itself was little bigger but that my fault for not checking the measurements 
positive,best ive ever had def 
positive,love it 
positive,very basic mouse rechargeable battery that lasts awhile great for just needing simple wireless option at good price 
positive,great quality headset sounds great and the lights look great
neutral,just got the item today everything works out great but the usb could not fit into the adapter neither could any other usb as seen in the picture they all try to go in sideways and thats why they wont fit so even though the product works just fine am unable to use it which is why its three star regardless if you have normal usb ports this product will work just fine 
neutral,worse sound than the charge 
positive,i love it
positive,i love this mouse and the best thing about it is my favorite color sleep mode is great thing and very colorful it must have 
neutral,not enough of curve to use comfortably performed it basic functions for the short time it was used 
positive,works great 
positive,not made for ps first off you need to plug in the usb connection into separate power source to get the lights to work the sound jack that plugs in to your ps controller is split with the usb but both cords are very short so you have to choose to play with the lights off if you want to use it with the ps controller comfortably if thats the case then whats the point of owning it this is made more for laptops than ps dont recommend if you are thinking of buying it for the ps 
neutral,first the roller broke then the left button the led lights are pretty cool though 
positive,this keyboard is simple and easy to use you can change the blink speed of the led lights or if you prefer to leave it on as well it has second sleep mode so pretty convient 
positive,this mouse is perfect addition to your laptop it is easy to set up very affordable and the ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue 
neutral,had to exchange first one after month replacement was fast and easy
positive,i was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling the mouse stopped scrolling you don realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works for the scroll to just stop literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will decided to hold on to it cause it just so cute and matches my laptop however soon after the sensor and clicker stopped working as well now forced to get new mouse

positive,love everything about it recommend it 
positive,works good and plug and play 
positive,this product was definitely worth the money it equipped with every function desirable for wireless mouse being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally the rgb lights were nice as well 
neutral,my son used this daily for years before it broke age he immediately bought another great quality for the price 
negative,it doesn move used for days and gave up really bad 
positive,really like this product left handed and ve been searching for something universal it light sleek and easy to transport the charge stayed longer than expected 
positive,i bought this for my laptop for school work and it exceeded my expectations the colors are amazing and not too distracting so easy to connect and use it also silent love it 
positive,ok the good small company like supporting that great packaging they have an insert that tells you about the team that designed the keyboard the construction is solid doesn feel like junk well made what could be better the brightness of the colors in the photo is not what you are going to see in the product you can see the colors but it not very bright this is simply light behind the keys but considering it connected to your computer it should be brighter because it has continuous power source what is jeez not good the key placement it off understand that anytime you get new keyboard that your fingers have to learn where the keys are but as large as this keyboard is it should be spaced just little bit better to standardized keyboard the return is way off am keeping it because it matches my mouse and it pretty know my fingers will eventually learn to reach yes reach for the return but right now it sorry just blows the product has potential to be super amazing and have no doubt they have production crew willing to get it there which is exactly why took the time to write an honest and detailed review 
negative,don waste your time horrible quality and does not work with macbook air
positive,my daughter loves it cute color and works great 
neutral,bought this mouse as the color and led were quite cool would expect it to work like normal mouse but when clicking one has to click quite hard for it to work moreover there is lag when moving the cursor while using the mouse thought it was battery issue but even after charging it the same thing happened

neutral,really loud and clear sound
neutral,the product description is correct and found nothing wrong with the headset it has both pin jack and usb connector on the end it did not work quickly on my pc did not do any problem solving because did not like the fit the pads are oval and not as soft as wanted wear glasses and so they pushed my ear around the glasses and were uncomfortable for me there was nothing wrong with them they just were not for me 
positive,this is good set of headphones but if you use the microphone for gaming the majority of people say you sound like you are talking into tin can down hallway lol
negative,so disappointed this promised to be cute and functional mouse but it never worked not even for day charged it followed all directions am tech proficient and it wouldn even turn on feels cheap too so not surprised so disappointing to purchase things that don work all too common anymore 
neutral,listen it does the job of keyboard but the multicolored lights are fixed you cannot make them go white so at times it actually impossible to see the characters on the keys if you re dealing with the glare of monitor 
positive,this mouse is very light almost too light since you don place batteries inside ultimately that why returning bc need mouse that can pick up easily also the led lights don look like the picture 
positive,bought to replace older belkin that had no wheel trying to learn cad so the wheel is necessary this mouse is amazing can believe the cost my girlfriend stole it to take to work so ordering another one very impressed

positive,i was so happy with this mouse when first got it very comfortable loved the light and most of all the wireless feature the love affair however was short lived after using the mouse for only months it stopped working would charge it it would run for minutes then dead again it got to the point that the only way the mouse would work is if kept it plugged therefore defeating the wireless feature

positive,at first this keyboard was everything wanted in wireless keyboard have always been skeptical of wireless keyboards it worked wonders at first but as started to work with it there would be very random connection issues where it would not register my typing this seller was kind enough to send me second keyboard even and the same issue was happening really do think it was an issue with my very many wireless electronics nearby but never found out what the issue was however gave this star rating because of how well it worked when it did and for the customer service don leave very many reviews but this seller really does deserve credit for great customer service experience as well as making great product however unfortunate it did not work for me they were even kind enough to send me gift for the inconvenience and gave me coupon voucher for their other products excellent service

negative,battery life is terrible and mouse stops working from time to time no idea how this product has such high reviews 
neutral,i got this for my laptop and it does not work very well it skips or just does not move at all gave it to my grandson thinking that since it says it for gaming that maybe it would work better for him but he does not like it at all he says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected

positive,i like this mouse very much it moves smoothly and is small so there is no discomfort for my hand the only thing do not like is the on off switch it is very small and hard to make it move 
positive,we tried the charge too small for our needs extreme was too much base the charge is just right has lots of sound for an outdoor venue we are wanting to have music at yet can be turned down to still hear the clarity of the instruments the battery stays charged for days of playing definately hours or more we bought two to sync together for our outdoor gathering area we have been quite happy with this model

positive,i needed couple of these for my kids for their laptops knew they would like the vibrant colors the mouse shows while you are using it and that would love the rechargeable and quiet functionality the mouse definitely has exceeded my expectations of it and couldn be more pleased at this product the ergonomic fit and soft quiet buttons make the experience using this mouse very easy going ve burned through many mouse myself some very expensive name brand ones that should ve done their job and then some but ve always found defect in them down the road so far so good with these and could see the durability of this product especially given my twin year olds will use them to their fullest great customer service to top it off and highly recommend this mouse for anyone in need of one or is looking for the right one

neutral,this is fine speaker but none of your usb chargers will work with it that brings the score down to for me it pretty useless 
positive, good quality for the price recommended it to anyone looking for good deal
positive,i just received this headset and so far it really great for long gaming nights with the boys 
negative,sadly no one said in the comments that the sound is piss poor and no one can hear you speak there no setting to adjust and oddly enough both connections are on the same cord returning these because have zero use for them spend little more money and get something of value 
neutral,battery didnt last close to even could of included sting like with the flip 
positive,husband loves them he wears them everytime he plays the game can be yelling his name for minutes and he will not hear me with them on

positive,excellent mouse
positive,i had an issue with the original usb cord not working contacted customer support and they provided extremely generous resolutions the battery lasted me month without changing would absolutely buy from the company again
positive,ok so there is nothing wrong with this keyboard but nowhere in the description did it say that it had matte finish the keys have slightly sandpaper feel to them that just cannot handle as highly sensory sensitive person every time touch key it is like nails on chalkboard it was great price so decided to use it as keyboard for my tv used very infrequently instead of my primary computer keyboard rather than return it am now shopping for an alternative primary keyboard to use

positive,great most for extended casual use love that can recharge it and use it at the same time so there no down time or waisted batteries
positive,this portable speaker packs big sound in small package it offers truly great sound quality easy instant pairing to my iphone and nice design aesthetic got this to replace bose soundlink that was adorable and smaller but finicky when pairing with my phone very happy with this purchase for poolside tunes

positive,i like the way it produces quality sound and enjoyable 
positive,i love my mouse it so cute and works great 
neutral,i love this mouse works and looks great for the price very comfortable and smooth operation the charging cable that came with it didn work though but had another one so no biggie 
positive,i like this headset lot more than the red and blue headset the microphone quality has some issues using it on discord and can be little tricky to gauge the sensitivity but the sound is pretty good it is crisp for the most part love to use these headphones because they re also very comfortable 
positive,omg where do start love love love this speaker use mine all the time as hook up my spotify playlist to this kickin speaker and blast the tunes around my house the sound is perfect the shape is perfect using it is breeze and transports easily into the shower yes waterproof too did mention love this speaker

neutral,it took less than day for the receiver to fall apart in my usb port now the shell is stuck and have to take my computer to get it pulled out 
positive, small lightweight charged pretty fast and lasted quite while perfect for what we need recommend 
neutral,wire is good length but sad that it only lights up when plugged in to computer by usb the headphones extension is short in my opinion have to pull down all the way and it just barely fits on my head overall for the money paid think got good deal
positive,good fit good sound purchased on sale worth it 
neutral,it doesn charge anymore 
positive,i love colorful keyboards even though not gamer when purchased this one was thrilled to see how colorful it was how handy it was to just charge it up and not struggle with cord and find it has long battery life however have had consistent trouble with the layout of the keys the biggest problem have is the enter key when typing constantly getting the instead of the enter key thought would get used to it but haven for over couple of months other keys are little bit off what expect so frequently making typos when using apostrophes etc plan to keep it in reserve but ve ordered logitech keyboard because quite sure the keys will be in the places expect for touch typing 
neutral,nice product 
neutral,i have been using this mouse for days and the scroll wheel broke completely when pressed it it was alright in its short days comfortable but the scroll wheel clicked very loudly which didn like don waste your money 
positive,this product does not work with my macbook air it worked last night when first opened the box and it already won keep charge or charge at all buyer beware 
negative,i was really excited about buying this speaker when bought it because ve needed it for while and have lot of use for it at the moment however it has been completely unreliable for me because it hasn been able to hold charge think it has only been charged fully times and now it never charges the chargers used are brand new and the speaker is brand new did factory reset more than once and it still won charge the light blinks as if it is charging but it stays dead am so disappointed in this purchase and hope the speaker can be replaced or exchanged 
neutral,be very careful about leaving mouse plugged in cord caught fire while using it plugged in 
neutral,the scroll wheels does not work on this mouse
negative,i was very unhappy with this product it was way too complicated to connect to the pc returned the product and still having problem with the new one received instead

positive,space bar is bit sticky for gaming but it pretty good for it price
positive,the noise quality is really good also the way can hear it is really good also my friends all ask me what mic have because it so good
negative,after months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters you would think it would last longer than months before having issues like this it is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters quite disappointing time to find new keyboard 
positive,the type extension doesn work so it rendered it useless for my mac am able to use it on my pc for work just not the intended use bought it for the mouse itself is great light easy to use fits perfectly in my hand always connects and is reliable 
positive,light weight but sturdy great sound indoors and out 
positive,it cool and colorful love it 
neutral,once pulled it out of the box it sound worked but the mic did not peice of crap not worth the money
neutral,new update of all the damn products have bought did not buy an extended warranty for this product so guess am screwed update update not only is this keyboard is loud ad it finally stopped working thank god for year warranties update change the rating to star the keys have become louder over time please don buy this keyboard my friends on the phone say how loud the keys are all the time now want my money back granted they are not the clacky mechanic keys but close guess need membrane keys will try to take handed video later but every time hit the spacebar holy crap the damn noise it my fault was getting away from paying for another logitech keyboard that only glows dim white like the pretty colors this one has but when you put silent in the description it better be silent 
positive, let me start off this review by saying was very excited to get this mouse because it matched my desk my bedroom and my laptop perfectly absolutely loved the mouse right up until two weeks of having it and it completely stopped working don waste your money not worth it 
positive,i love these headphones there are super great fro my gaming and music as well
positive, minutes in game and already impressed lightweight comfortable and surround sound bought these to use for my ps and when you swing melee weapon you can literally hear it move from one side of the screen to the other 
neutral,for gaming noise cancelation 
neutral,directions suck charger sucks pretty color
negative,battery lasts less than half the time advertised not sure if received defective products or what previous version lasted much longer 
neutral,i loved this mouse at first however after just one one of using it it just stopped working one day even after being charged the night before nothing seemed to bring it back to life very disappointed as am outside of the return window by one week definitely do not recommend 
neutral,sleep mode works well
positive,works very well charges good love it
neutral,the wire is extremely long suggest wrapping half of it in small loop so don have so much extra
neutral,i bought this in late june it looks cool with the lights and all it doesn give warning that the battery is low just stops working now it is doing all kinds of weird stuff clicking on items that you didn etc too late to return oh well not recommended 
positive,the headsey is very good for gaming the mic works great people on the other side have said they can hear me more clearly and can hear them more clearly with the amazing sound quality and when put it on and play something can almost always only hear whats in the headset over all would definitely buy this again 
positive,won play charging when battery life gets low another lemon from amazon 
neutral,would prefer to buy bcz its cheap and nice
positive,it got delivered month ago and it has stopped working after using for like the th time it turns on them off immediately it got charge and just won work glad got my invoice since can still write it off as business expense not good product and will not buy again not very pleased with this device 
positive,its nice mouse but not sure if its good for gaming 
neutral,don waste your time with this mouse got this mouse for my work because the wireless mouse that had was loaned to me straight from the box it didn even work it will light up red whenever turn it on it won connect to my mac at all even with the port installed it wouldn work at all switched it off and on replugged in the port nothing would work what waste of money 
positive,very nice headphones stylish for gaming like pro and looks good around town too 
positive,son loved it 
positive,so easy to use and fits perfectly in my briefcase 
positive,never have to max out the volume and it has an amazing battery life like to workout almost everyday didn have to charge it for close to weeks 
negative,bought these headphones for my son to use with his ps he can hear others just fine but the mic doesn work very disappointing just arrived and took it out of the box today 
neutral,it basically junk doesn hold charge it works fine as long as its plugged into the charger but that defies the purpose of wireless mouse
negative,it been just over month and it already broke so disappointing because did enjoy using it
neutral,could use an instruction sheet also what is the expected battery life on single charge 
positive,this thing is terrific it has shocking amount of bass for small speaker jbl pretty much nailed the design if were to complain it would be that the base is little narrow use the speaker by my pool and dont want to bump the speaker and it roll into the pool again for you people that are complaining about it being mono its an engineering choice to deliver performance in other areas do you have to have stereo drivers that will be inches apart is that really needed of course not if that bothers you there are ton of other devices that might be better fit but doubt it will deliver as well in the other areas have an old bt stereo speaker and it does not come close to delivering sound on par with the charge going mono delivers more volume longer battery lower heat and simplified controls bass sucks power this thing gets pretty damn loud and really delivers ton of bass stream to it in the backyard when swimming in the pool it has really been great it has been accidentally kicked into the pool few times but no damage and it has proven to be water resistant as advertised 
positive,so teach prek and we have nap time what caught my attention was the quiet clicker didn think it would be as quiet as it is but it is extremely quiet it also easy to set up and easy to use 
negative,sounds terrible low not volume
neutral,small but solid 
positive,sounds good but so many of these companies spend more budget on marketing spinners rather than solid honest technology the talk of of these producing stereo via the app may or may not be true don mind buying two but this intentional vagueness really sucks we need more engineers and less marketers in this world engineers with budgets build good stuff marketers dance and hide stuff no mic for phone calls will update when abd if find the time to unravel the intentional fog others seem to have plenty of comments which may have good info happy with the mono sound so far will keep for now 
positive,work well great value so far
positive,nice key stroke but battery life could be improved bit
positive,i obsessed with this speaker not only is it the perfect size but also didn have to compromise the quality of volume or sound it gets so loud and it still clear have recommended this speaker to lots of my friends also the grey is such good color love it 
positive,loved by medical assistants throughout my office 
positive,battery life and quality is almost ok have sony xb years old and the power and sound quality is better than this one hoped more power in the new cargo jbl but am dissapointed overall it is good speaker for casual days 
negative,straight out of the package had issues but figured would hold on the mouse does not move smoothly cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly then it would stop and would have to jerk it around and now it has just stopped just upgrade spend little more on logi mouse and it is worth it 
positive,my son loves it 
positive,love it would recommend works great love that it light and can hear when you click the mouse lights are very cute
positive,intended to pair this charge with flip in jbl app to create stereo pair it can do it jbl app won allow it both speakers must be identical sent it back 
positive,these are heaven sent
neutral,i like everything about the keyboard very quiet
neutral,i loved this mouse used it for few hours of office work once every week or two so very light use in the scheme of things for computer mouse received it end of june and it is currently middle of december so about months until the roller scroller part of the mouse broke 
positive,there not the best but if your paying this amount of money say they are great definitely worth it
positive,i really enjoyed listening to the audible booktrack books on this speaker the background music and sounds are so clear yet not overwhelming the reading of the books 
positive,great for my yr old
neutral,cool product for kid if the scrolling wheel in middle doesn keep breaking 
positive,using for work meetings and for music pretty good quality for the price 
positive,my first gaming headphones and their great noise cancellation is little light but audio works well

neutral,microphone stopped working after months
neutral,very nice keyboard
positive,i bought it to keep it at work and everyone loves it the sound quality is great and it gets very loud bass can be adjusted 
positive,the sound had great quality would recommend it
neutral,decent speaker for its size but not recommended for larger rooms 
positive,no problems for now not the most comfortable but given the price it good
neutral,the receiver is located at the bottom of the mouse which is theory is great idea however it stuck way too deep and can get it out without breaking something very sad 
neutral,the headphones work as headphones the mic is so poor though that it barely works no one can hear me unless yell now wasn expecting amazing mic quality but it simply does not work was on pc using the splitter it came with and then another splitter owned both work just not the headphones compete on my school esports team and these flopped during practice
positive,i bought this product because we are family of gamers that like to play on different consoles these headsets have been awesome and were easy to use the sound quality is great and really drowns out all outside distractions would definitely recommend 
positive,incredible it is so good you can mute yourself while gaming without going to settings and doing it 
positive,marvelous
neutral,first time that need to change the battery and it doesnt work anymore no duro ni meses 
positive,i have charge and when the charge went on sale had to get another one love these little speakers
positive,nice headset blue lights are cool addition the headset is comfortable and works great well worth the price 
neutral,product was defective 
neutral,if you want an led mouse for aesthetics dont buy this brand this has flashing red led that is seperate from the rgb leds it stays on even when the led switch is not on 
neutral,cheap and doesn work 
neutral,this product is great ll have to but nd unit to have more sound throughout the beach house 
neutral,this product already fell apart it very lightly used and the mouse is broken already 
positive,these charge speakers are great bought more to go with couple already had they easily sync up with each other which makes it easy to fill larger spaces with great sound if you put them in corners they sound even fuller wish that the charge still had to ability to take phone calls but guess that isn that big of deal the batteries have listed all day and more it is also handy that can charge my phone from them as well 
negative,i really like the feel and look of this mouse don like that anytime stop using the mouse for minute or two that the mouse doesn react end up turning it off and on again to get it working interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time stop using it edit today is day of using the mouse while wait to receive the other mouse bought the mouse no longer consistently turns on when turn it off and on again to stop it from lagging 
neutral,i like the shape and the way the mouse works unfortunately can even make it through whole day of work without it needing to be charged again 
positive,i don normally like using mouse when am on my laptop but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so decided to purchase mouse when looking for mouse wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back it fits my hand perfectly and enjoy how sleek it looks the only thing that would change is being able to decide the color and color patterns other than that it was worth the purchase 
neutral,it was working fine busted it maybe times max and it stopped workingit looks to be charging but isn when placed into on mode the red light flashes and goes off right away 
positive,its awesome im able to talk better and hear better
positive,grabbed this for my laptop so don have to mess with the trackpad for work after days of use it no longer holds charge not the fault of the charge port as switched it to different one to be sure the price is too good to be true 
positive,this company deserves stars for their incredibly prompt and wonderful customer service this company truly stands by their product my klim keyboard stopped working after about years since they had year warranty reached out and they quickly responded they asked me to shipped the defective keyboard back to them they would refund the shipping cost and they would also send me new replacement keyboard in the meantime however realized really don care for this keyboard layout don use this keyboard for gaming it primarily for work so the short enter key was irritating at times unlike standard keyboard this one has three keys in between the and enter keys rather than just two keys like typical keyboards so declined their replacement offer didn want to go through the shipping hassel for replacement that don care for was just going to cut my loss look for something else and thought that was the end of it however they immediately offered me full refund or the option to try the upgraded version that has the standard layout the light opted for the latter the keys in the upgraded version are very quiet and feels bit mushy but it works great and highly recommend this company you can definitely purchase with confidence they really do stand behind their warranty and the level of customer service they provided was top notch they were extremely caring easy quick and hassel free 
neutral,i unboxed it plugged it into my laptop after charging it and it would not even connect to my computer at all completely dissatisfied with my time and money with this product if you re looking for mouse this isn it 
positive,legitimately the thing that mattered most to me was that the cord was all covered so wouldn get the exposed wire situation and these have full rope like coverage these have that and they also have great sound quality 
negative,i use this keyboard with my gaming laptop only when not using my gaming desktop the keyboard is quite nice and responsive but the battery dies very fast use it maybe mins day and it dies in week would much rather have less backlighting and aa batteries can swap out hate when it dies in the middle of game and then have to plug it in and wait while it charges 
positive,kids said they look like an awesome space set they love their new gaming headsets 
neutral,i liked it all
positive,my jbl sounds awesome so far it has the best sound then any other blue tooth speaker have ever had absolutely love it 
positive,it doesn have tail so it more of hamster but it is very nice hamster it lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor can speak on it for gaming as only use it for working from home but did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well obviously did indeed by it again

positive,this mouse works like charm it is beautiful the changing colors are fantastically fun this fits nicely in my backpack for use with my laptop 
neutral,it is almost perfect escept the assembly gap is big some dust dirt tiny food waste will go in easily
positive,this is such great mouse it works so well and love the pretty colors it also doesn make any noise while clicking which was my priority would definitely recommend this 
positive,great product
positive,wasn expecting much because it seemed low priced but have been using daily for work for about month now and it wonderful no issues actually bought two of them one grey and one gold and they both work fine 
positive,this mouse is on point literally had never thought of buying one to this slant and size until the color locked me in it an absolute match to my laptop the setup was quick and easy simply turned it on input the usb and was using within seconds it very versatile and works with or without pad lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape 
neutral,cant wait to do business with again thanks again
neutral,it sure looks nice but there no patch fix update to make this compatible with the new os boo hiss 
negative,laptop slipped of my lap and obviously landed on thw protuding hardware troubling as have much to do ive not acustomed to the finger pad 
positive,fits comfortably and it is very pretty 
neutral,although this mouse is nice and worked well for work it is not meant for extensive use after exactly one month this mouse no longer works in addition this coincides with the return window closing literally yesterday 
neutral,it pretty decent headphones for the price you pay
negative,i ordered the teal charge and was sent the camo one little disappointed and it only comes with charging cord not wall plug especially the money pay for this speaker

positive,i love the sound quality this is great product for the price 
positive,worked fine for month won work after 
neutral,love this mouse overall beautiful lights fits well in hand responsive but wheel broke after less than one month of regular use for design work very sad this is the second mouse ve bought first lasted months same issue because like it so much unfortunately will be looking for something different for my next mouse 
positive,i was looking for wireless rechargeable mouse because recently lost my old mouse but kind of glad did because really love this one it super cute sleek and the lights are so pretty the clicks are quiet like it says in the description and easy to use would recommend this to anyone looking for mouse 
positive,my son loves these for using with his tablet or plugging into the nintendo switch 
positive,this mouse is slimmer than others since have small hand it is very comfortable to use great buy 
positive,very chic and love the way it lights up it has two settings either leave the lights totally on or have them cut on as you tap on the buttons works wonderful and have only had to charge it one time since ve had the mouse 
neutral,poor quality does not hold charge has sleek design but mouse does not work as intended 
positive,so for anyone wondering charging it is easy if you plug it and the light in the middle is blue that means that it is not fully charged the blue light will turn off after being fully charged mine arrived on monday and on wednesday it turned off plugged it in and took around hours to charge it the light turned off the clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use one thing do not like is the scroller which can be little too hard tend to open many tabs at once at work and while am on pinterest lol but that just me overall is nice mouse and hope it can stay with me forever this is my th mouse in less than year 
neutral,i bought one and it broke st week the second one doesn work properly
neutral,barely had it months and the scroll wheel on top stopped working now it pretty much useless 
neutral,reacts little slow
neutral,it was great while it worked with the first one that got then it started not working and messaged the sellers and they send me another one tell me how the new one didn work at alllll such terrible product don waste your money or your time trying to make it work 
neutral,i decided to start write reviews because of these speakers literally when you get something from internet based on people reviews you should take this one seriously base very load without losing quality the sound is incredible fast connection and very very long battery life and real waterproof
positive,arrived very well packaged with special note included that made me laugh worked immediately out of the box and have not had single issue with it so far had it about week 
positive,i got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest love the led colors with the mouse although rarely change the settings love that don have to switch batteries and all have to do plug it in could tell after about week including me leaving my mouse on few times that it was time for charge my mouse began to lag and went ahead and plugged it up also the color of the mouse matches with the picture well
positive,sounds great gave it to my father as christmas present and he loves it 
positive,got this keyboard as replacement for previous wireless keyboard liked the multi colored backlight functionality however what do not like is that the lights turn off after about seconds of no use wanted this keyboard to stay lit up but it just doesn do that still works and functions like good keyboard just hoped that the lights would stay on longer 
positive,i ve read lot of the one star reviews and have to say my experience is far far different following are few tidbits from my use of these jbl speakers have purchased seven of these from amazon five for my daughter and her family and own two myself the eq is controlled from the player you have connected to these speakers not by the speaker have cycled thru the eq on my mp player and the jbl picks them all up no there is no separate charge cord read the ad it says exactly that don act surprised when you open the box no wall charger just usb cord for charging true stereo separation for all you audiophiles out there requires minimum of three to six feet of speaker separation with home stereos not likely to be achieved by any speaker small as jbl but big fat so what use mine in the shower put it on ledge and wow wonderful sound quality with more volume than ever need quality costs money you will always get what you pay for go cheap get cheap if you go to the vendor list and grab the cheapest one out there don be surprised when you get look alike which in not made by jbl hooking up number of these speakers and spreading them around the room may sound as if the signal was getting to some slower than others appearing to be lag all of the speakers are getting the signal at exactly the same time what you are experiencing is the audio output doppler effect ll let you look that definition up by yourself so space the speakers closer to each other battery life you will experience great deal of battery life if you keep the volume down to reasonable level crank it up to full blown party time and it will eat up battery power truly hope my comments help to answer some of the questions posed about the jbl speaker no do not work for amazon or jbl am simply user wishing to put light on some misunderstandings john
positive,i use this with my macbook pro and it works great very quiet and smooth 
neutral,broke after months we were satisfied untill they broke 
neutral,stop working in weeks
positive,works great lights are not too bright goes great with the gaming pad 
positive,awesome for many reasons backlit for dark living room at night no batteries rechargable and comfortable keys stars 
positive,this speaker was great addition to my back deck it provides just enough volume and bass to make music enjoyable without being too overpowering the charge port is great for friends who need to charge their phone while it plays our audio love it 
positive,don buy these they won last more than two months 
negative,the enter key is hard to press after month on these keyboards tried two of them but no difference im not out of the return window and am stuck with it 
neutral,good sound
positive,my home schooling student enjoyed the lights but it has stopped working entirely after months too late to return so fun for awhile but don expect it to last 
positive,i like it it comfortable it half as much as the one was buying and does exactly the same thing and the pretty lights make it good to look at also 
neutral,nice colorful led mouse that is still tethered to cord when in use for while
neutral,everything
positive,love it
positive,i love this mouse it easy to use when don use it for period of time it shuts off and with the click of the mouse its back on also love the changing colors 
neutral,the mouse is not chargeable don recommend buying it 
positive,i love this mouse it matches the decor in my home office perfectly 
neutral,i was not expecting that sound quality for this low price
positive,got this speaker as replacement for my original refurbished ue mega boom played that thing full volume on many occasions and after years although still sounding great feel the speaker might have ruptured bit decided to try jbl and didn want to get the charge because of the price and tacky huge jbl in the front think old speaker models offer great value as they sound great and are cheaper so far so good with this jbl plenty loud of course haven been doing full volume yet because cautious due to my previous ue experience love that it sits on its side and love the color we will see how it will hold up but so far great just as expected from jbl 
neutral,i really wanted to like this mouse as it lightweight and cute but it not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it not compatible with my macbook can use it while charging since have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging also lights stopped changing colors and you can set to one color 
positive,it cute guess it is pretty cheaply made you can just tell by the feel of it got the matte black one it charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge love the nano usb plug it came with cord but just use my phone charger it does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom the instructions are all in chinese but using it is pretty easy the nano fits in little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter it is quite flat so not the best for long term use like with gaming ll keep it but wouldn purchase it again for the price update have used this cheap little mouse for hours every night since got it ve only had to charge it maybe once week the charge is phenomenal still works perfectly 
neutral,absolutely terrible did not work in any configuration out of the box they sold me piece of plastic that looks like headphones do not buy 
positive,its good mouse slim quiet and the battery lasts forever on one charge its not very durable though so don drop it luckily its snaps back in place if you do 
positive,this mouse has been great super quiet when you click and responds well when prompted the lights add nice touch and remind you to turn it off for the day 
positive,this mouse is perfect bought it to match with my keynote light up keyboard and it matches better than expected the colors change while gaming just as my keyboard does and it works perfectly for gaming and normal day to day use would buy again 
positive,easy on the hand looks great recharge easy 
positive,broke in two months purchased new from amazon wouldn power on amazon can return it because it was month over expiration should of had month year warrenty great product when it worked 
negative,i hated this item they described how easy it was to use and received mine and it does not connect after doing my research on it its suppose to be compatible with my laptop and its not so now have to order different one im very disappointed in this product 
neutral,this mouse works but has high pitch noise the entire time in use drives me crazy 
neutral,this thing literally started skipping after minutes of use
positive,it is great product for what paid for it is more durable than thought and give the extra boost was looking for 
positive,these headphones are amazing and love them so much the noise cancelation is okay it works but its not as perfect as thought it would be they are comfortable but they do not connect to my android phone the headphones only light up when you plug them into the spot where plug in my mouse so was bit disappointed about that but other than that they are super comfortable and love them so much 
positive,i really like this item it is lot better than the other ones was using great for gaming charges quickly and easy to get started with and it fits my small hand perfectly would definitely recommend this product 
positive,nice mouse portable works great silent like the changing colors
neutral,this is rechargable and therefore not wireless it must be plugged in to wire in order to recharge this is huge pain to have to deal with connecting it and tripping over wires etc for hours while it recharges compared to just swapping out some aa batteries in few seconds 
positive,works great so far
neutral,good
positive,the absolute best blue tooth speaker money can buy crisp clear sound with hard hitting bass can charge your smart phone and can withstand being submerged in water got great deal on this bad boy and bought the coolest color available so much power in small body jbl continues to deliver 
positive,great
negative,not going to lie not particularly impressed with this keyboard the reaction time is not all that great but what is really annoying is that there is no warning when the battery is low so you can be playing game and suddenly it stops working also no way that have found to tell how charged it is
positive,bought this for my daughter she really loves it it can be very loud even when it not at percent 
neutral,flashing lighted keyboard wholly separate from laptop performs the task needed big smiles
neutral,very good for gaming
neutral,the left ctrl shift cannot be combined with many shortcuts in browsers such as ctrl shift for developer mode 
positive,great headset microphone last about three months before it broke searching for good headset and this wasn it great sound excellent noise cancellation these gaming headsets take beating as none of them have ever lasted year play battle total and fps so communication is needed 
positive,i would definitely buy this again really enjoy this mouse 
positive,it great all is good very good 
positive,for the price they re not bad they aren the best at keeping noise out or in they just get loud causing little strain on the ears over an extended period of time but overall ve had them over month and use them almost everyday 
positive,really like the way this wireless mouse feels acts my last one died and now almost glad it did so could buy this love the led light color changing when it in use and the auto shutdown when it not it performed well and moves easily great value too 
positive,love it this mouse is very sleek and thin 
positive,excellent product use it for my ps and switch no issues at all highly recommend 
negative,sorry usually dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake it started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked now am using brand new macbook so maybe it the usb converter that might be problem but currently not fan 
neutral,does not work at all and will not connect to laptop dont waste your money
neutral,bought it for my husband during prime days he uses them for gaming and says they work well 
neutral,i purchased the rose gold and it matches my airbook charges fast and lasts long time between charges glad bought this wireless mouse use it for hrs day days week 
positive,it has great bass
positive,ok so just going to avoid beating around the bush and get right to it the headset is acceptable especially given the current pricetag but it not great it really not have sensitive ears had problems with them relating to heat and pressure so avoided headphones sets for while but eventually saw how for the world of gaming headsets dominate over earbuds so have been on the lookout for comfortable one ever since lil beating around the bush there know no more swear good the top headrest part is very soft and squishy we like this it blue love blue the cord is well made doesn look like it tearing anytime soon bad they re not that comfortable they re not torturous but have skullcandy headphones that are way easier to wear game sound is very average can hear decently but for games like fortnite that have bad audio to begin with this isn going to change anything ugly don know if this is defect but if you plug this into your phone or tablet and bend the cord lil while on call it ll hang up you watching youtube video cord moves slightly and it skips to the next video you see how infuriating this can be it pronged connection they have added usb connection only for the lights get it but at the same time just remove the lighting no one wants to have usb cord swinging everywhere when not using it on pc the mic doesn mute when you flip it up thought this was an industry standard but apparently not you have to manually mute your mic with the switch on the panel that dangles on your cord so that pretty much it honestly you be getting around the same quality with clearance pair at your local electronics store and without the very annoying end call bug would have returned but was too lazy eh it ll work as backup suppose edit bengoo customer service took the initiative and contacted me giving out refund to my amazement was concerned it was possibly scam but they worked with me to refund me without compromising any personal information whatsoever huge thanks to bengoo for having the service more popular companies should have 
positive,it works fine but honestly would suggest better quality one it fits weirdly around the head but the sound quality is fine you get what you pay for basically
neutral,scroller is squeaky and makes noise seems loose
positive,the jbl sounds good even when it is loud bluetooth was quick and easy the battery has not let me down like its portability
positive,made to seamlessly fit hands pleasure to use 
neutral,like the sound the look and the battery life last long long
positive,love this mousepad the clicking is silent and it looks pretty but the thing dies so fast work hour week from home and have to charge the mouse like every day
neutral,it doesn work
positive,this mouse is sleek and has great feel it doesn require batteries so it is great mouse to have the led light is an added bonus 
positive,for only few dollars over this works great and the sound is very good 
positive,sounds nice and unit is over the ear and comfortable 
neutral,quit working after months can get it to work anymore charging port is messed up have unplugged it once 
positive,i use it for watching movies on my pc have to say the sound is incredible feels like in movie theartre great bang for your buck stars 
positive,my son loves the keyboard as an extension of his school laptop he thinks the colors are cool and the ease of use is great we had slight problem with charging and contacted the company real person responded to my inquiry very quickly their solution was efficient and thoughtful and my son was back to using his keyboard in week this was good purchase made better by the good customer service that backs it 
negative,i have charged this mouse once since received it use it every day it been over month now and no signs of low battery yet crazy 
positive,works wonderful
positive,i didn know it was possible to like mouse so much it is very comfortable and smooth the battery life is pretty long don like having to charge it because sometimes forget to plug it in and then it goes dead the battery life usually last around week as long as can remember to charge it it is fantastic 
neutral,skips around and freezes when clicking on things save your money 
positive,works great
neutral,smoothe
neutral,i bought this mouse for work and it worked great the first month however after month it started working slower and slower and just stopped working not good use of money 
neutral,not great headset but probably good for somebody trying to get started with gaming 
neutral,the keyboard itself as keyboard works fine however there are few things that need improvement the backlight needs to be brighter and the individual keys need to stay lite up even when the backlight fades out need to give the user the option to select to keep the back light on constantly instead of just fading or off user that likes the back light to stay on not fan of the fading in out as it makes it hard to see the keys in the dark especially if trying to find numbers and symbols the enter key is too far to the right for comfortable typing selection meaning that the enter key should be where the key is normal keyboards have the enter key closer in this position so when typing we easily select the right key but you have the key where the enter key should be so it interferes and causes us to hit the wrong key the keyboard isn that quiet hitting the keys when typing softly the keys still make lot of noise 
positive,this little mouse works great for my needs it charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected would buy it again and recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse 
positive,my child love these and uses them every day will definitely buy again priced right
positive,i ve owned the beats by dr dre and it bigger heavier but cannot compare in any way to the jbl charge the bass sound is excellent the size is perfect and convenient to carry from room to room when you re doing housework bluetooth is strong too the only reason didn give it stars is because it doesn have remote but totally blown away by the sound quality 
positive,this wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up the led lights gives it nice look and the click is silent the battery last day haven had to change them over all mouse
positive,love it 
positive,keyboard did not want to work even after turning it on and off and restarting my computer usb was plugged in but could not type word even tried charging it and still nothing and just got it today when went to settings it showed the keyboard was there but wasn allowing me to type or even change the brightness of the lights on keyboard
neutral,stopped working after months 
neutral,it worked for about weeks plus afew days before it stopped working 
neutral,very smooth and quiet 
positive,received on time and enjoyed chatting with friends while playing ps these headphones are awesome no hiccups work as intended and am super satisfied with my purchase and will recommend this product thank you bengoo 
positive,it sounds lot more boosted than most of the jbl fast shipment and definitely worth the money it came well packaged and no damage from the looks and sound of it will update after couple months to give its life durability and charging device
neutral,bought of these the lights are fun and fit really well in smaller hands but these christmas gifts are no longer usable durability stinks my opinion would not buy

positive,easy to set up and the sound is amazing 
positive,it an awesome keyboard for any budget build rgb lights are great comes with different modes for the lights it quiet and they have amazing customer support 
neutral,this crapped out within three months invest in better quality mouse so tedious having to replace these cheap electronics so often 
negative,bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it not perfect match it still very pretty and love the lights it is very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse update so received this mouse exactly days ago and the scroll button is broke went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver very small btw it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in so not only did my brand new less than week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making fort nox screw not happy save your money 
neutral,the laser is broken it jumps everywhere on the screen 
neutral,is not usb it works well but plastic feels cheap and flymsy 
positive,excellent product

positive,very good for gaming the quality of the materials is not the best but it has very good sound quality for gaming also like the colors blue with black 
positive,its honestly so good
positive,i bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading then realized the on off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions one click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear will say the white mouse is almost translucent the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse not just the sides it plug and play very easy to use and comfortable 
positive,it allows me to play with my friends hear clear and rhetoric bbn was reasonable 
positive,this headset has excellent quality for being such reasonable price it has really long cord which is nice if you get up so you don yank on cords use it to play rainbow six siege and it helps me win 
positive,i decided to venture out to different model since my previous model was the amazon speakers which has lasted me up to the present time would have preferred the tall cylinder type to the one bought but will take while to adjust overall pleased with the purchase

positive,comfortable and awesome sound
neutral,crap item did not work can hear but can not be heard item does not light up not sure it supposed to didn realize no returns sucker
neutral,mousewheel doesn work yikes
negative,no longer powers on or charges after months junk 
neutral, 
neutral,good sound quality for beginners
negative,the product is as pictured and even works as described however it stopped working after less than week have tried to charge it using different ports and wall outlets checked the usb bluetooth connection and even disconnected and reconnected however it is still failing to work am in the process of returning and will be looking for new replacement elsewhere 
negative,i initially liked this mouse but after month it stopped working terrible product waste of money
negative,definitely not noise cancellation with terrible quality speakers and bad mic that no one in the game can hear do not recommend this as gamer to other gamers
neutral,i like how it sounds even though was not the color picked 
positive,this product is very good for noise cancellation and is long lasting very recommended
neutral,my grandson gammer 
positive,this speaker has stellar sound quality for the money the base is fantastic for the size of the speaker actually didn expect it to sound as good as it did it is waterproof which was just what we were looking for it hard to finda good waterproof speaker that will truly withstand more than sprinkle of water but this one passes the test our teenage kids love using it to bluetooth the music from their phones out by the pool so you know it has seen it fair share of water it also comes partially charged which was nice we had music within minutes of taking it out of the box it lasts about week on charge if we use it intermittently ve never left it on for more than hours at time so can speak to how long it would last continually off of single charge 
neutral,this was good for couple weeks and then the reception became extremely poor would personally go for another keyboard in my opinion also amazon will not refund it bs if you ask me just go with wired keyboard 
neutral,excelente
positive,this product is amazing it was for my daughter for her birthday and she cant stop talking about how great that they function awesome for gaming definitely has noise cancellation because she cant hear me when holler for her sound quality is amazing as well 
positive,fantastic keyboard for its price
positive, needed new cheap mouse and this was on sale and read through lot of reviews saw lot of reviews stating that there was chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top well that sounded cool to me so ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same pleased to report that it does so be warned that ordering the white version has chance to do this and apparently often find it fun though also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse so when not in use it will conserve it battery power by turning off clicking with the mouse will turn it back on battery life has been good so far too work from home for hrs day and it survives my work day easily just plug it up to charge after work 
positive,very comfortable and the sleep mode works well it looks good too
positive,i love the quality and power that jbl delivers they never leave you hanging there it was delivered promptly the box was undamaged the packaging the speaker came in was pristine and the product itself was clean as ordered and has exceeded expectations would definitely buy this again or even the bigger better model 
positive,the usb plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port can pull the usb out but the case stays inside the port it still useable if put it back in though it also has very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves especially when it used close to the usb plug it is not silent that for sure have to use music or headphones when use this mouse or it drives me insane it shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand but have arthritis so usually need thicker taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable but bought this mouse as backup for my work laptop so don use it as much as use my gaming mouse like that you can still use it when it plugged in to charge if you use longer cable 
negative,i bought this because wanted portable speaker with an old fashioned aux input unfortunately the aux input has horrible flaw if couple seconds of silence go by in whatever you re listening too the speaker shuts off and only starts back up after it gets some signal again you ll lose about half second of audio as it turns on again too like let say you re listening to an album couple seconds of silence between tracks is enough to cause this and you ll lose the first little bit of the folllowing song because it shuts off and then turns on again only after something loud enough to turn it back on again happens so so annoying after little internet sleuthing found out that this is just how they are apparently you can fix it by shorting chip on the motherboard but not doing that returning it rip jbl really dumb 
positive,i love this for going to the beach or just hanging out in my back yard it has great sound and gave few as gifts 
neutral,i use this to keep out the noise that goes on in my house live with kids so it can get quite noisy around me and these do good job with keeping the noise out 
positive,shipping was fast and loved the leds but today after week it stopped working figured it needed charge it now been connected to my laptop for over three hours and the blue light has gone off which is supposed to mean is all charged and ready to go but when disconnect it nothing dead guess the low price was giveaway should have paid more attention to 
positive,sounds quality is amazing battery last very long and the overall built quality is just good never ever reviewed something and gave it five star but this one absolutely deserves it 
positive,i mainly purchased this to use in very dimly lit area the keys are not quite illuminated enough for me other than that its great 
neutral,started out great but after about weeks and when the return window closed will not hold charge it charging when the blue light is on only stays on for second after plugging in if there were stars would give it that didn even have enough time to really use it only got about uses before it wouldn charge 
neutral,backlight stopped working after first day of use the settings for the backlight do not work and customer support on their website has not responded keyboard works otherwise 
positive,the design and color is awesome also bought this product for my as well and would definitly recommend this product to family and friends there is nothing to dislike about this product
neutral,i bought one for my laptop and days after got it the wheel stopped working and could hear something loose inside it returned it for replacement the new one seems to be working fine although sometimes the cursor glides smoothly across the screen and other times it jumps around lot maybe this is just something wireless mice do don know ve never had one before 
positive,this headset is very light weight and quality is very good lights on side looks the headset very nice good product for your money 
neutral,this is by far my favorite mouse can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse goes to sleep saving me bit in new batteries if didn notice the mouse sliding off the laptop and onto the chair laser up would be changing the batteries frequently this one recharges no batteries to buy 
positive,easy to set up stable on most surfaces charging cord could be longer perhaps feet long 
positive,this jbl charge sounds amazing loud and nice base 
neutral,pros matte feel slim profile quiet clickcons instructions were in another language so there wasn any information on how to set up guessed came with scratch on it track wheel does not work 
positive,perfect no comment everything is pretty good
positive,great mouse when it works sleek design good performance six week after got it it stopped working it is just few days past the product return deadline have written to the manufacturer lets wait what happens 
positive,i needed and slim mouse that was rechargeable this little mouse saved the day it is ergonomic and glides smoothly on the mouse pad am pleased with this purchase and the changing lights are an extra bonus good quality product 
neutral,i bought this headset in december and so far it been great this headset allows me to hear enemy footsteps in the game much clearer compared to my old headset recommend this to anyone who needs an affordable headset 
neutral, nice for the price would buy again 
positive,i love this mouse easy to set up easy to use it seems to go forever on one charge and the ever changing light color is really cool 
negative,got it because it matched my new rainbow keyboard but it was very disappointing mouse chose when and where to work causing my cursor to jump all over the screen and not respond
negative,i have had this mouse for less than months that and the rolling ball has stopped working that sucks 
neutral,this mouse looks good but that it it works poorly finally gave up and went back to my old wired mouse it just doesn work well you end up wildly moving it around and getting the cursor to where you want it to click on something is struggle would not recommend this mouse 
neutral,cord don take beating at all
neutral,i love the light weight fee to this mouse but unfortunately it doesn hold charge to be able to use it 
negative,extremely disappointed these are not gaming headphones you can not hear left from right it all mixed together quality is bad and will definitely not being buying again
positive,jusk ok good quality
neutral,it was made of cheaper plastic then expected and refused to charge after it ran out after the first time wasn enough money to make it worth my time trying to return it the color change was cool was it lasted 
positive,the color wasn like the photo it bit darker than what was expecting see photo for reference did love that the mouse came with usb to usb adapter the part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was stuck so had to use excessive force to remove it only other thing could change is the led colors it goes through series of colors but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be 
neutral,gaming
neutral,it no for me 
neutral,don spend your money on this crap
neutral,wheel stopped working after return period no mistreatment 
neutral,tru
positive,i can power keyboard off when not using it so that plus ve not had to charge it yet but that due to barely using it so definitely worth the money
neutral,very nice color
positive,ive had this about year the key board worked great if the receiver is infront of my pc my keyboard is only ever ft away it has slowly come to thiscurrently foot and half away and have to pick it up to type while it plugged in to bring it closer ths sna sewt rendem is what was received while trying to say this is only somewhat recent development 
negative,wanted keyboard with backlit could use at night when doing work got it at the end of november and as of january it no longer works wouldn buy it again waste of 
neutral,not loud enough strange soud quality makes music sound wierd

positive,very good nice sound mic doesn have problems
neutral,it really is
positive,great 
neutral,it deserves stars for not working can hear my game at all super uncomfortable too expensive to not work
neutral,for gaming the sound is good nice for sound whores but the earmuffs are not that soft and are uncomfortable if you play for long
positive,the product has good sound quality and can produce good sound the feature of being able to mute with switch and being able to adjust the volume is nice 
neutral, use for meetings and it works just fine 
negative,it really waste of money bought it in august and started falling apart end of sept and completely broke in nov not worth the money 
positive,my son wanted this for his macbook so will tell you it needs an adapter the macbook doesn have usb port but after that he is pleased with the performance he uses it to play games too and says it is responsive 
neutral,good headphones for the price
positive,my grandson loved them
neutral,easy to use
positive,i purchased this with the hope to use it for my home office to get rid of my corded mouse was very surprised when was scrolling and all of the sudden the scroller seemed to sink deeper into the mouse took it apart in hopes to fix it only to find that the scroller just snapped off 
neutral,i was surprised about the great sound it connected almost by itself with my computer it makes my computer sound system sort of portable disappointed that the receiver sound stops as soon as connect the jbl computer cannot send bluetooth signal and hard wired signal to the receiver at the same time maybe need new computer 
positive,great mouse nothing super fancy comfortable to use the lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life holds charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary plugged in to different computers and worked immediately on both seems quite reaponsive but only use it for general computer work so dont know how it would work for gaming all in all great mouse for decent price will update if anything changes
positive,the headphones are very nice and noise cancelling great headphones 
neutral,it stopped working after months
positive,this is out second one we have them linked and the sound is great highly recommend 
negative,really not the best
positive,this product is awesome love how the sound quality is perfect and the only thing is that after about hours it starts hurting your ears but barley but overall love this product so would totally recommend buying this and ve looked at many headphones and this was the best one yet 
neutral,thing sounds great until it shorts literally had the thing month and it shorted out and will not work contacted jbl harmon and was essentially scoffed at since then ve replaced both the battery and motherboard to no avail cannot remember the last time wasted nearly like this 
negative,the only way the lights works if you plug into the xbox port then there is inch cord to plug into the controller for the mic which doesn work very poor design 
neutral,as lot of other reviewers said the scroll wheel broke have had different usb mouse for years without this problem ll be going back to it the battery life is also very short constantly having to recharge it 
positive,i ve had this speaker for some time now like years today my wife and drove from our house to the store about miles away in the rain turning into the lot hear rattle on top of the car where put my speaker when was cleaning the garage and forgot about so whip into space freaking out that lost broke my speaker forever but it was still on the car jerking into the space made it fall though grabbed it turned it on connected played great this thing survived fall off my car after driving miles in the rain no regrets for this purchase 
positive,from the day received all my touchpad headaches are gone wonderful product that keeps me enjoying the clicks without any noise no headache of battery life recharge and go mouse that signals more than meters distance the color attracts and keeps me cool during operation 
positive,product loos great and it feels awesome however am experiencing huge issue when it comes to the keyboard not responding to me typing have to turn the keyboard off or plug in usb cable to it and sometimes it still acts as if didn enter key this is very frustrating ve checked to see if it was device drivers anything that not updated on my system manufacturer website etc still experiencing this issue does anyone know how to resolve this if so this product would definitely receive tar rating 
positive,connects easy and the keys type well well made and not heavy if you need to travel with it 
positive,great value for the money letters on keyboard rub off after few months
positive,its amazing love it
neutral,the mouse was working good and out of no where in the middle of me working it clicker just stop functioning unfortunately purchase this item on the th of january and my return window is now close really felt confident about this product and it is was nice while it lasted edit was spent replacement and it has given me any problems

positive,i loved this mouse until it stopped working after about month of use it is plugged in and charging but is not responding to movement after about ten minutes ve tried multiple ports and turning it on and off but the thing won respond it illuminating in just blue which it never done before don buy it
positive,i really love how easy it is to setup this mouse nothing to download just plug and play have been looking for slim mouse that works on my mac and windows machine that doesn need batteries or mousepad and this definitely fits the bill the lights are cute fun addition but are subtle enough to not be distraction while using and don seem to drain the battery too much overall think it great for anyone looking for something easy to use 
positive,got these headphones for gaming absolutely love them 
negative,it works ok nothing spectacular if you re gamer or use the mouse quite bit you have to charge it about once day or it starts lagging and causes things to crash or freeze up due to the lag 
positive,i really loved the size and feel as well as how quiet it was but it only lasted about months before it completely crapped out and never worked again suppose it good short term solution 
neutral,like the mouse but having to recharge it with usb all the time is annoying and unproductive

positive,i really needed mouse because it is so much easier when working from my laptop searched on amazon and came across this vibrant mouse fell in love and decided to buy it it was the best decision because this mouse is fantastic and works perfectly love the color variations and the sleek look it is easy to setup use and also easy to charge it is also wireless which makes it even better 
positive,can beat the sound for the size this jbl speaker has been perfect speaker we just replaced our with this model crisp clear and loud if needed lasts forever it seems and connects easy with bt 
positive,charged up quickly in little over an hour looks great feels great but the scrolling wheel does not work looking at it closely it looks like the wheel is slightly off center it spins freely like it isn connected to anything back it goes

neutral,used it only for the past months and it doesnt work anymore 
neutral,the sound quality both playback and recording is fine however find the earmuff portion of the headset to be bit too small as it does not fit around my entire ear and don have particularly large ears afaik this probably wouldn be huge issue for most people but if you have earrings it might be bit uncomfortable 
positive,can not believe how long the battery lasts very crisp and clear sounds way louder than it looks yes it actually is water proof 
neutral,the plug to use in macbook does not work really needed this mouse so had to go out and buy plug myself spending more money for what this should have come with it working now but only because spent more money

neutral,i like the compact shape and the changing light bar around it 
neutral,didn work
neutral,i got it for my husband he chose his colors lol it worked with daily use for about month until it died that when we figured we have to charge it which was fine but we cannot figure out how to tell when the battery is low and it needs charging

neutral,battery last forever accidently left it on over the weekend and still didn need to charge it until tuesday it did take some getting used to the power save function you need to click to wake it up 
positive,this is the first day of use but the mouse looks nice got flat black like that there are no batteries charged quickly and super easy to start using its light and fits my small hand nicely the lights are nice as well and not annoying like that they can be turned off don plan on using the mouse for gaming so will not know how well it works for that sort of thing for me just basic computer work photoshop lightroom and think it will do nicely for those it seems quick and is working well even without mouse pad think it was for sure worth the price so far its nice basic mouse think

positive,i absolutely love this mouse it well built and has so many features that similarly priced mice don have it so whisper quiet and smooth as can be it also rechargable which helps out ton 
neutral,gaming on my iphone
negative,i was excited to try wireless keyboard and really thought would like this battery life would last about full day and half but it charged fast the lights made it easy to type at night which was also bonus typing with it was sort of annoying noisy but could have forgiven that if the product was actually decent after few weeks the typing just got completely laggy and every few keystrokes missed it became impossible to type on plugging it in with the charge wire didn fix the problem so switched back to my old wired keyboard waste of money for how fast this broke down 
neutral,only last months before it quit working
neutral,product never worked defective
negative,i think it good sound quality isn bad the mic isn bad either 
neutral,you won hear the annoying clicking sound from this mouse 
positive,it light and lights up so nifty
positive,this is perfect for my son to use with his xbox 
positive,so far have been satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend it to others the one issue is the special cord to recharge the keyboard and the ability to match the lighting to my laptop do understand the limits on the battery life that prevent the keyboard from staying active all the time but would like to be able to dim the keyboard when inactive but with the light still bright enough or at least marker key to engage the lights to make it easier to see in the dark it may be little nit picky but the purpose of the lights is to allow me to see and enjoy the back lights while playing and not have to stop and turn on light just to re orient my self to the keys while trying to immerse myself in game 
positive,i use it for work as dispatcher work at night in dark room so love the colored lights great keyboard
positive,great headphones excellent sound quality
positive,i have loved their products mainly the gaming headset they are perdectly listenable and can play without getting tired also its wireless mouse is better than ever its design is perfect and it can be seen at night with its lights and everything is perfect would recommend your products to all my friends

positive,pretty good was hard to use at the beginning seemed like it didnt work it has sensitive spots but once you get used to it works just fine 
neutral,incompleto
neutral,i used this product once and tried to use it for my work laptop and the usb broke inside the laptop can get it out dont buy this it cheaply made
negative,i purchased this mouse thinking it had usb connector not usb with usb adaptor my bad opted to keep it three stars on its scrolling as it was not smooth but it worked would have kept it but after couple of weeks it died and would not charge despite being plugged in for hours don waste your money go with tried and true brand
positive,its not too heavy it produces great sound the battery life is great and the controls are simple and easy to understand 
positive,this wireless rechargeable mouse is exactly what wanted its light and just the right size for my laptop with so many options on amazon glad chose this product and the sleep mode function and colors are really cool would recommend this product to anyone looking for awesome mouse 
positive,this mouse is amazing very comfortable smooth and aesthetically pleasing charge lasts forever 
neutral,works as advertised 
neutral,this item only worked for less than days it was going well and then stopped holding charge
positive,what like everything what dislike nothing this review is actually the first thing that typing with this new keyboard the keys feel little spaced out but ve been stuck with tiny bluetooth keyboards using my phone as my computer which this works flawlessly with the samsung galaxy note and with the dex setup which currently utilizing feel like purchased much more expensive keyboard than what paid for this the packaging and items inside are esquisite the glow of the keyboard is bright and fantasticly appealing wish this had bluetooth format but maybe the next note will feature connectivity to ghz devices 
positive,we have been extremely pleased with this mouse we have an hp laptop it works wonderfully with it 
neutral,do not buy the headset needs special adapter to even work waste of money 
positive,ordered shortly after christmas and once arrived had issues connecting after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off after less than week and one charge it will no longer do anything no lights no power no connection and won charge with the included cord or any other spend the money on different brand this was like ordering from wish 
positive,as the title suggest it stopped working after week of use really liked the feel and look of the mouse so was pretty happy with it until today when it stopped working do not recommend 
neutral,product was great for the first two months it suddenly just stopped working even though its fully charged kinda of disappointment 
positive,great sounding speaker deep bass 
neutral,this item did not work from the very beginning sent it back will not purchase from this company again 
positive,i really liked the mouse at first it matched perfectly and was very convenient first thing noticed was how plasticy it was that didn bother me tho one day as was using the mouse to scroll the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse tried to fix it and couldn wasn pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk its cute mouse love the look of it but it is very cheaply made and will most likely break 
positive,it work super great recommend for other to buy
positive,i listen to music none stop all day everyday ve bought tons of different bluetooth speakers jbl is the best by far some would say they are over priced but if you can get that same sound quality and battery life plus durability out of something cheaper what the point your just robbing yourself get the good stuff
neutral,the keyboard is good it does not have any noise the light is cool but sometimes the keyboard would repeat press one key 
positive,love it works very well gets pretty loud 
positive,great speaker 
negative,almost every time type the keyboard always misses key press for some reason and have to do it again don know if it the key sensitivity or something else but it irritating 
negative,just spend dollars more this is terrible quality mic and speakers 
neutral,mouse wheel randomly broke months after purchasing mouse pretty disappointed in this 
positive,certainly helps to look at instructional pictures and to try to translate what the instructions mean

positive,this is great device easy to setup and use right out of the box excellent sound am using it outside as work on big construction project makes the work go much easier 
positive,this mouse is cute and convenient not heavy the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet works fine with my macbook air the only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with is very hard to insert it into the port that it comes but besides that everything works fine 
neutral,product came in as promised and it worked perfect can wait for my pc to come in and try these bad boys out 
positive,i using it at work and all day the battery lasted days before recharge ordered another one for home this is good product with good price
neutral,unfortunately the scroll function is already broken otherwise this is very cute and comfy mouse love the lights 
neutral,after maybe three months of use started experiencing issues with it staying powered on and connecting to my pc would try typing and the keys simply wouldn work and would keep turning off overall my experience with this keyboard has been very poor and don recommend it 
neutral,stopped working after week 
negative,horrible quality but not surprised for the price the led lights only are on when it charging the volume is so low when it all the way high definitely can wait to return it
positive,the mouse itself is great works well however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works it has only been weeks since purchase do like that the lights have an on off function so you don need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in work environment 
neutral,broke as soon as it dropped on the floor 
positive,gift for son thanks 
positive,better then set highly recommend 
neutral,cool header comfy too 
positive,i super love this jbl speaker my uncle had bought speaker not this one and it cost him and it was bigger than this one supposedly it one of the best brands and honestly it as loud as my uncle and this was cheap use the speakers almost every day and it lasts almost like days and half sometimes three and it charges pretty fast don regret buying this speaker super love it 
positive,update seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery they even went as far as sending me here how to remove link purchased this as an upcoming christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now the box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday let me just say am glad that did while the mouse powered on and worked fine with the usb dongle that it requires be plugged in to use decided to test it other feature of being able to charge it while using it everything worked fine until unplugged it once unplugged the micro usb cable from the mouse my entire pc turned off thought maybe it was just fluke so tested it again nothing happened the second time so plugged it back in for little bit to make sure it had full charge on it for her and when unplugged it to re package it it happened again as to say am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective moral of the store don buy cheap products 
positive,we loved our old one and this is the new version sounds great works well little bigger than the one it replaces so not quite as portable

positive,great product
positive,i like very much this rgb wireless keyboard the batteries last forever beautiful color and brightness very silent just love it
negative,i was so excited this mouse looks beautiful but it was one of the most frustrating devices have ever used when clicking to wake it up it would click on whatever may be on the screen at the moment including email or im drafts that have not yet been reviewed or perhaps written in anger and did not mean to send lol when you wanted to click on something you had to click several times overall frustrating very good return process no questions asked and quick refund that why stars

neutral,all around the product is bad bought it as christmas gift and the user can not speak to other people he can hear them fine the mic is turned on the settings on the console allow for chatting and he even reset the console to factory default beware of the cheap price tag as this is cheap product 
positive,great speaker

neutral,only used few times and the left click broke might want to select different one
neutral,these are not xbox compatible aux and usb jack only 
positive,they are great for gaming 
neutral,good price
positive,love the slim design easier on the wrist the buttons have good feedback as well 
positive,the wireless connection works great and mouse looks sleek and cool especially for the price 
positive, in all honesty there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for mouse but you know what in this time of the pandemic we can all use bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy especially visually this little mouse got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time always brings smile btw it is quiet no noisy clicks the color is beautiful and classic and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers if you re still on the fence get one or more if you want to give yourself little and very useful treat 
negative,battery only lasted hrs after fully charged not recommend returning it 
negative,i was looked forward to having this mouse but used about twice since got and it not working already don know if it defective or what guess there go my 
negative,the price for the item is good but sound quality is bad disappointed expected better sound quality 
neutral,its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse only downside is when don move the mouse for while you have to click the button to wake it up sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something didn want to click on or open update it died months later not worth it 
positive,the mic quit no way to contact the manufacturer bought an asurion protection plan and they won help either big waiste of money
neutral,the mouse got would make the pointer on the computer move without me moving the mouse and it constantly tried red even when it was on the rainbow setting and fully charged
negative,i got this mouse for my daughter it worked for the first few days then quit charging ve tried to charge with various cables and connectors but no success total waste of money would not recommend this product 
neutral,unfortunately was in hurry when bought this and didn take the time to read the other reviews hopefully you re taking the time to read them got it and it never even turned on made sure was doing everything right and even got my dad to look too but it wouldn charge the light would turn on when plugged it in for few minutes and then turn off it looks like other people had this issue but few weeks into using it so at least it broke in time for me to return still hassle
neutral,bought these for my son to use in his ps they would not work at all no audio out of the headphone and the mic does not work tried them on my pc just to double check and still nothing 
neutral,works great adjustable lighting stays charged for long time no chord in the way smooth keys light weight only small complaints when it is in sleep mode whatever key you hit to wake it actually works therefore you have possibly typed wrong key when using password to open something also you can pick one solid color again nothing major would buy another one or recommend it 
neutral,cord too long
neutral,works well
positive,great gaming headset with noise isolation it comfortable for long time use with sufficient support over the ears 
neutral,it good
positive,i kind of unsure how this has so many great reviews on my second in only months sometimes the keys randomly stop working or things like the scroll lock just randomly turn on when you have never touched it on mine the sicker where it tells you if the caps and num lock are activated is already starting to pull off again this is only after months do use it daily but that really shouldn matter also the space bar is super loud and inconsistent but if you are like me your would rather troubleshoot something instead of wasting something and just throwing it out tried contacting the company but that literally nonexistent amazon just kept giving me to the wrong site and there not number or email you go to contact them from amazon and they bring you to winter outerwear site those clearly aren the same companies would have loved some help instead of throwing this thing in the trash trying not to be wasteful here the battery will die randomly with no warning super inconvenient when you re just trying to work 
neutral,very cool lighting as seen in the photos and it soft touch mouse no loud clicks here 
positive,i love the mouse but sometimes it randomly stops working and my computer won recognize it noticed it did this when used the changing color settings recommend just keeping it on on and not the changing colors setting

neutral,usb plug is not recognizable by computers
neutral,very fragile when dropped 
positive,nice mouse and like that the mouse sleeps to save the battery

positive,sounds is perfect
negative,i liked the size and ease of charging but very dissatisfied with the lack of reliability and of course both stopped working just past the point could return waste of money useless without the scrolling wheel 
positive,i like that you change button on the back so it stays red and that the blue light stops showing once its done charging the only thing is wish it would show you how much battery it has left

positive,great sound very clear and easy to hear 
neutral,this mouse has very poor sensor it will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for bit and you sometimes have to click the dpi button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up the sensor also cannot move fast if try moving the mouse quickly the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like deja vu is playing in the background speaking of clicks the left mouse button double clicks quite bit the only thing this mouse has going for it is its design even then the design is uncomfortable since its so flat find better mouse please don torture yourself with this

neutral,the headphones are made for children heads the earpieces don cover an adult ears the plastic and shape of the headset itself feels cheap and breakable the microphone quality is atrocious and makes anyone speaking through it sound like the stereotypical kid screaming into mic on fortnite

positive, the black feels super soft just plugged it into my usb on my computer it also comes with usb adapter incase you don have that left and right button clicks softy not annoyingly middle scroll works great the click is bit louder and it won click onto document so that click that doesn do anything happy with this purchase it looks great at night and it such gamer music producer look 
neutral,the only thing dislike is the wire getting tangled 
neutral,i purchased this item to play world of warcraft also use wireless mouse and the keyboard doesn work in game if mouse usb is also plugged in wrote to klim and they were not helpful at all will probably return as it doesn work for me 
positive,i not mouse person prefer the track pad but need it for work absolutely love it even use it on my personal computer
positive,i was surprised how good this mouse no regrets 
positive,great quality great sound it great headset for the price would definitely recommend it 
neutral,not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about months and then poof no more just wouldn connect to my windows pc at all before that would have given it stars as it had the return button in weird placement compared to standard keyboards and it did seem to need charging more frequently than would have liked 
neutral,mouse was advertised as quiet but it is far from quiet it has the loudest sound have ever heard from mouse when clicking the middle button disappointed in the clearly false advertising 
neutral,easy to setup just plug in the usb and it works smooth cursor movement and clicking but the wheel does not scroll very well only moves the screen few lines and then it quits scrolling all together 
neutral,it received such low rating due to its durability dropped from about ft and was paper weight after and wasn possible to fix

neutral,liked but not for me needed bluetooth 
positive,works really well plus it looks nice great price too 
positive,this product is perfect am just using it as regular keyboard for my laptop but my gaming buddy immediately picked it up and was checking it out he seemed impressed with it and that was enough to have me sold on it the lights are great the keys feel perfect for typing as far as spacing goes the wireless is nice touch as well excited for years of use to come from this thing 
positive,this is the best rgb keyboard value you can find out there the size is jsut perfect not too big or too slow 
neutral,the only time cant hear anything is when have it on full volume
neutral,the one ordered will only turn on if the switch is in strange position that is between the clicks had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until found the very small area where it turns on sending it back because its almost impossible to use if the switch gets moved it takes few minutes to turn it back on 
positive,great keyboard and even better customer service highly recommend
neutral,glitchy and charge doesn last
negative,nobody order this piece of crap its trash cant even fortnite cause its too freaking twitchy
neutral,letters needs to be bolder not bright enough
neutral,the mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user mine did not come with the type receiver assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling the most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again you have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer lot there is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up it seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click button to start moving again slight annoyance not bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that am used to using the colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick 
neutral,redddr
positive,i have nerve damage in my hands so this keyboard is great in the fact that you can see hear and feel the keys also being lit up helps to find the key so much faster ve had it two weeks or so and no complaints 
positive,bought this at the beginning of july only used it times since am usually listening to headphones coming back from work and don bother to switch to portable speaker turned it on toward the end of july while making dinner and it played for few seconds then made crackling noise and stopped playing hitting the play pause button changes play pause on my phone so know it is connected but the speakers no longer work no start up noise or shut down noise either never dropped never got wet even though it should be water proof no abuse whatsoever just stopped working contacted customer support warranty at jbl if get an appropriate response the review may be updated when can actually use the product 
neutral,this speaker has such good sound quality we have bought multiple ones for family 
negative,this is the worst mouse ever it hard to glide and it goes dead very fast wish could return it 
neutral,your telephone sound quality is better then this speaker before you do mistake and waste your time think to get something else
positive,this mouse is perfect bought it to match with my keynote light up keyboard and it matches better than expected the colors change while gaming just as my keyboard does and it works perfectly for gaming and normal day to day use would buy again 
neutral,not very loud at all
positive, the black feels super soft just plugged it into my usb on my computer it also comes with usb adapter incase you don have that left and right button clicks softy not annoyingly middle scroll works great the click is bit louder and it won click onto document so that click that doesn do anything happy with this purchase it looks great at night and it such gamer music producer look 
neutral,they are not some high falootin fancy headphones with surround sound but the work sound good with no echo and steady bass treble and they were cheap 
positive,awesome keyboard
negative,the mouse does not hold charge it goes dead within hours 
positive,ehh it ok good hold me over
positive,really nice headset sounds good and all the cable is extremely long came all twisted up and the sound would cut if tried to untangle it so had to return it 
positive,nice size fits the palm very nicely led lightshow superfluous but can live with it my old mouse went to mouseville you know the one down in tallahassee fl lol nice mouse for the buck could do worse 
neutral,it cute mouse like the colors and it ergonomic however ve only had it for little over months and the scroll wheel just came loose and stopped working ve never had that happen with mouse so it not the best quality in the world 
neutral,good quality headset
positive,mouse works great better than expected 
neutral,while was excited about the headset sound quality could not wear it for more than few minutes it is extremely tight as result it kept pressing on my glasses shifting them around whenever moved my head additionally it pressed tightly on my earring which became painful very quickly if you have neither glasses nor earrings guess this is good option 
neutral,wheek scroll was brock
positive,use it with my laptop works perfectly 
neutral, for usd you can go wrong 
positive,for the price of the keyboard the quality is outstanding great feel built well looks nice overall came in nice sleek package with stickers as do all their products all can say is get yourself one and check it out yourself now for gaming it does great but if your serious tournament status then obviously you ll need wired keyboard other than that any games you enjoy playing will do fine personally play gta rp and ve had no problems works flawlessly all my fps have no issues either can move around and keys work in sync just fine multiple keys at once works all around great have mouse as well and same thing if your hesitant due to to the pricing don be you ll be happy and glad you made the purchase was skeptical myself and wasn expecting the quality to be that great took the chance and am glad did ll be purchasing more of their products moving forward 
neutral,good sound

positive,it is very straightforward product it has mic and the light features are cool to look at and just plug play no complaints about it so far 
positive,i tried to get my daughter nice mouse for her minecrafting and man what waste of this mouse was it connected to its included dongle just fine but almost broke nail taking the dongle out of the mouse body if you don have something slim to wedge in between the dongle and the mouse body prepare for some ouchies do you like the rainbow effect well hope you also enjoy less than day of battery life is your battery dead now welp can charge and use the mouse at the same time do you think it be nice to use long braided usb cord as wire for this mouse nope the micro usb only supports charging not data don hate yourself don get budget mouse if you want good mouse for roughly more check out the razer basilisk it supports bluetooth usb and it has excellent battery life my son uses it every day for minecraft roblox youtube and purchased it at the end of january it is now mid may and ve changed its single aa only once you won be disappointed 
neutral,jbl charge what trooper went through the window bent the metal frame and not scratch wish windows were this durable and girlfriends were more sane definitely sticking with jbl 
neutral,buzzing in the headset not compatible with xbox one
positive,works great no complaints 
positive,works perfectly and the bass it has is great 
positive,ergonomics are great quality is okay very lite weight and made of cheap plastic mouse pointer seems jumpy at times for no reason all in all would probably spend little more money if you can or want to so that you get better quality device 
positive,it great combination of excellent jbl quality and compact stylish looks the sound is incredible for such small package great features and an excellent price highly recommended 
positive,i set it up to my phone and when let it play the sound was really bad it wasn playing the song clearly that why would like to return it
positive,i love the different colors easy to find at night holds charge for few days 
neutral,box and packaging was great no physical damage to the head set but it doesn work took it out of the box to plug in and use and never even small noise was able to be heard smh they literally sold me broken product as if it was new and in perfect condition
positive,i use it to teach classroom music in some performing venues the volume is loud enough great feel in the hand convenient attractive unobtrusive design beautiful sound one drawback jbl stopped providing charging cube so you have to own one already or charge through usb 
positive,i only have issues for this item the charging cord fell apart month after received it the mouse its self stopped working few months after receiving it after reaching out to the manufacturer who promised to replace the item which never received am forced to buy another mouse but definitely not from this manufacturer 
positive,just received my mouse connected to computer immediately with no hassle works smooth no jerky motion guides to your movement without any hesitation quite buttons with feeling of padding underneath love it lights are beautiful 
neutral,i link it up to my for tv box while streaming movies use it in my car because my stock stereo is horrible love it more than any other speaker have ever used
positive,i really like my new mouse its light and works better with my hand the sleep mode is awesome my kids love the colors did some gaming last night and it worked great play league of legends 
neutral,bought it expecting to be able to use it and it didn have the adapter like it is stated 
negative,this mouse was awful it worked for few minutes and then stopped working you have to turn it off and back on again for it to work for minute changed the battery twice do not purchase 
positive,good quality mouse very easy to pair and it feels nice in your hand like the led touch
neutral,sucks that buys you keyboard that just dies after couple weeks know this only happens to some people that buy the product so if you wanna roll the dice go ahead 
neutral,i was excited to get mouse that was usb charge instead of batteries ive charged it once and it worked great for about week which is awesome but have been trying to charge it now for days and it will not accept charge im past my return window and cannot get my money back or exchange it for new one this is big bummer 
positive,a pretty decent headset bought this headset having very very high hopes for the mic specifically since my audio hadn been the best just through my laptop microphone but after using this headset for month or two have realized that the mic isnt actually that great it is mediocre at best and it commonly cuts out in voice calls the headset audio quality itself is honestly pretty good the mute and volume wheel were very convenient and you could really make your audio very loud with the volume wheel which was plus will say though that the led lights on the headset wont light up unless you plus the usb jack in which was big inconvenience for me when was still using wired mouse and after reading the reviews they rarely add that note but maybe just forgot to check the slides when buying this headset is also very very bulky which is personal ick for me when buying headsets its definitely not for minimalistic look but will say this is just personal preference overall its mediocre headset since its only you get what you pay for but theres definitely better headsets out there for the same price or save up just bit more money for highquality medium priced headset like the razer kraken steelseries arctics or hyperx cloud alpha headset 
positive,this is great mouse especially for the price it quickly responsive even after sleep mode like the look of it too 
positive,i originally bought the sony more bass model and swapped it out for this jbl the jbl blew it away sound nut and for the size of these speaker they sound great but two and pair them and get great stereo sound buy more than two and pair them all and the stereo sound goes away so ended up with just two of them and they are perfect be sure to download the app to get the stereo sound setting put one at each end of the pool and float away to great sound 
positive,works great but don like the lights going on when turn came computer on but does not go off when shutting down
negative,literally bought it today it connected at first and upon turning it off after and turning it on it did not want to connect at all gave it full charge and the battery only lasted up for min very disappointed
positive,these are impressive headphones for the price and the mic works great everything is crystal clear
positive,have to charge it twice day at least it is not comfortable too small to fit nicely in my hand the flow is choppy the cursor sticks it feels cheap like it is going to break at any second 
positive,this product works great got new laptop and needed mouse and the look of this was just what wanted the features are easy to use and it charges quickly would definitely recommend this product 
neutral,it fairly bright but you re stuck with the one rainbow color pattern and some of the colors are not as bright as others making typing in the dark harder than it should be the keys are raised up and beveled like keyboard from years ago so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboards this makes typing and accuracy little slower some of the keys are placed little weird too the key to the left of the enter key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark this one has the backslash and vertical line as was used to my last keyboard kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be ll likely be replacing this soon 
neutral,no usb only type c
positive,my son loves the headset he enjoys how it works 
positive, love it love rose gold so this was perfect you can have the lights like did or just solid color or off it is wireless and comes with charger and love the quite clicks
positive,love these headphones it my third pair ve bought and the wife loves here and have pair for company quality is awesome and perfect for gaming 
positive,i spent lot of time trying to find good portable speaker that sounded great and didn cost this is it it was worth the wait ll be getting second one as well 
neutral,bluetooth range is no problem rgb color is good keys are comfortable to use but two keys stopped working use the cue key for gaming so this basically defeats the purpose of buying this keyboard 
neutral,good
negative,wouldn spend your money on these cheaply designed broke within week volume is not that great save your money and spend little more to get decent pair
neutral,while re chargeable the battery life is terrible feels cheap and does not track well tossed in in the rubbish and purchased and amazon basics mouse less expensive and far more capable alternative 
positive,amazing
neutral,the wheel just spins and is not working anymore only days after purchased it returns are only within days can afford to buy new one every days so ll have to try different brand and seller 
negative,stopped working day and half after got it ve charged it and everything and it just won work good for the couple of hours that did use it thought the lights were pretty so give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was waste of my money since it no longer works 
positive,this came on time exactly as described it is quieter when you click the buttons than regular mouse it easy to charge and works well it wireless which is great it works perfectly with my sons laptop and the games he plays on it have no complaints would recommend to anyone 
positive,great investment
neutral,the motion is glitchy sometime it moves very slow tried different surfaces and it didn help it also goes to sleep even though took sleep mode off 
positive,my son loves them so do hes able to talk with his friends while playing its clear what he hears 
neutral,headphones lasted one week before the sound started cutting out you get what you pay for guess

neutral,really good quality
positive,great gaming experience
positive,it cute guess it is pretty cheaply made you can just tell by the feel of it got the matte black one it charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge love the nano usb plug it came with cord but just use my phone charger it does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom the instructions are all in chinese but using it is pretty easy the nano fits in little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter it is quite flat so not the best for long term use like with gaming ll keep it but wouldn purchase it again for the price update have used this cheap little mouse for hours every night since got it ve only had to charge it maybe once week the charge is phenomenal still works perfectly 
neutral,excelente producto 
neutral,highly recommend
neutral, liked the product while it lasted the few months it did it just stopped working out the blue 
positive,this product works great very lightweight and smooth easy to and use easy setup the lights on it makes it look so neat definitely recommend this product 
neutral,really like the mouse until months in it started having issues just trying to move the cursor across the screen became struggle 
positive,nice and light great sound and very happy with it 
positive,my grandson said it is very nice and is plenty loud enough he is happy with it 
positive,this mouse is amazing it is ergonomic cheap and functional defenitly great choice for business for games don have an opinion cause don play computer games 
positive,i live in the country and host or go to lot of bonfires and outdoor gatherings we discovered while ago that having radio wasn good enough between lack of music selection and constant commercials the jbl charge is perfect party speaker solution and going to leave my impressions based on that use the speaker is plenty loud if you re on deck patio and it placed several feet away you ll even need to turn it down to have normal conversation it doesn do as well at our large outdoor fire pit because of the bigger distances and lack of surroundings to close sound in that space is about feet from bench on one side of the fire pit to the other and in an open yard the speaker is still good just not great if you like loud commanding music as do if there is larger group of people like speaking at once for example it will not be able to overtake their voices and will be reduced to background music it will also be affected by big bonfire the waves of heat will actually distort the sound on the opposite side of the fire the sound clarity is good bass is nothing crazy but tight and does not distort or sound hollow as noted earlier volume really depends on how small space you re using it in and how many people are talking but even in the big open outdoor area it perfectly loud with only few people most importantly when turned all the way up it maintains clear clean sound and does not get distorted like other sound systems speakers do when you push them see some complaints about it being mono speaker but it sounds fine to me for what it is if want unparalleled sound eq customization and other features ll buy true audiophile equipment bluetooth is easy to connect and lifesaver technology in general if you have cellphone with enough bars and this speaker you can play as much music as you want bluetooth will stay connected at good distance ve walked about feet from the speaker and had no issues not many people would be streaming music very far away from the speaker imagine but it will tolerate reasonable distance charge time is definitely optimistic it advertised as being hours but ve not gotten close to that fully charged and playing continuously at full volume connected via bluetooth ve squeezed probably hours out of it which is still plenty often just let it charge from an outdoor outlet while playing music the speaker is definitely waterproof ve left it outside in the rain couple of times also let it sit on plastic chair with recess on the bottom it rained overnight and came out the next morning to find it submerged about an inch or so in puddle of water where it had sat for hours powered right up with no issues glad tested its abilities but hate to abuse neglect any of my stuff like that if you re doing something similar to me gathering several friends around chimenea on the patio or sitting out back by the fire pit this speaker is awesome and will be louder than you want when cranked up if you re looking to entertain large group of people who are going to be noisy it not the best choice but who really listening at that point anyway 
neutral,i was attracted to this keyboard due mainly to the colorful lighting but after couple of days of use just couldn handle the noise the spacebar made if you use the spacebar lot for gaming you may become distracted and irritated think liked the idea of this keyboard better than the keyboard itself 
positive,i guess almost year for under is good enough especially if you want one that recharges because you don like fooling around with aa batteries battery life was good could use it all day with no problems 
neutral,its cool mouse till had to recharge it plugged in the cable that came with it and it started getting hot until saw smoke ripped it out almost burned my self regular phone charger works fine tho 
negative,this keyboard worked for months one day it just stopped working walked away to get drink came back and none of the keys worked it would light up for second and turn off tried trouble shooting resetting and nothing helped 
positive,love it
neutral,my speaker is not performing to it fullest ability it too low 
neutral,i have not had to charge the keyborad or the mouse am on my computer lot and am still running the both of them from the time first intalled the 
positive,the mouse is contained in japanese package but was made in china it comes with the type adapter charging usb cable regular usb mouse receiver and thin instructions ve plugged the type adapter into two different machines with the same result neither laptops read the type directly or through another adapter ve also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type with the same results none of them work through this adapter other than that issue the mouse works it also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again the also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included just plug in the charging cord into an empty usb slot the color changing around the rim of the mouse gives nice touch and although at first the mouse feels long due to it sleek shape it does fit comfortably in the hand it also has plastic like feeling and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn malfunction or break 
positive,love this very sleek very quiet and actually love the lighting on the sides have had no issues plug and play 
neutral,cheap and awful product
neutral,my neighbor had this version of bluetooth speaker and bought one for myself to listen to tunes while sitting at my desk my coworkers love how it sounds it reception range the clarity without any distortion and it motivated one coworker to buy one for himself the battery stays charged for quite long time honestly can remember when charged it last but it was over weeks ago this is an item that doesn disappoint 
negative,the mouse is not effective charged for hours still no life or function do not buy when noticed that the mouse was not working charged it for hours tried the mouse again and it still did not work but showed red as one of the colors which may be warning the seller did not respond or reply to assist me with any troubleshooting unsatisfied customer

neutral,keyboard stopped working after month 
positive,very nice gaming headset high quality will update after long period of use happy with my purchase 
positive,overall the headset works really well it is really easy to set up and the sound is awesome the ear muffs make it easy to put on due to their large size my last headset would make my ears hurt this one has an easy mute button and the cord is made out of material that would make it last long time you really do not have to worry about it breaking and in the off chance it does the company provides great warranty for their products 
positive, finally sleep mode works on this upgraded led mouse sleep mode is must for mouse because not every time you ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for short break or so it does it for you to save battery note sleep mode does work on color mode the previous mouse wouldn sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse 
positive, love everything about this product like the setup and quick syncing to my monitor and system 
positive,these were in my desired price point dirt cheap and they have exceeded my expectations bought two pairs so my kid and could play co op missions on the switch together the noise cancelling works pretty well although definitely didn buy them for that feature microphone comes in clear and the volume knob and mic mute button are easy to reach very impressed 
neutral,it is so pretty the lights are gorgeous love that it is rechargeable but the roller in the middle broke and haven even had it for months use it for work so it doesn get lot of use either

positive,my son is rough on headsets so this is great headset for him without being too expensive they are really durable and the sound quality is really nice 
positive,the mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun it auto shuts off after minutes think which is great for saving the battery thought that having to put it on charger would be major inconvenience it not at all the recharge is quick and only do it once week so far

positive,the mouse is cool comfortable to use but not fan of the sleep mode it annoying but still like the mouse love the color shifting feature too
positive,the mouse feels amd looks great that the only positive aspect there is this thing cannot even connect to its own hardware so half the time you re just clicking happening this piece of garbage connects 
neutral,this was great mouse until it stopped working after about months of use mine appears to no longer charge therefore do not recommend buying this product

neutral,i needed small mouse for travel it working well it has dpi settings which haven explored yet not crazy about it being rechargeable prefer batteries but the rechargeable battery likely makes it lighter and smaller 
neutral,will not charge hold charge so doesn work upon arrival don waste your money spend the extra and get something that functions 
positive,i get so many compliments in the office about my mouse it huge hit in the office and now coworkers own it in different colors
neutral,center scroll wheel click functionality very spotty after mo of use now wheel won scroll at all disappointing 
positive,i bought this for my significant other solin he uses jbl pa self powered speakers on stands in his recording studio and on gigs he perfectionist and he hears everything in music if speaker has too much high end it too bright he likes warm analog type of sound he loves the beatles and portrayed john lennon in beatlemania so he has heavy beatles influence on his original music my year old nephew visited with this jbl bluetooth and was delighted that solin loved it and he said of course it great it jbl we absolutely love this speaker great quality great price 
positive,i really enjoying the quality of sound also find them comfortable 
positive,works very well on any surface colors flow well well worth the money

positive,works wonderfully in almost any situation loud when you want it to be works in big noisy rooms for background music or even to flush those out 
positive,i was searching for wireless mouse on amazon and for the price this was no brainer received this mouse in the mail in small compact packaging very simple and easy to get it going the charging cable that it comes with charged the mouse in about hours once plugged it in the mouse lit up blue and turned off once it was fully charged purchased the gray to match my laptop looks good and not as shiny as thought it would be which is great very comfortable with it in my hand and have pretty big hands really receptive to the movement when scrolling the lights feature is cool if you want to have something different the silent mouse clicking is great feature as well if you ever have to do work in quiet space you will not hear the loud clicking noise coming from this mouse very satisfied with this purchase so far 
neutral,stopped working after two or so months of having it 
neutral,our bose died bought this as replacement very nice
positive,at first glance the keyboard looks and feels nice the keys are decently silent though very loud compared to my other low profile minimalistic keyboard and the rgb is cool however there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use the function key is on the right side of the spacebar which is non standard so very weird to use keyboard shortcuts like ctrl shift for dev tools in chrome am programmer only works on the right side of the keyboard not the left which used to and works on every other keyboard ve ever used and the issue cannot be fixed with the klim reset keyboard combo so you re stuck with the issue the rgb is somewhat faint and even on the static setting doesn stay on it dims after not very long at all of inactivity making me have to constantly type to keep it onoverall would save your money you could get much better keyboard for the same price that doesn have the glitches or annoyances honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that klim continues to sell known defective product without offering returns what sham 
positive, so colorful and bright moves with ease very happy with my product
positive,exactly what wanted and expected love the colors 
positive,works great but don like the lights going on when turn came computer on but does not go off when shutting down
positive,dad bit deaf and had bose stuff in the past he asked me to order him bose version of this after some research bought this instead jbl charge dad loves it it works great and plays loud sound quality is better than would have expected from small speaker but it mono speaker so not exactly highfi and it in no way reference monitor for what it is it great

neutral,i only used it for week and the scroller stopped working
positive,awesome gear 
neutral,never buy this product when buy something usually look at product reviews but this product seems to have lot of problems unlike reviews don usually post reviews but posting this product review in hopes that there won be victims like me bought mouse and it worked fine at first but after charging it it started to get weird and didn work at all so thought there might be small problem so exchanged the new one instead of refund received new mouse and it worked fine for another few days but after charging it again it didn work the product user manual says it is sensitive to charging but this is serious problem bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire but think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem 
positive,i used this keyboard for remote work after months of having it the letter went out other than that it worked great 
neutral,long battery life due to sleep mode was impressed until scroll wheel stopped working would have otherwise recommended highly

positive,i get so many compliments about this mouse move location to location for my job and it held up just fine quiet click smooth functionality fun color changing led love it the only negative is that the charging cord is short and doesn also operate the mouse when plugged in so make sure you have two usb plugs when needing charge

neutral,it doesn have solid lighting doesn match my red themed pc mouse mousepad setup 
positive,i like the mouse originally thought it wast great for the price and glad to be wrong the mouse is little sensitive because dropped it once causing it to freeze somewhat however after re installing it it seemed to fix the issue also am enjoying the colour changing which helps me relax almost overall highly recommend as it is compatible with pc and mac just plug and play

neutral,the quality was really good
positive,it is lite weight works well so far but only have it for week will post back in month have been using it for about weeks need to charge it every days that is bit faster then would like the reason dropped this from five stars to fours stars is it dies boom good then bad when it needs the charge don like to be surprised by working keyboard then dead one without warning when it works like it like the feel and find it nice for blogging but could be writing here then dead almost instantly this means have to keep track of when to charge it have to work bit extra to not get caught off guard will come back and review it in six months hope the battery keeps taking charge am thinking this was not my best choice use it hours day not typing constantly but still hitting the keys fairly often it is lit night to day and the charge runs down fairly quickly wish it had larger battery my fear is it will not take charge after six months use if you are going to type lot and constantly don buy this 
neutral,good quality

neutral,it is used for gaming cushion inside the ear could be improved 
negative,i bought this in june it is october now the left side of my keyboard keys work intermittently which is annoying when typing paragraph or more and it is filled with mistakes think the rest is going to fail soon complete waste of you can find something better 
positive,i love this keyboard love that it wireless it came charged so plugged it into my child computer and they were able to use it right away love that it fairly quiet typing the backlight goes off quickly which think is good because it saves battery the one thing personally don like is the placement of the return key and the backslash key used to the backslash key being above the return and the return key being more horizontal super small detail that is taking time for me to get used to but would still recommend this keyboard because it great overall 
positive,you may be thinking that you are typing everything as expected later you will realize that kb stopped typing or missing some characters in the middle of your writing worst buy from amazon dear amazondo not allow to tarnish your reputation customer trust is the important factor for you right please help your customers do perfect quality test 
positive,my son loves it he loves the way it lights up win win for mommy

neutral,after one month the mouse would not stay turned on even though it appeared to be fully charged will not buy rechargable again
positive,sound quality is good very good battery life and design good speaker to have around the house or while working out in the home gym however not loud enough for wind beach day 
neutral,the headset was uncomfortable and heavy the plastic felt cheap and it looks better in the picture all around couldn have rated this any higher than one star 
neutral,portabe durable in all types of weather conditions nice balance of high mid and low end frequency
positive,the mouse is really quiet no clicking sound which liked comfortable for the hand does not hold charge very long and nothing worse than not responding during middle of the work day had tried to different brands the other was one that had bluetooth feature so could use it on my tablet that held charge all week and will be getting another one of those 
neutral,it really is
neutral,the battery life is not hours not by long shot
positive,update not sure why but this mouse is working better than it did when originally purchased it back in october use it every day and don mind charging it over night every couple of days or so it is comfortable to use and kind of funky in good way to use the changing lights feature from time to time naturally this will make the battery run down faster but once in while enjoy the light show lol and love how the click is so quiet they say they ve upgraded this product so hope you ll give it try too original review october my use of this mouse consists of following hours of use without the pretty little alternating lights on and then it switched off for the night before my next hours are over this thing runs out of life and must be charged again not at all thrilled with it it does have nice quiet click but if have to charge it every time use it don think it will last very long 
positive,the slim design feels amazing the price is perfect and the lights on it just make it fun worth it 
negative,bad wireless don always work

neutral,works well
negative,awful sound quality mic sounds worse then international phone call and they feel extremely uncomfortable and stuff returned immediately 
positive,i am pleasantly surprised by this mouse don use them in general often but ended up buying one because my laptop doesn love to let me use the keypad and wasd while gaming without delaying one or the other slightly wasn necessarily expecting transitioning to using mouse to be easy but it really has been it has no lag while gaming at all is very smooth gliding doesn hurt my wrists at all and holds charge for long time have forgotten to turn it off several times and gone back to use it few days later and it was still plenty charged enough for couple of hours of gameplay highly recommended 
neutral,mouse takes long time to connect and spend way to long to try to make it work it got here fast though
negative,sick piece
positive,works well special features are fun
positive,i love this mouse ve had others before but never like this it was so easy to connect just plug in the usb connector and thats it no drivers to install or to download works right out the box its so natural when using this mouse even used it when was in the coach and it worked perfectly on the arm rest would recommend this all day good product 
neutral,hot garbage sounds okay but the mic is trash 
positive,got this gift for my husband cause was tired of tripping over the cords personally love the fact don have to trip and hubby is happy as well 
neutral,cool and cheap however just know buying keyboard this cheap the battery life is not very good at all 
negative,the audio is mostly decent but as soon as started talking all my friends told me sounded so badly should go back to my old mic bad output just slightly uncomfortable but not too bad overall
positive,this was gift for someone who is as familiar with the product as am have used this speaker in small public address capacity as well as personal listening device and it performs wonderfully best bang for the buck highly recommended 
negative,i received of these for christmas they both stopped working within the first weeks of having them emailed customer service as they tell you to and never got response emailed them twice junky and waste of money for the purchaser who gifted them to me

neutral,the mouse is cute and light but it doesn consistently work throughout the day it will be working and then all of sudden it will be non responsive and has to be turned off and back on to get it to work again would not recommend 
positive,harmon kardon has better bass fursure and quality is better the only cool thing about jbl is the water proof im never gunna be in the water soo they got me on that just get harmon kardon onyx round bt speaker trust me on that one plus its big with not enuff bass like mon man foreal smh 
neutral,this mouse was extremely cheap
positive,so do like that the mouse fits well in my hand is very responsive and works very well for everyday use like that the mouse click is very quiet have had no problems with the mouse so far would recommend this mouse as it works very well and you can also adjust the sensitivity or how fast it tracks by adjusting the dpi nice feature to have 
positive,this mouse is amazing it has completed my work from home station and has made my desk look less cluttered what love about it the most is the led lights would never definitely buy and recommend this to other people 
positive,this thing is durable beast much better bass than the jbl flip but it is also much larger not too large to not bring places but large enough that it isn quite as back pack portable as the flip if you are looking for mildly portable car camping speaker then look no further this charge is the bomb 
neutral,i loved this product but when went to remove it from the usb slot the inner part broke off inside the computer 
positive,amazing noise canceling ability and one of the best gaming headset have ever used super comfortable and top quality sound 
neutral,my mouse is not working properly just purchased it not even week ago sending it back

neutral,using this every friday for background music at community event good sound quality 
positive,my first jbl speaker and plan on buying more after purchasing this one the battery on this thing is amazing excellent sound as expected from the jbl brand and great sound for the size phone always connects easy and charges it fast as well just want to buy more because hear jbl speakers connect fast and easy with one another 
positive,sound quality is pretty good for the price higher end products have better clarity but well worth it for kids
positive,love it 
positive,just got this headset it an amazing headset just to game and daily things highly recommend it 
positive,the charge will connect with boombox other charge charge will not connect to anything so don bother trying bought new renewed neither connected the connect button acting like the blue tooth button jbl dropped ball on it fixed it on charge ue booms are best for connecting their price sound quality is better than jbl but jbl has better base response when you want to play speaker loud 
positive,i bought this mouse to replace an older one that had just cracked love the feature of charging them by usb in place of batteries so much more convenient easy to setup mouse clicks are completely silent which is also nice feature the changing led color light on the inside is just bonus that makes it looks cool comfortable use slim design and really like the no slip material of the mouse 
positive, love this mouse it super cute and lightweight love the led lights option paired perfectly with my macbook
negative,feels very cheap and performs cheap too both sides stick together when wanting to use just the left side button but they both go down and pop wen going back up difficult to click on just single item 
neutral,i love the look of this mouse and it was easy to install unfortunately the gold has started to peel after only month of use ve passed the return window so this is disappointing 
neutral,ordered these in october and the left ear stereo is now gone ve had other headphones that have lasted longer then this will not be purchasing these again update company got ahold of me sent brand new set gonna change the score based on the customer service alone but we will see how long these lasts will update the review accordingly if you do get them get warranty you ll need it before long 
neutral,love th wmouse but my wheel to scroll broke so be careful
negative,i have now purchased of these computer mice both of which have broken and become unusable within just few weeks with the first one thought got defective item so returned it and got the same model again for exchange now that one has broken too conveniently just days outside the return window in both instances the click wheel stopped functioning making scrolling impossible these were handled with care in my home office and not used improperly or dropped or exposed to moisture etc they just seem very cheaply made the led lights were nice feature but meaningless without functioning mouse as far as the ergonomics often found my hand hurting the mouse is so low profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver do not recommend this product 
positive,this is great wireless mouse at great price it comes with usb charger and quickly connected to my laptop it feels great on my palm and the cursor moves around the screen smoothly love the ability to change the mouse lighting and love how lightweight but durable it is 
neutral,i assumed this speaker had bump and more than speaker inside well was wrong big time it speaker on the right and it only gets loud with volume cranked all the way up had aomias speaker that bumped louder and was for only this speaker is overpriced for what it offers only goo thing is the charge port is usb which doesn break as easy as the standard android port 
positive,overall great product at great price 
positive,we bought speakers to see which one we loved more this was the note expensive one and after we tried then both it wasn even close the quality of this speaker was awful compared to an off brand and it was half the cost wouldn spend this type of money on it just for the name there are better ones that are way better and cheaper 
neutral,this was pretty frustrating to use it kept shutting off and the tracking was pretty awful ended up throwing it away after about two weeks worth of use 
neutral,trash bought it to play final fantasy which working dad so don get to play too much it spends most of its time on the dresser plugged in to ps left it on few times and now it stopped working all together buy at your own risk 
positive,so easy to pair sound is excellent
positive,this keyboard was easy to set up however the user manual that you can download is not in english use the fn key to adjust the lights very cool keyboard 
positive,really great mouse and affordable to buy and its mouse click is super smooth love it so much
neutral,easy to use
positive,really surprised with this headset my turtle beaches went out and bought these as cheap replacement tried it out today and it works above and beyond of what thought get for the mic is good and clear but what shined for me was the noise cancellation and base that had nice kick to it very happy with it 
positive,the quality is great would buy it again 
neutral,the mouse worked fine at first then the battery stopped holding charge for long time after month it stopped working completely 
positive,it very good gaming headset that has very good noise canceling and allows to focus
neutral,the headphones have pretty good sound quality and mic quality for the price not very much noise cancelling but that doesn matter much to me 
neutral,wouldn even mind the fact that have to keep it plugged in of the time if it actually stayed plugged in 
positive,i got this to use at work because wireless works lot better for my desk set up ve had no issues and backlight is great charge lasts around to weeks using on regular work day schedule the keyboard is pretty quite and is responds with decent speed 
neutral,seems nice enough in the hand but didn work could click both the left and right mouse buttons but moving the mouse would not do anything had to return 
positive,absolutely love this for ps gaming 
positive,a gift for my grandson and he loves them 
positive,crystal clear separation between instruments little tinny and heavy on the bass for the money love it highly recommend 
positive,love it works great with the switch
neutral,cool headphones
neutral,will not charge hold charge so doesn work upon arrival don waste your money spend the extra and get something that functions 
neutral,i ordered my first one in april and had to replace it in june because dropped it and the mouse wheel stopped working got the new one june th and today once again the mouse wheel stopped working out of nowhere it barely even lasted three months
neutral,not for regular or big hands
neutral,worked for few months then stopped intermittently 
neutral,i wanted it without the dongle
positive,i like that they aren to loud and very clear very comfortable 
positive,awesome keyboard for gaming at this price
negative,falls asleep entirely to quickly midtyping and the keyboard is asleep horrible for gaming as the lag is sometimes to seconds between key being pressed and actually recognizing it was pressed customer support page contact seller brings up an atv page and they dont help 
positive,love it came several days early and am so pleased my only grievance is that it didn come with charger box 
positive,i love the clarity and the bass especially how loud it gets worth the money 
positive,won hold charge haven been able to use since ve got it cause it won turn on after multiple attempts
positive,works great and the dpi does all need it too
positive,son loves it
neutral,not even month and it broken
neutral,loved the product at first actually bought two after couple weeks they quit charging and now they no longer work 
positive,great mouse got this because my laptop had to many wires sticking out everywhere this has been great to free up the mess of wires and make my work day easier 
neutral,i love this mouse works and looks great for the price very comfortable and smooth operation the charging cable that came with it didn work though but had another one so no biggie 
positive,i bought this keyboard for work because my keys were getting jammed have to say this keyboard feel great while typing like that it can be used as either wired or wireless one of the best parts is the rechargeable battery 
positive,the pairing between speakers is easily interrupted and interferes with they are constantly cutting out probably really only good for single speaker use and not pairing of them together as advertised everything else about this speaker is awesome through it in snowbank last weekend after having it for several months and it sounded great and continued working figured if the pairing sucked then would start testing out the other features they advertise water resistance was successful test 
positive,i ve had the mouse for about month and it works great use it everyday for work hours and ve only have had to charge it once after the initial charge recommend for sure 
neutral,i bought this because it is gaming headphone and the reviews looked to be good quality however plugged it into my pc and at first only the audio output was working and recognized on my computer when unplugged it to see if that would fix the microphone not being recognized the sound stopped working ran troubleshoot program and the pc doesn even acknowledge the headphones being plugged in with the jack looked online its very common problem 
positive,fitting is great sound quality is great loving everything about it 
neutral,i have only used this shirt time it alright it does take minute to get used to the low profile my biggest complaint is that it didn come with charger as stated now have to find charger that will fit or spend more money to purchase charger just to ensure can recharge it 
positive,so far it works great
neutral,i am sorry my fault 
positive,awesome
positive,this mouse is very slim and is comfortable on your wrist the colors are really cool and mouse battery goes for couple of days
positive,i bought one of these for my son to replace the old broken one he had after getting this setup tried them and was pretty impressed with the sound quality so ordered another one honestly for the price it exceeds my expectation it works and the bass is solid buy it 
neutral,i like the fact that it lights not only can you see it in the dark but it alerts you when the batteries or low
positive,it says so in the info but if you re like me you go right to reviews lol have tested it with my ps fits great over my glasses ll update once use it more updatei forgot to update this before but these headphones works fine lights included they are comfortable and work with my android phone as well 
positive,i purchased one of these about months ago for regular use found the sound quality to be very good owned an older jbl speaker that failed within months the warranty return was hassle so am pleased that this model has performed well prefer that tactile buttons as it makes it easier to find buttons in dark situation as well as while driving also like the usb connection the older jbl with micro usb port failed from wear and tear can no longer charge that one and repairing it is not cost effective the only demerit can say is this unit is bit heavy to carry around and listen to music it more for placing in static location do want to note the sound does tend to come from one side of the unit it not it also isn stereo speaker that means one driver with channels merged not important for me the phone app allows for creating stereo sound from individual units verified that purchased nd unit during the holiday sale and would recommend this speaker to good friend 
neutral,superd 
positive, sooo this thing is so cute for starters it light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily the buttons aren hard and actually it easier to click on different things only negatives have when it goes into sleep mode have to turn it on and off and the second thing is pro and con for me the usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy just wish it had latch release had to use card to pop it out other than those things it great didn even have to charge it when took it out the box 
positive,i like how the noise canceling was good quality and will last long time
neutral,i really like the rechargeable feature instead of going thru all the batteries 
neutral, it cute and light weight but one drop and it done for literally dropped it once and it now doesn work 
positive,great item
positive,it pretty much works like it said it would wish the ears were little bit more comfortable better than that 
positive,it super cute and love how it lights up which is probably the reason why the charge doesn last very long just make sure you stay on top of it and it will work trying to avoid buying one with batteries but this one is in any better 
positive,love the slimness of the mouse without loosing great functionality the re charge feature is great 
positive,bought the headphones for my year old and he loves them he says the sound is clear and the headphones fit his head perfectly noticed it has some noise cancellation but he can still hear me when speak to him product works well and is durable recommend the buy 
neutral,wire is broken within month contacted seller and got refund immediately now they are changing vendor to get good quality wire 
positive,prior to this had jbl flip for few years before it finally died decided to go for this charge rather than another flip since wanted little more volume out in the garage this charge has surpassed my expectations it significantly louder than the flip but never loses clarity even at high volumes the audio is clean and bass is very good as well the biggest surprise has been the battery life feel like the speaker gets used constantly but it only needs to be recharged once week or so it also waterproof which makes it super easy to clean all in all couldn be happier 
neutral,i just wanted colorful mouse and this is what expected its okay in ergonomics but do not know much about ergonomics its okay for gaming but its not the best since its more of office type mouse 
negative,battery died after mins with or without the color changing lights on this thing is useless
neutral,stopped working days after the day cutoff for returns it worked great while could use it but of course this is unacceptable won buy from this seller again 
positive,wife loves it she uses it daily with no issues led is nice and bright would be nice to add larger capacity battery 
neutral,only worked for week
positive,i don game that intensely more of hobby to stay in touch with out of town friends this headset was affordable and definitely fits my needs 
neutral,i an oontz angle guy these jbl have way to much bass don know how this is star product they may be deaf or hard at hearing it just straight bass 
positive,the pros decent mouse for what needed like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging the cons these first two are mostly preferences so take them however you wish it sits fairly flat so there isn much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in mouse this just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences secondly it has silent soft click normally when you click mouse you feel and hear the click of the button this feels more like am pressing on touch screen there is no satisfying click nor is there sudden give in the button rather it feels like poking couch cushion this could be what you want in mouse so do with this info what you will this last con is not based on preferences however found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when am moving the mouse to the right with the dual screens have this means that end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close tab or select tool in my adobe programs it nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile but it was enough to stand out and earn it place in this review 
positive,paid for the razer blackshark gaming headset months ago and the mic doesn work most of the time specifically while playing fortnite on ps paid for this bengoo stereo gaming headset and the speakers and mic sound and work fantastic don pay more 
positive,was my daughter birthday present she is extremely pleased thank you very much 
neutral,after just three months this mouse no longer charges so it useless spend few extra dollars and get better mouse

neutral,item defective
neutral,a 
positive,the headset is great it very comfortable the sound is really clear and can really go up it has great design and seems durable the only apparent problem is that people around me hear the voice bit but it no biggie for me 
positive,working great plugged in or wireless have no problem so far
neutral,my son saved up bought them on prime day could not be happier
positive,lightweight amazing customer sevice 
positive,had high hope for this cute product was very disappointed for starters the charging light did not work so couldn tell if it was charging at all when tried it the next day after charging it did work only directly plugged into my mac wouldn work in my adaptor which is another issue and it worked that day the next day it would not work already annoyed as wasn looking to charge this all day to work for only work hours did turn it off after each use as well the next day it worked for even less time maybe only couple of hours this mouse is cheap junk and don recommend it to anyone 
positive,this headset is pretty darn great however feel like the volume cap could stand to be bit higher other than that like it 
neutral,no charger cable how do supposed to charge it
neutral,every time use the mouse there is this high pitched noise hurts my ears
positive,so far so good
neutral,i needed stereo for my boat what got is not only great sound but can move it anywhere want music
positive,i was desperately in need of new keyboard and thought might as well upgrade to wireless board and mouse combo for the price and shipping speed was very excited for this product however it would not connect for longer than just few keystrokes then it would be unresponsive until left it alone for few minutes then could type another characters before starting the process over again promptly returned it and really like my new setup granted had to wait little longer will say this keyboard had great feel and excellent footprint for smaller desk it seemed fairly easy to be able to carry around with laptop although not recommended 
neutral,i purchased this mouse for home office don have glass table but guess surface is too smooth for it to work silent operation very comfortable battery lasts decent time lasted for week straight without turning it off not returning it but not super happy with the issue 
positive,great product very durable and the battery life is huge plus it fallen off tables and in water and not dent on it or any change in sound 
neutral,looked cool cancels sound ok but def hard to hear xbox or tablet laptop audio at full volume and also def not good for game chat or work calls on laptop for both parties
positive,great headset fits comfy and sounds great cool led lights 
neutral,works great sleeps and comes out of sleep easily colorfully not too bright to be distraction 
positive,slick beautiful mouse for all apps love that led display on the mouse
neutral,it worked for min and then got stuck in my laptop looks like made of cheap material
neutral,i bought this mouse and the thing barely moves across the screen not traction it very cheaply made would not recommend at all needed one fast cause my old one is going ve had for years this mouse will not last four years 
positive,love this speaker it the best portable one ve had yet and have bought many speakers
neutral,product is as described pleased with my purchase 
negative,i bought this mouse and use it for the first time yesterday and charged it last night and now the mouse will not turn on definite waste of money 
positive,once you configure this as your default it is simply fantastic sound is crisp and clear and the microphone is equally as good use it for gaming and online studying the noise deadening eliminates distractions which is very helpful 
positive,bought for my yo and he loves them the led lights look super cool 
negative,these just died no help with replacing them they are only months old do not buy 
neutral,piece of crap
positive,awesome product
positive,comfortable to use
neutral,this mouse is so hard to use that scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys push the left button times it might place the cursor select the word or do nothing depends on the mouse gods if you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you finally get it where you want and if you type nothing happens this thing is trash buying logitech mouse to replace 
negative,the scroll wheel stopped working after month very frustrated 
neutral,the sound is fine but the mic is not good 
positive,battery life has been great so far it goes to sleep mode when not in use but there also on off function love that you can charge it also just plug it in once every few days overnight 
positive,great set
positive,need to use it when my computer comes in for valid review but looks good
positive,i love the color and how slim it is use it for work school 
positive,i bought this mouse to match the keyboard bought for my daughter to use with her laptop she does online school and likes having mouse as well as keyboard she likes that they match and both light up didn know how it would be for gaming 
neutral,ok
positive,the gaming headset is pretty good for such low price 
neutral,not sure why but it kept dying real quick 
neutral,i believe this is the first time jbl has released the white color for the charge series speakers owned black charge and charge speakers in the past and like all of the them the black ones look classic and the white one looks modern and trendy 
positive,pretty cool my boy like it works very well with the nintendo switch 
positive,i bought it at for that price it is finitively good price well other speaker is th revovle plus from bose so hard to compare not the same range of price neither power but this is nice handy sound system 
positive,it nice sleek mouse and works relatively well until it stops charging had bought it early march this year and now early may it won charge making it hunk of useless plastic buy with the expectation you will have to buy again and not very long thereafter 
positive,battery life is great and has good amount of bass but you won be able to feel it after you move away from the the speaker it sounds better when connected to my iphone than it does connected to my samsung haven tried out the charge feature yet though
neutral,the window passed to return used for week really need to press the buttons to get it to work irritatingbetter action on cheap corded board 
negative,a very nice upgrade and replacement mouse with no cords and no batteries perfect 
neutral,do not recommend this product it was super cheap feeling and did not work well at all 
neutral,i loved it until it stopped working today
neutral,title says all good for the price but the usb is literally for lights only and the mic mute button doesn work as basic generic headset though 
neutral,it cute pink is just like the picture it really nice mouse but sad that it doesn work with my ipad put photos of the manual and it says that mouse needs usb port to operate think that black usb goes into computer and communicates with the one beneath the mouse 
positive,is great 
neutral,usb adapter doesn work and light on mouse fuzzes out when plugged into different computer that allows for usb 
positive,as advertised love that you can really hear the clicks charge it once week and use it approx to hrs week on color changing setting easy set up would buy again only thing don like is the short charging cable which is personal preference you would need usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it charging 
positive, aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow like how it wireless and it can even work from small distance away on another table from separate from my computer it works very well it has an on and off button for storage 
neutral,liked it lot until it stopped working after only using it intermittently for couple months no longer will right click
neutral, 
positive,purchased this for my son he could hear and be heard clearly wish the usb cord was detachable as we will not be using it with computer wished there was way for it to light up while playing video games great value for the money 
neutral,my husband likes these so much this is the second pair we bought one for me now
positive,awesome
positive,its amazing 
positive,sweet sleek mouse with nice color can wait till its nighttime to show it off
negative,i have been using for about weeks and it died it will not charge 
positive,since mainly draw art didn see need to have bulky gaming mouse this fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when drawing at night while the family is asleep the ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option it good buy for casual office or laid back working experience 
neutral,sounds great but battery only lasts about hours at full blast
positive,the headset is perfect for gaming purposes the sound quality is extravagant
positive,third different one purchased like this because of all the positive reviews can believe them garbage right out of the box again won pair with the usb receiver won hold battery charge all done with these rechargeable garbage wireless mice 
neutral,good
negative,decent while it worked though waking from sleep required switching it off back on underneath the laser stopped working fully charged up only color lights work making it useless 
neutral,good product
positive,okay so ordered the jbl speaker because my mother day was coming up and my mom had always wanted her own speaker gifted it and it was working fine until like the nd month of having it it would shut off and on and it just won stay on even tho we ve charged it all night and still it won function so until get an answer back or way can fix this not so happy with it but other family members have purchased and came out fine so really don know what happen 
positive,it has amazing quality for gaming highly suggest this item
positive,best portable speaker ve ever purchased this thing booms 
positive,excellent product works great as well as being affordable along with having great customer service highly recommend for all people looking for new keyboard 
positive,i bought this for home office and liked it so much bought second one for work to use instead of what the company supplied to me it everything the description says it is very comfortable too 
neutral,this item came broken we tried charging it over night but it never worked had to return it
positive,excellent headset for the price easy to use with windows plug and play sits over the ear so the noise cancelling is passive you can still somewhat hear things going on around you but its not disturbing
positive,this came so safely packaged so it wouldn break recommend getting this good sound connects easily and the battery lasts long good for listening loud music 
neutral,i mainly use it for music its good 
negative,this mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and half at two weeks it seemed to glitch the cursor would jerk and freeze so connected the mouse to the charger it was ok for couple of days but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon very cheaply made product maybe those star reviews are bought very disappointing 
neutral,quiet and smooth
positive,i took my charge speaker camping with me and was really happy with how it sounded and how easy it was to charge my phone with it buddy of mine had another jbl speaker and we were able to connect them using the app and it was game changer we had occasional spots where the music got garbled but overall it was great experience 
positive,i love how you don need battery just recharge it great and colorfull 
neutral,this mouse works for mins or less at time then has to be powered off and on it starts lagging charged it all night so its not battery issue and it only works when its all lit up not in the mode
negative,not for touch typing keyboarding backstory bought two of these one use in my classroom so when in the front of my room can type urls or hit the escape button love that it is back lit as often have lights off in my room during presentations or videos however bought second one for home and cannot type on it am old school and learned touch typing and do so at very fast pace but this keyboard has an extra key between the letter and the enter key therefore hit that key instead of the enter key every time very frustrating quickly returned it as it is useless to me 
neutral,i bought five of them this year and three already broke after few months of light use two had the plastic wheel axle broken the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by windows anymore in addition the usb dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop usb port this mouse is flimsy and does not last not very ergonomical as well cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse but it eats battery avoid 
neutral, bought this on sale at target because needed it at that moment great sound quality just disappointed it mono and not stereo 
neutral,purchased back in november thought this keyboard would have lasted lot longer when first purchased the keyboard it worked fine on my pc after month it stopped working and gave message saying the bluetooth software is outdated went to the klim website to update the bluetooth by downloading file that didn work connected the keyboard to another pc still would not work literally the keyboard stopped working after month due to the bluetooth being outdated or not compatible what waste of money 
positive,i ve used this keyboard for couple months and am completely happy the keys are satisfying to press the battery life is long and the aesthetic is great 
positive,works well silent durable so far so good 
positive,the keyboard remains responsive and in perfect working order after month of regular use do have fancy logitech gaming keyboard with all the bells and whistles but prefer the quiet keys of the klim quiet doesn mean unresponsive in this case the keys feels sturdy and satisfying love that it uses usb for charging or wired gaming and the battery life is surprisingly long 
neutral,good sound but as much definition as it can be expected for the price 
neutral,this is high quality and nice looking
neutral,i could not rate the other categories ergonomics sleep mode or gaming because it never worked wish had paid more attention to the star reviews unfortunately missed the return by date wish had paid more attention to the star reviews do not buy 
neutral,good sound quality mic needed work 
positive,i love this mouse got the pink gold rose one it first of all so elegant and the best part is that it mute the clicks are soft and smooth 
negative,i barely used this keyboard as purchased it over winter break days into it and it started lagging and wouldn accept all they keys would push and lag overall big disappointment skip this and pay for better quality keyboard connectivity issues seems to be the problem cheaply made 
positive,feels great nice color looks like it will last very long time charge last along time as well 
positive,so far so great no loud clicks and feels good in hand 
positive,it would sometimes require extra force to register the click so definitely don recommend it for gaming the optics worked very well so it definitely good normal use mouse 
positive,i did so much research and ended up with this model and could not be happier the sound quality is amazing and it could get so loud it could fill up the whole downstairs if wanted got the white color and it looks so good 
positive, so far so good had previous mouse that gave out after months and check the cool colors 
neutral,the cursor skips all over the place you have no idea what you re clicking this mouse is now in my garbage buy different mouse 
positive,bought it for my son he loves it great quality works great for playstation 
positive,great quality and sound for the price
neutral,cool product for kid if the scrolling wheel in middle doesn keep breaking 
positive,they work great feel great on
neutral,dissatisfied with purchase mouse works except for the scrolling wheel 
negative,do not buy this bought this in august st return period is only days and it stopped working in october rd tried different charging cords thought maybe it was the cord but no lock just completely dead 
positive,great product fast delivery
